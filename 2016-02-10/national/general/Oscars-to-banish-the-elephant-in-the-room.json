Minutes before, Mr. Kaufman, at Table 19, had been puzzling over the problem of reporting news from an event that, by design, generates so little.\n\nMs. Isaacs\u2019 message, firmly and briefly delivered, was simply that the Oscar rituals \u2014 including its awards ceremony, set for broadcast on February 28 \u2014 will proceed as planned, no matter the debate about their validity or racial balance.\n\nLuscious menu\n\nWhat was on the table? Chilled beet salad with wild arugula, cedar-planked arctic char, and something called chocolate royaltine crunch. With berries. And Chantilly cream. And mango coulis. Plus assorted truffles.\n\nThese nominees, most of them, are show business troupers, and most have learned to make the most of their Chantilly cream-covered ride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to enjoy it, because it is pretty wonderful,\u201d said best supporting actress nominee Alicia Vikander, swathed in bright red, as she answered questions in the luncheon\u2019s pre-show interview room.\n\nShe had learned that lesson, Ms. Vikander said, from Eddie Redmayne, her co-star in The Danish Girl , and another of this year\u2019s nominees, for best actor. Mr. Redmayne was on hand, looking dapper in a sharp gray suit.\n\nBy Ms. Isaacs\u2019 count, about 150 nominees showed up. Whether or not viewers tune into the show on ABC in 20 days, those honoured clearly intend to be there.\n\nMatt Damon, nominated for best actor for The Martian , was at the luncheon, talking to Hollywood executives and Oscar voters during the noontime cocktail hour. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
