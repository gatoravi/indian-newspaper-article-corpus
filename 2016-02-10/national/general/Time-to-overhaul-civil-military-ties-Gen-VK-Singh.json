    "text": "The civil-military relations in this country need an overhaul to get over the impression that the armed forces will topple the civilian system of this country, said General V.K. Singh, former Army Chief and Minister of State for External Affairs, on Tuesday. He was speaking at the launch of the book 1962: The War That Wasn\u2019t written by Shiv Kunal Verma.\n\n\u201cThe psyche has continued since Independence, and the psyche is that the armed forces are the naughty boys, they will probably do something and they need to be kept under total control. It got perpetrated over time,\u201d Gen. V.K. Singh said.\n\nStating that the Henderson Brooks report, which did a post-mortem on the 1962 war, would be declassified soon, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said the war was mainly a psychological failure.",
