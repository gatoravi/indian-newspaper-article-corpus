    "text": "Indian women are no longer \u201cpassive recipients\u201d of the state\u2019s welfare schemes, but active agents of change. Real development is only possible with their economic empowerment, the Supreme Court has observed in a judgment.\n\nIn a 38-page verdict highlighting how women have progressed from being the protected to becoming the protector, a Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and A.M. Sapre said they had become \u201cdynamic promoters of social transformation that can alter the lives of both women and men.\u201d\n\nThe judgment came in a case of a woman police officer, Richa Mishra, who was denied selection as Deputy Superintendent of Police on the ground that she was overage. The apex court directed the Chhattisgarh government to appoint her in the senior rank after agreeing with her contention that there was a 10-year relaxation in age limit for women candidates under the service rules that was solely meant to encourage women like her.\n\nAs India promotes Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (Education for girls) scheme, \u201cempowerment of women is the need of the hour,\u201d the Supreme Court said. Women in this world, and particularly in India, faced various kinds of constraints and discrimination. This was notwithstanding the fact that under the Constitution, women enjoyed a status of equality with men. \u201cIn reality, however, they have a long way to go to achieve this constitutional status,\u201d Justice Sikri, who wrote the verdict for the Bench, observed in a judgment dated February 8 released on Tuesday.\n\nThe apex court said the focus was slowly shifting from mere \u201cbetter treatment\u201d or \u201cwell-being\u201d of women to empowering them to be economically independent and self-reliant, with a positive esteem, to enable them to face any situation and participate in development activities.\n\nQuoting Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen, the Supreme Court observed that economic development and women\u2019s empowerment had a symbiotic relationship. One cannot do without the other. The court said the term \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d meant women\u2019s ability to access the constituents of development, in particular health, education, earning opportunities, rights, and political participation.\n\nPoverty and lack of opportunity had bred inequality between men and women, the apex court said. It called for further policy action for women empowerment in order to stimulate economic development.\n\n\u201cPolicy action is still necessary to achieve equality between genders. Such policy action would be unambiguously justified if empowerment of women also stimulates further development, starting a virtual cycle,\u201d the court said.\n\nReal development is only possible with women\u2019s economic empowerment, notes Bench",
