Within hours, he was transported on an Indian Air Force aircraft, accompanied by critical care specialists, to New Delhi.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the hospital on Tuesday, praised \u201cthe endurance & indomitable spirit of Lance Naik Hanumanthappa\u201d, and called him \u201can outstanding soldier.\u201d\n\nDefence Minister Manohar Parrikar extended prayers to \u201cNaik Hanamanthappa who miraculously survived the avalanche at Siachen\u201d.\n\nArmy Chief General Dalbir Singh spoke of the soldier\u2019s indomitable mental robustness and his refusal to give in to the harsh elements.\n\nThe appreciation of the fighting spirit shown by Hanamanthappa came even as several military sources criticised the way the entire top brass rushed in to condole the death of all those who were hit by the avalanche.\n\nAbout 150 soldiers, two rescue dogs \u2014 Dot and Misha \u2014 and some sophisticated radars all were part of the heroic rescue efforts at Siachen since February 3, when an ice wall broke off and fell on the Army post located at 19,500 feet in northern glacier. The debris covered an area of 800 x 1000 metres with a depth of 25 to 30 feet, some of the boulders as big as a small room.\n\nOver 150 soldiers, including specialised rescue teams, began round-the-clock search operation in Siachen, where the day temperature was an average of -30 degrees Celsius and night temperature fell to around -55 degrees Celsius. A medical aid post was also set up.\n\nThe military airlifted rock drills and electrical saws to break the blue ice that is harder than concrete.",
