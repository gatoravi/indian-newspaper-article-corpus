    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday observed that a Chief Minister\u2019s exclusive powers cannot be pre-empted by the Governor, who should use his powers in a fair and limited manner for the sake of survival of democracy.\n\nThe remarks came during a daylong hearing on the Arunachal Pradesh political crisis before a Constitution Bench led by Justice J.S. Khehar, which is also looking into whether there was any relevant material to justify the subsequent imposition of emergency in the State by the President.\n\nAsking whether the Governor had acted on his \u201cwhims\u201d by calling for an Assembly session in December 2015 when the session was scheduled on January 14, 2016, the Bench wondered whether this amount to interference in the functioning of the State\u2019s legislative body.\n\n\u201cThe Governor cannot pre-empt the powers exclusively granted by the Constitution to the Chief Minister and his Council,\u201d the Bench said.",
