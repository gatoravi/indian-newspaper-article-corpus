A guessing game on the worth of his watch is making more noise than issues affecting people.\n\nIt all began with Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy saying in an election rally that Mr. Siddaramaiah, who boasts of his socialist credentials and his government\u2019s pro-poor policies, was wearing a watch worth over Rs. 50 lakh and sunglasses valued at Rs. 2 lakh.\n\nWhile the Chief Minister dismissed this by saying he was ready to \u201csell the watch to anyone for Rs. 10 lakh\u201d and offered it to Mr. Kumaraswamy himself, the issue has refused to die down with the latter on Tuesday saying that he was \u201cnot a trader in second-hand goods.\u201d\n\nHe claimed in Bidar on Tuesday that he had contacted the company that sold the particular brand of watch and it was \u201cvery costly\u201d.",
