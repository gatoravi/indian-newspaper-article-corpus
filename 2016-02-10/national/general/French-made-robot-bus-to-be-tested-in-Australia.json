There will be things that don\u2019t work that we\u2019ll learn from, but it\u2019s all about learning so we\u2019re better prepared for the future,\u201d Mr. Nalder said.\n\nRoyal Automobile Club (RAC) of Western Australia CEO Terry Agnew said the trial, which is being conducted by RAC, would help lawmakers understand the legislative and practical challenges posed by autonomous vehicles.\n\nPublic response\n\n\u201cNot only are we thinking about regulation and how it might work operationally, but importantly we can start understanding the human factor of how Western Australians will embrace and use this innovative technology,\u201d Agnew said.\n\nThe development of self-driving technology has become the latest battleground in the technology market with global automotive manufacturers snapping up software experts in the race to develop a self-driving car for the consumer market. \u2014 IANS",
