    "text": "Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman Ram Sewak Sharma on Tuesday suggested that the government tap alternatives such as cable TV networks to provide digital connectivity, instead of banking on optic fibre cable networks and mobile phones.\n\nThe proposal is important as the rollout of the ambitious National Optic Fibre Network, rebranded as BharatNet by the NDA government, is mired in delays. The lack of adequate connectivity could undermine the potential advantages from transformational programmes like Aadhaar that gave people a digital identity proof authenticated online in real time, Mr. Sharma told the India Digital summit here. \u201cIt would be a pity if connectivity doesn\u2019t support the applications of tomorrow\u2019s system,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile India had a billion mobile phones, Mr. Sharma said that digital transactions were not possible unless connectivity improved.\n\n\u201cPipelines need to be made thicker and we should explore alternative models for connectivity besides mobiles,\u201d Mr. Sharma said.\n\nTRAI has recently recommended that the government adopt a public private partnership model to expedite the implementation of the BharatNet project. \u201cA PPP model with states as partners may help quicker deployment,\u201d Mr Sharma said, but added there\u2019s a \u2018big if\u2019 on its accelerated implementation.\n\n\u201cCan we use cable TV networks to connect? Technologically, it is possible though they may need an upgrade. There are 100 million homes with cable TV and those pipes can deliver upto 10 Mb per second speeds with assured connectivity,\u201d Mr Sharma pointed out. Assuming 5 persons per household, the telecom regulator said that would connect 50 crore people to the internet and reduce the load on wireless spectrum.",
