    "text": "Legal experts express concern at precedent this sets for safety of women at workplace\n\nAfter The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) announced on Monday that R.K. Pachauri, under investigation in a sexual harassment case, has been appointed its Executive Vice-Chairman, legal experts termed the move illegal, expressing concerns about the precedent this sets for safety of women at the workplace.\n\nMr. Pachauri, who is out on bail, was appointed to this position, which was created to accommodate him.\n\nEminent lawyer Vrinda Grover said this appointment was in gross violation of the spirit of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 that builds on the foundation laid down by the Vishakha judgment of the Supreme Court in 1997. As per the new law, sexual harassment at workplace is a crime, which places multiple obligations on the employer, first and foremost being an impartial and fair enquiry. She said the woman complainant in this case was denied that, as the Internal Complaints Committee which found Mr. Pachauri guilty was dissolved and its findings were not acted upon.\n\n\u201cWith pending investigation, the TERI management should not have compelled the woman complainant to resign,\u201d Ms. Grover said.\n\nMr. Pachauri, on the other hand, continues to be Chancellor of the deemed university of TERI. With the current appointment, he will continue to hold executive powers in the organisation.\n\nMs. Grover said that under the new law, all workplaces were obliged to provide a safe workplace for women.",
