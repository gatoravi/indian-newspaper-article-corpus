He had heard that Brigadier Riyaz, a serving ISI officer, was another handler of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi.\n\nHeadley said he came to Mumbai in September 2006. He first stayed at the Taj and then moved to Oberoi. Later, he stayed as a paying guest in a house near Breach Candy Hospital. He returned to visit Taj Hotel in April 2007 with his wife Faiza and conducted surveillance of the hotel several times.\n\nHeadley said the LeT and the ISI worked closely with each other and gave military, financial and moral support to the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. He met Maulana Mazoor Azhar, head of the JeM, at a gathering in October 2003 organised by the LeT where he was the guest speaker.\n\nWhen special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam asked Headley where he went after visiting Mumbai, he said he visited the UAE to invest his money in properties.\n\nThe deposition will continue on Wednesday morning.",
