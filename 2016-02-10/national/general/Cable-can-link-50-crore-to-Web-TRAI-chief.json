    "text": "The ambitious National Optic Fibre Network, rebranded as BharatNet by the NDA government, aims to provide broadband connectivity to 2.5 lakh village panchayats at a cost of Rs. 1,09,000 crore.\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman Ram Sewak Sharma\u2019s suggestion to the government to consider alternatives for providing digital connectivity was first made to the government a couple of months ago.\n\nTRAI had recently recommended that the government adopt a public private partnership model to expedite the implementation of the BharatNet project. \u201cA PPP model with States as partners may help quicker deployment,\u201d Mr. Sharma told the India Digital Summit here on Tuesday, but added there was a \u2018big if\u2019 on its accelerated implementation.\n\n\u201cCan we use cable TV networks to connect? Technologically, it is possible though they may need an upgrade. There are 100 million homes with cable TV and those pipes can deliver up to 10 Mb per second speeds with assured connectivity,\u201d he said.\n\nAssuming 5 persons per household, that would connect 50 crore people to the Internet and reduce the load on wireless spectrum. \u201cWe have recommended this to the government a couple of months ago and reiterated it again,\u201d he said, adding the regulator was working with the telecom department on the issue.\n\nCiting the example of developed markets like the U.S., he said most households used fixed line or cable TV Internet services at home. \u201cAt home, you don\u2019t need to use wireless mobile connectivity,\u201d Mr. Sharma said.",
