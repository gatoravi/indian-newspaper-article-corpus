Within a couple of months, we expect to submit the preliminary report to the government,\u201d said Kishore Raykar, director of the agency.\n\nHe told The Hindu that the same agency has been working in Bidar since 2013 for the restoration of the Karez system there.\n\n\u201cThe work in Bidar gave us an insight into the magnificent ancient water system that existed centuries ago, and still can be restored with the help of the government,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Raykar said that in Vijayapura, the agency was working since December 15 for mapping and preparing a report with the assistance of experts from IIT Hyderabad and landscape designers.\n\nThe Karez experts of Iran would be visiting the city in March to suggest how the system could be restored.\n\nHe said Iran had over 36,000 Karez to supply water and it has constituted a separate Ministry to maintain it.",
