The Mysuru zoo has surplus deer and has offered to spare over two dozen of them for display at the night safari.\n\nConservator of Forest and Zoo, Executive Director S. Venkatesan, told The Hindu that he had received a communication from the Singapore zoo asking if there were spotted deer to spare for the night safari. \u201cWe agreed to give them the animals as we have a surplus (about 150). The deer will be given under an exchange programme,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Venkatesan said the Mysuru zoo had asked for a female chimpanzee from Singapore\u2019s collection since the zoo lacks female chimps following the recent death of chimp Mirella. \u201cWe are awaiting a response from Singapore. If we get a female chimp, it will help in captive breeding.\u201d\n\nThe Mysuru and Singapore zoos share a good rapport and two animal exchanges have already taken place between them in the past.\n\nThe animals will be given under an exchange programme,\n\nsays official",
