    "text": "Ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls due next year, circulation of unattributed pamphlets and messages on social media, pairing Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party with the Khalistan movement spearhead Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, has caused disquiet. The political parties are blaming one another.\n\nA recent poster carrying the photo of Bhindranwale, along with Mr. Kejriwal and senior Punjab leaders of the AAP, is doing the rounds on social media. The message in Punjabi says: \u201cOn February 12, the AAP will observe the birth anniversary of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. On this day, all party workers should visit the nearest Gurdwaras and pledge to walk the path shown by Sants.\u201d\n\nIt further says the poster was issued by the AAP, Punjab, and \u201cBhindranwale, a lion. We will fulfil your dream,\u201d\n\nThe AAP has denied releasing any such poster. It has accused its opponents of trying to defame and weaken the party.\n\nThe BJP has wondered why the AAP leadership did not file an FIR, if it did not release the poster.\n\nThe Congress has also accused the AAP of resorting to disruptive tactics for short-term political gains.",
