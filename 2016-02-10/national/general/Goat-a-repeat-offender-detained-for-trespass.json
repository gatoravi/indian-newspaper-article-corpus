    "text": "Incredible as it may sound, a goat was taken into custody by police in Chattisgarh on a trespass complaint.\n\nThe goat, accused of being a \u2018repeat offender\u2019, was released later but its owner was not so lucky. Abdul Hasan (40) was arrested after his goat allegedly ventured into the garden of a judge\u2019s bungalow in Korea district, police said on Tuesday, as the incident gave fodder to the opposition Congress to slam the State police. The goat had many times raided into the garden of the Judge Ratre\u2019s bungalow, in Janakpur town, about 350 km from Raipur, and ate flowers and plants there, police said. \u2014 PTI",
