However, several supporters of Guru reposted the drawing in protest.\n\n\u201cIt [the cartoon] got deleted from Facebook on Tuesday morning with a message \u2018We removed something you posted\u2019 with the image of the post with the Guru cartoon. FB has also blocked me from posting new cartoons on the page,\u201d said Mr. Suhail, a cartoonist with the daily newspaper Rising Kashmir .\n\nWhile Facebook said \u201cit was looking into the matter\u201d, netizens trolled the social networking site.\n\n\u201cThe cartoon by Mir Suhail was removed by Facebook just after an hour of publishing it on his official Facebook page. This time to satisfy the \u2018collective conscience\u2019 of a certain class or community of netizens. Share it, make it #\u00fdViral (sic),\u201d so went a post.\n\nOn February 9, 2013, Guru was hanged in Tihar Jail for his role in the Parliament attack. His son, Ghalib Guru, reiterated his plea, requesting authorities in New Delhi \u201cto return the belongings of Guru.\u201d",
