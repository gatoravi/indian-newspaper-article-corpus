Scientists have developed a robot that simulates their flexibility.\u2014 Photo: Reuters/UC Berkeley\n\nInspired by cockroaches that can squeeze through tiny spaces, U.S. scientists have designed a small robot that may one day help locate people in the rubble of earthquakes, tornadoes or explosions.\n\nThe technology by the University of California, Berkeley was unveiled on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . \u201cWhat\u2019s impressive about these cockroaches is that they can run as fast through a quarter-inch gap as a half-inch gap, by reorienting their legs completely out to the side,\u201d said lead researcher Kaushik Jayaram, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. \u201cThey\u2019re about half an inch tall when they run freely, but can squish their bodies to one-tenth of an inch \u2014 the height of two stacked pennies.\u201d\n\nThe palm-sized robot, known as CRAM \u2014 for compressible robot with articulated mechanisms \u2014 is capped with a plastic shield, much like the wings on the back of a cockroach.\n\nUsing a specially built obstacle course, the researchers observed how cockroaches scurried in less than a second through crevices smaller than a quarter of their height by compressing their jointed exoskeletons in half.\n\nOnce inside the crevice, the cockroaches managed to move rapidly, at nearly 20 body lengths per second, with their legs splayed completely out to their sides.\n\n\u201cIf you scale it up to the size of a human, it would be equivalent to about 70 miles per hour (113 kph), over twice the speed of the fastest sprinter,\u201d Mr. Jayaram said.\n\n\u201cIn the event of an earthquake, first responders need to know if an area of rubble is stable and safe, but the challenge is, most robots can\u2019t get into rubble,\u201d said Robert Full, a professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley.\n\n\u201cBut if there are lots of cracks and vents and conduits, you can imagine just throwing a swarm of these robots in to locate survivors and safe entry points for first responders.\u201d\n\nResearchers say their robots are inexpensive to make, and they are working on various versions for real-world testing.\n\nFunding for the research has come from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, as part of a collaboration between industry and university partners. \u2014 AFP/ Reuters\n\nNature has a library of design ideas. ...The most important discoveries are often from the most unexpected creatures, some of which are disgusting.",
