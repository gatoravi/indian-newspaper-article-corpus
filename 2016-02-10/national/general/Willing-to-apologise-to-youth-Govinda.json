    "text": "Actor Govinda on Tuesday conveyed to the Supreme Court his willingness to offer an unconditional apology and compensation to a youth he is shown slapping in a video shot seven years ago.\n\nHowever, a Bench of Justices V. Gopala Gowda and U.U. Lalit sought the actor\u2019s response to a submission by the victim\u2019s lawyer that Govinda did not personally apologise to his client. \u201cWhat did we tell you at the last hearing? We had asked you to meet him and sort it out. Whatever you want to offer, tell him personally and don\u2019t give it to us,\u201d the Bench told Govinda\u2019s lawyers in court.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in November last year, had advised the former politician and Bollywood star to let bygones be bygones and settle with the man who accused the star of slapping him in 2008.\n\nThe apex court said it would not tolerate the actor slapping anybody in public. The actor need not replicate in real life his action scenes in the movies, it said.",
