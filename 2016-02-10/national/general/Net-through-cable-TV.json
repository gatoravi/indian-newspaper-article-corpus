    "text": "Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman Ram Sewak Sharma has suggested that the government tap alternatives such as cable TV networks to provide digital connectivity, instead of banking on optic fibre cable networks and mobile phones.\n\nThe proposal is important as the rollout of the ambitious National Optic Fibre Network, rebranded as BharatNet by the NDA government, is mired in delays. The optic fibre network aims to provide broadband connectivity to 2.5 lakh village panchayats at a cost of Rs 109,000 crore.\n\nThe lack of adequate connectivity could undermine the potential advantages from transformational programs like Aadhaar that gives people a digital identity proof that can be authenticated online in real-time, Mr Sharma added. \u201cIt would be a pity if connectivity doesn\u2019t support the applications of tomorrow\u2019s system,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile India has a billion mobile phones, Mr Sharma said that digital transactions are not possible unless connectivity improves.\n\n\u201cPipelines need to be made thicker and we should explore alternative models for connectivity besides mobiles. We have been brainstorming over this,\u201d Mr Sharma said at the India Digital summit in the capital.\n\nTRAI has recently recommended that the government adopt a public private partnership model to expedite the implementation of the BharatNet project. \u201cA PPP model with states as partners may help quicker deployment,\u201d Mr Sharma said.",
