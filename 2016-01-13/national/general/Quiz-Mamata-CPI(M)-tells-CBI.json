    "text": "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leadership said it would target West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the Saradha scam ahead of the 2016 Assembly polls.\n\nAt a Left Front protest demonstration held on Tuesday near the CBI regional office at Salt Lake here, the CPI(M) demanded that the agency issue a notice to the Chief Minister. It said only a Left Front government could return the money of duped investors who lost their savings in the Saradha scam.\n\nAccusing the CBI of beating around the bush in probing the Saradha scam, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra urged the agency to nab the \u201cmain culprit\u201d behind the scam and interrogate the Chief Minister in the process.\n\n\u201cWe are putting the CBI on notice to issue summons to the Chief Minister. We dare the CM to come clear on whether she was present at the meeting at Kalimpong [with Saradha Group owner Sudipta Sen before he fled the State],\u201d said Dr. Mishra.\n\nDig at Jaitley\n\nHe took a dig at Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for doing \u201cprecious little\u201d in taking action against illegal ponzi scheme owners and dared him to file a \u201cdefamation suit\u201d against him as he did against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.",
