I expect the coalition to form the government soon after the State mourning ends tomorrow [Wednesday],\u201d Mr. Beg told the media in Srinagar in the morning.\n\nHowever, immediately after this statement, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti directed the party leaders \u201cto wait for her statement\u201d, said party sources.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , PDP legislator Nayeem Akhtar said no time frame could be firmed up. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the date but about the state of mind. Please respect Mehbooba ji \u2019s right to privacy at this point in time. There is no timeline finalised so far. Mehbooba ji will take the final call and we all will wait for her,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Akhtar said there was no internal discussion on the government formation so far. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even approached her [Mehbooba] and she has no time to receive suggestions from party colleagues. The process is yet to start,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Jammu, BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, a key player in the BJP-PDP alliance presided over a meeting of BJP legislators, the first since Governor\u2019s rule was announced.\n\nThe meeting was held at the residence of Nirmal Singh, who was a Deputy CM in the PDP-BJP Cabinet.\n\n\u201cLet the PDP reveal its cards first. We will respond accordingly,\u201d said BJP in-charge of Kashmir affairs Avinash Rai Khanna. BJP State president Sat Sharma added that \u201ca government will be formed soon. There are no issues as such.\u201d\n\nSources said most BJP legislators stressed the need to have a government in place quickly. There was also unanimity on Ms. Mufti taking over as Chief Minister.",
