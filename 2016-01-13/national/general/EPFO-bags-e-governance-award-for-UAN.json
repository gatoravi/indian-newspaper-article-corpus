The EPFO won the gold award in the \u2018innovative use of technology in e-governance\u2019 category and the retirement body will get a cash prize of Rs. 2 lakh.\n\n\u201cIt is heartening to know that the e-initiatives of EPFO are getting recognised by the Union government as well. Our ultimate goal is to deliver services as smooth as an e-bank,\u201d said K.K. Jalan, Central Provident Fund Commissioner at the EPFO.\n\nThe award will be presented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to the EPFO at the 19th National Conference on e-governance to be held in Nagpur on January 22. Through UAN, active employees are provided a universal number which can be linked to various provident fund account numbers provided to them while working in different organisations. A single account number can be used through all of workers\u2019 employments with various organisations. Earlier, the worker had to apply for transfer of funds on change of job.",
