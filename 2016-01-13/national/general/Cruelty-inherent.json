Venugopal, fought for the cause of protecting the bulls pro bono .\n\n\u201cI would like to know how many lawyers representing the culture and tradition of Tamil Nadu gave up their sitting fee to fight the case,\u201d vice-chairman of the Board, Chinny Krishna asked.\n\nThe Board members are appointed for three years and there is provision for six MPs from the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha.\n\nMr. Krishna said any move to terminate their service would be contested if it was mala fide.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a batch of petitions moved by the Board seeking to quash the January 7 notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests allowing jallikattu.\n\nMr. Krishna pointed out that the notification violated several provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.\n\nCruelty is inherent in jallikattu, he asserted.\n\n\u201cI am from Tamil Nadu, but my culture does not include cruelty to animals. As a statutory body, it was our responsibility to show that the Centre was wrong,\u201d he said.",
