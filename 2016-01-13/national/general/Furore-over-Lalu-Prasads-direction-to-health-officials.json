    "text": "Lalu Prasad, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief and coalition partner in Bihar, is once again caught in a controversy with an official letter mentioning his directions to government health officials and doctors. The Opposition has charged Mr. Prasad with being a \u201cSuper Chief Minister\u201d in the government headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, issuing \u201cunconstitutional and extra constitutional\u201d instructions.\n\nA January 11, 2016, letter from the Civil Surgeon of Darbhanga, Sriram Singh, to the Superintendent of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), mentions Mr Prasad as seeking the reinstatement of the Mamata health workers who were terminated. Mamata health workers are trained workers on contract, deputed at maternity wards of government hospitals. They are paid between Rs. 1,000 to Rs 3,000 per month.\n\nIn his letter, the Darbhanga CS has asked the DMCH Superintendent to take action on Mr. Prasad\u2019s inquiries, made over the telephone, and apprise him of the follow-up \u201cso that he could inform Mr Prasad about the action taken on it\u201d. Mr. Singh also forwarded the letter to the Darbhanga District Magistrate, the State Health Director and the RJD chief.\n\nAsked about the official letter mentioning his name, the RJD chief told journalists: \u201cYes, I\u2019d made the call and asked the officials why Mamata health workers were being removed from their jobs\u2026They\u2019re from lower castes and had met me with the request\u2026When someone comes to meet me, should I throw them out?\u201d\n\nIn defence\n\nMr. Prasad\u2019s younger son, Tejaswi Yadav, who is also Deputy CM of the state, said: \u201cHe (Lalu Prasad) is leader of our party which is in government so he does this social work by meeting people \u2026even the State BJP leaders were earlier inspecting railway projects.\u201d\n\nJD(U) leader and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar also defended Mr Prasad and said there was nothing wrong in his intervention as the BJP leaders too had done such things earlier.\n\nOn January 3, Mr Prasad, whose elder son Tej Pratap is the State Health Minister, made a surprise inspection of a government hospital, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), and is said to have instructed hospital officials and doctors.\n\nHowever, Opposition parties again charged Mr Prasad with acting like a \u201cSuper CM\u201d . \u201cThis letter has proved once again that there are two CMs in Bihar today and Lalu Prasad ji is Super CM. If not, in what capacity has he been giving directions and instructions to the government officials?\u201d asked State BJP leader Binod Narayan Jha.\n\n\u201cWhy is Nitish Kumar keeping mum over all this unconstitutional and extra-constitutional actions in the affairs of governance? Nitish Kumar should either resign or ask his officials not to follow Lalu Prasad\u2019s directions,\u201d said Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Chief Minister and chief of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular).\n\nYes, I asked why workers were being removed from their jobs: RJD chief",
