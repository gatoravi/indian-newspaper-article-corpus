    "text": "The Bahujan Samaj Party on Tuesday dismissed a post-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe party said it would prefer to stay in the Opposition than form a government with the BJP in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is no scope of that by a far stretch. No pre-poll or post-poll alliance with the BJP. We are confident of coming to power with a full majority,\u201d Leader of Opposition in the U.P. Assembly, Swami Prasad Maurya told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cWe have seen the khooni chera [bloody side] of the BJP... If we fail to reach the majority mark, we will prefer to stay in the Opposition rather than join hands with the BJP,\u201d the senior BSP leader said in an interview ahead of party supremo Mayawati\u2019s 60th birthday celebrations.\n\nAt a time when the Ram Mandir Ayodhya issue is gaining heat, Mr. Maurya\u2019s words assume significance as it would allay the fear among Muslims. A section of the community has been suspicious of the BSP as it has allied with the BJP thrice in the past. Ms. Mayawati is hoping for a consolidation of her core Dalit voters, with poor upper castes and Muslims.",
