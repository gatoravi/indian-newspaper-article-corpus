    "text": "Road, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday strongly denied the graft charges levied by the Congress in awarding the Zojila Pass tunnel project in Jammu and Kashmir to the Mumbai-based IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd. \u201cIt is stated that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways follows due procedure while maintaining complete transparency in the award of any contracts. In the instant case also, the contract was awarded after due diligence after the bid was found technically responsive,\u201d Mr.Gadkari said.\n\nOn Monday, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh alleged that Mr.Gadkari had indulged in \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d to hand over a contract of constructing the Zojila Pass Tunnel worth Rs.1,050 crore and further alleged that Mr.Gadkari\u2019s son, Nikhil Gadkari, had been a shareholder of Ideal Energy, a subsidiary of IRB Infrastructure Developers.\n\nHe further alleged companies that had initially shown interest to build the tunnel ended up withdrawing their tenders as they were \u201cgiven specific signals to withdraw or face consequences in other projects.\u201d\n\nIn a detailed explanation, Mr.Gadkari described the bidding history of the project starting from the time the technical bid was first opened in 2013. He said only one developer had bid for the project on two occasions earlier, leading to the cancellation of the bidding process. Based on these experiences, the government had to subsequently change the bidding process.\n\nFrom a two-stage procedure, wherein both request for quotation , or technical bid, and request for proposal , or financial bid were invited, a single stage process of inviting the RFP was followed.",
