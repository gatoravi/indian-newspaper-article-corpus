They were educated and well prepared and had intelligence. They fought us and only by Allah\u2019s grace were we able to control them and eliminate them,\u201d Mr. Sadat was quoted as saying by Tolo News.\n\nThe police official said efforts were under way to track down, identify and detain those who assisted the attackers to gain access to the building that was opposite the Indian Consulate.\n\nAn intense gun battle between the security forces and the attackers took place outside the Indian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif after assailants attempted to storm the mission building on Jan. 3.\n\nThe standoff ended on the night of January 4 after the attackers, who entered the building opposite the Indian Consulate, were killed.\n\nOne police man also lost his life and nine others including three civilians were wounded in the incident.\n\nAs the Consulate came under attack, Indo-Tibetan Border Police guards deployed on the sentry post foiled their attempt by raining heavy fire on them. \u2014 PTI",
