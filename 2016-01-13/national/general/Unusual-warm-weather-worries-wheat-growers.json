After cotton crop failure and losses due to basmati rice price crash in the last kharif season, we were pinning our hopes on a good harvest from wheat, but it looks like the crop could fail and our miseries will continue,\u201d said Mr. Bains.\n\nMinimum temperatures have been hovering above 2 to 4 degree Celsius above normal at many places in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana during the past few days and are expected to continue to be a little higher than usual for the next few days, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\n\n\u201cIt will be mostly dry weather prevailing during the next 7 to 10 days across the northern region and parts of central Indian States,\u201d said B.P Yadav, weather official at IMD.\n\nYield may be hit\n\n\u201cCurrently temperatures are on the higher side and wheat needs cold conditions to thrive. It\u2019s a crucial period for the crop and if temperatures continue to remain high there would be definitely a yield loss,\u201d said P.S Rangi, agriculture expert, adding that rain was also required at this moment.",
