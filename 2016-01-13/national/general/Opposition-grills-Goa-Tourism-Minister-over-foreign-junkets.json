The amount spent must be more than Rs. 19 crore,\u201d former Chief Minister Digambar Kamat told the Assembly, quoting statistics from Mr. Parulekar\u2019s reply.\n\nQuestioning the logic behind conducting official visits to Los Angeles, New York, Japan, Washington, Australia, New Zealand, and Nepal, Mr. Kamat asked Mr. Parulekar how many tourists from these countries had visited Goa. The Minister could not provide the answer.\n\nMr. Kamat also pointed out that even officials from the Water Resources Ministry had joined tourism officials on foreign tours.\n\nDefending the junkets, Mr. Parulekar said the previous Congress-led coalition government headed by Mr. Kamat too had sanctioned foreign tours of the Tourism Ministry.",
