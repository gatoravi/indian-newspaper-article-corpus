    "text": "External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will start a big season of Israel-Arab League diplomacy when she lands in Israel on January 16.\n\nFrom Israel, Ms. Swaraj is scheduled to leave for Ramallah for the first official visit by her to the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority on the morning of January 17. She is expected to return same day to continue discussions with Israeli leaders. However, what is drawing attention of policymakers in South Block is that within two days of her Israel trip, Ms. Swaraj will fly out to Bahrain to attend the India-Arab League meeting of Foreign Ministers, on January 23-24, to assess the fallout of Iran-Saudi hostilities on India.\n\n\u201cIn the next 12 days, apart from the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the External Affairs Minister is scheduled to meet all 22 Foreign Ministers of the Arab League, which is significant since the Arab League is favouring Saudi Arabia in its tense confrontation with Iran,\u201d a senior diplomatic source told The Hindu .\n\nThe Hindu has reliably learnt that though the visit to Israel was expected, it probably was synergised with Saudi Arabia\u2019s requests for deeper consultation with India, which finally will lead to back-to-back discussions with Israel and the member countries of the Arab League which is dominated by the Gulf Cooperation Council led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, as The Hindu had earlier reported, Ms. Swaraj will also work on exchange of VVIP visits with the West Asian and the Gulf regions during her trips. It is expected that she will lay the ground work for an India visit by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sources also said Ms. Swaraj will begin groundwork for a big ticket visit to Saudi Arabia shortly, during her trip to Bahrain.",
