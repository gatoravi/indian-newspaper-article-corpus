    "text": "A rare collection of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays claimed to have been published in 1623 was handed over to the treasure trove of the National Archives of India, Record Centre, Puducherry by N. Nandhivarman, Tamil researcher, litterateur and activist.\n\nThe uniqueness of the collection relates to its age and the set of illustrations not common in other Shakespeare editions.\n\nThe National Archives of India, Puducherry, will house this rare edition for the researchers to peruse the collection.\n\nMr. Nandhivarman said, \u201cThree volumes of the plays have no mention of the year of publication as the front pages were attacked by termites. Later, the books were repaired and rebound. Originally it was presented to me by M.T. Black, president of Mann Marbles Limited, Isles of Man in 1988. I was a granite exporter at that time and was his representative in India to certify the quality of other exporter\u2019s products. He entrusted the literary treasure with me fearing that after his time, there would be none in the family to preserve it. He told me that it was a 1623 edition, I remember.\u201d\n\nArchivist M. Murugesan said: \u201cWe will preserve the collection for research. First, we will give fumigation treatment. Anyone can access them from National Archives of India.\u201d",
