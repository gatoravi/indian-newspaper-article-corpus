It has been particularly critical of what it calls the government\u2019s \u201cconfused response\u201d to the Pathankot attack.\n\n\u201cThe way Pakistan is reacting is standard tactics that the Pakistani state has always adopted. It\u2019s getting worse because the government here is in a dilemma; we don\u2019t know what the next step is going to be,\u201d Congress leader Sachin Pilot told The Hindu , calling for more \u201cstringent action.\u201d\n\nThe government made no official comment on the Foreign Secretary talks that had been informally scheduled for January 15, but hasn\u2019t been cancelled either. A final decision will only be taken on Mr. Jaishankar\u2019s return from Sri Lanka on Wednesday, officials said.",
