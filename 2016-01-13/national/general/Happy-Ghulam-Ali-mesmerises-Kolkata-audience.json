Even though Ghulam Ali\u2019s son Aamir Ali was to perform before him, the ghazal maestro took the stage first and mesmerised the audience.\n\nMs. Banerjee used the opportunity, which coincided with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, to emphasise religious tolerance.\n\n\u201cMusic has no boundaries. Swamiji used to say that our religion is for the world, it encompasses all, takes everyone in its fold, loves the humanity and it\u2019s the cradle of civilisation and culture.\u201d\n\nPointing out that Swami Vivekananda spoke about tolerance Ms. Banerjee said: \u201cwithout tolerance this world cannot exist.\u201d",
