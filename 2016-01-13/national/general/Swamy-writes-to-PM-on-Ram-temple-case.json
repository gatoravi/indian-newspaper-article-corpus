    "text": "BJP leader Subramanian Swamy wants the government to approach the Supreme Court seeking a day-to-day hearing of the pending civil appeals on the ownership of the disputed site in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque once stood.\n\nThe appeals are against the verdict of the Allahabad HC on the Ayodhya title suit. \u201cI feel that it is appropriate that our government, especially its Law Officers, approach the Supreme Court with an application seeking day-to-day hearing on the Ram Janmabhoomi issues and pray that the Supreme Court gives its verdict on Civil Appeals as early as possible,\u201d Dr. Swamy says in his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the VHP has also been making a pitch for expediting the process for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.",
