Moms\u2019 and dads\u2019 mobile phones have become their lifeline to managing schedules, keeping tabs on teens and sharing their kids\u2019 key milestones,\u201d Facebook IQ said in a blog post.\n\n\u201cBy observing behaviour on Facebook, we see that parents over-index on mobile usage. In fact, parents globally spend 1.3 times more time on Facebook mobile than non-parents,\u201d the blog added. Millennial parents (ages 18-34), were 30 per cent more likely than Boomer parents (ages 50-65) to use their mobile devices to make more informed purchasing decisions, the study found.\n\nAs many as 83 per cent of the parents surveyed said they have access to more information than their parents did. \u2014 PTI",
