Information about this must be propagated in the Army. We have given instructions about such dangers,\u201d Mr. Parikkar said.\n\n\u201cIf the Commanding Officer of a unit is alert then such cases can be noticed, so we\u2019ve given instructions that the alertness must be increased,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pain that my country and I have borne must be returned to the attackers,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said, while speaking on the recent attack on the Pathankot airbase.\n\nClarifying that it was his personal opinion, Mr. Parrikar said, \u201cI have lost seven of my men [in the Pathankot attack]. We [the agencies concerned] are aware of what is required to be done. You must keep your trust [in us] and you shall see the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall see to it that such incidents [like Pathankot] must not happen again. We, as a country, cannot bear [such attacks] anymore. The ability of the country to bear [such attacks] is over,\u201d he said. Among the actions to be taken as \u201clessons from the Pathankot attack\u201d are the primary and security audits of the airbase and military stations.",
