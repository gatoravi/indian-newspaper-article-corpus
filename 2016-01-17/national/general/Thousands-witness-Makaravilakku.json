Rooftops of various buildings as well as the hillsides facing the east and the grasslands in the Sabarimala forests had been occupied by the devotees for the past two days.\n\nTemple Tantri and Melsanthi performed Makarasankrama puja at 1.27 a.m. on Friday. The ghee brought from the Kowdiar Palace in Thiruvananthapuram was offered to the presiding deity as part of the puja.\n\nThe procession carrying Thiruvabharanam, golden attire, reached the holy hillock around 6.30 p.m. Travancore Devaswom Board president Prayar Gopalakrishnan accompanied the procession that set off from Pandalam on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Ayyappa idol was decorated with the golden attire. The entire Sannidhanam was in a pensive mood for the next few minutes before the opening of the sanctum sanctorum for deeparadhana.\n\nThe Makaravilakku deeparadhana was performed atop the Ponnambalamedu hill by 6.42 p.m. and the bright flame flickered thrice atop the Ponnamabalamedu, taking the sacred grove to a divine frenzy.\n\nA large number of pilgrims had assembled at Pullumedu, Panchalimedu, Parunthumpara, and Attathode from where they could worship the Makaravilakku deepar- adhana.\n\nThere was a heavy rush of devotees descending the holy hillock immediately after the deeparadhana.",
