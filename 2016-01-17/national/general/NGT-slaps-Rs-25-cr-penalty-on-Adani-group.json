Such irresponsible attitude must be deprecated.\u201d\n\nAccording to the bench of Justice V.R. Kingaonkar, the respondent AHPPL is liable to pay Rs.25 crore as penalty for restoration. It also restrained the company from closing or narrowing the mouth of the creek or access of the boats of the traditional fishermen in the village.\n\nThe Adani group refused to comment on the NGT\u2019s order.\n\nEnvironmental clearance for its port project in Hazira, south Gujarat, quashed",
