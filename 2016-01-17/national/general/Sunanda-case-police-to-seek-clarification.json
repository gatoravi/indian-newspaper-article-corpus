    "text": "The Delhi Police\u2019s Special Investigation Team (SIT) is marking all \u201cambiguous\u201d portions in the All India Institute of Medical Science report on Sunanda Pushkar\u2019s death in the hope of getting more clarity.\n\nA highly-placed police source said the \u201cambiguous\u201d portions of the report will be sent back to AIIMS for further clarification. This is set to delay the ongoing investigation by nearly three months.\n\nPolice Commissioner B.S. Bassi had taken to Twitter on Friday to reveal that the police had received the report of AIIMS findings on the FBI\u2019s forensic report on the Sunanda\u2019s visceral samples. She had died under mysterious circumstances in January two years ago. Speaking to the journalists later, Mr. Bassi had said while Sunanda\u2019s death was unnatural, there was uncertainty on the poisonous substance that killed her. The United States-based FBI lab report had ruled out polonium or any other radioactive poisoning substances as the cause of death.\n\nSince the FBI reports were \u201cinconclusive\u201d, the police had sent them to the AIIMS forensic experts to analyse if any of the chemicals mentioned in the FBI report caused Pushkar\u2019s death.\n\nHowever, as there are lot of \u201ctechnical points\u201d which are beyond the police\u2019s understanding, the AIIMS report has failed to help the investigators, prompting them to plan to return the report to AIIMS for clarifications.",
