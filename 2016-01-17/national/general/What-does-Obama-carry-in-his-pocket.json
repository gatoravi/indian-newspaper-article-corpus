He says that helps him cope on a bad day \u201cbecause somebody gave me this privilege to work on these issues that are going to affect them.\u201d\n\nThe upshot \u2014 Mr. Obama realises \u201cI better get back to work.\u201d\n\nThe president made the revelation on Friday during separate interviews with three YouTube personalities. One of his interviewers had asked ahead of time for Mr. Obama to bring a meaningful item and talk about it.\n\nWhen asked, Mr. Obama pulled quite an assortment from his right pants pocket \u2014 rosary beads from Pope Francis, a tiny Buddha, a metal poker chip he said came from a bald biker with a handlebar moustache he met in Iowa in 2007, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia and a Hindu statuette of the monkey god Hanuman.\n\nMr. Obama has too many of the mementoes to carry all of them around \u201cbut I\u2019ll pick out a few things...to remind me of all the people I\u2019ve met along the way and the stories they told me,\u201d he told Ingrid Nilsen of Los Angeles. She\u2019s known as \u2018Missglamorazzi\u2019 on the video sharing website.\n\nThe interviews were part of a continuing White House strategy to reach different audiences and keep alive discussion of themes from Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nMr. Obama was also questioned by Adande Thorne, a video game enthusiast from Orlando, Florida, known online as \u2018sWooZie\u2019, and Destin Sandlin, an Alabaman who is into science and makes educational videos.\n\nMr. Sandlin, who said he holds a civilian job at the Department of Defence, asked Mr. Obama to describe the characteristics of \u2018Obamium\u2019, a hypothetical element named after him.\n\n\u201cI would want it to be stable,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI would want it to be a catalyst, but one that didn\u2019t get too hot or too cold, and hopefully, it would be one that was useful to humanity, that we could actually use and wasn\u2019t just some shiny object,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Obama said his favourite movie last year was The Martian , starring Matt Damon. He has not seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens .\n\nAsked by \u2018sWooZie\u2019 who would emerge victorious if musicians Drake and Kendrick Lamar faced off in a rap battle, Mr. Obama chose Lamar. He said Drake is an \u201coutstanding entertainer,\u201d but that Lamar had the best album last year, titled To Pimp a Butterfly . Last year, Obama praised Lamar\u2019s song, How Much a Dollar Cost . \u2014 AP\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick out a few things...to remind me of all the people I\u2019ve met along the way\u201d",
