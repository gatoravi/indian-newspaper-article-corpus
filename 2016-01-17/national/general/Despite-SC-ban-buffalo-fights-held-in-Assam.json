However, some buffalo keepers organised a token match.\n\nIn view of a Supreme Court ban, the traditional buffalo fight on the occasion of Magh Bihu organised by the Ahotguri Buffalo Fight Organising Committee, was not held in Morigaon district.\n\nToken fight\n\nIn the token fight, the organisers ensured that no animal was hurt, a district official said. No action was taken against the keepers as it was only a token fight and no official complaint was received against them, the official said.\n\nThe Gauhati High Court recently banned another traditional event held during the Magh Bihu festival responding to pleas that they were cruel to bulbuli birds.\n\nOn January 12, the High Court after hearing an application filed by the Animal Welfare Board of India, passed an order banning the traditional bulbuli bird fight at the Hayagrib Madhab Mandir in Hajo in Assam after considering various provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and he Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. \u2014 PTI",
