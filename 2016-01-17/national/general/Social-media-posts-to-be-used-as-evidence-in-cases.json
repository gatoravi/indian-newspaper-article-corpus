The importance of legal cooperation with West Asian countries was highlighted as India received excellent cooperation from the UAE regarding the arrest of Afsha Jabeen, who was deported here and arrested for propagating and recruiting young men on behalf of the IS.\n\n\u201cThe influence of the IS in the Khorasan province of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region was a cause of concern; so was its influence in Bangladesh, with which we share a porous border. We have an open visa regime with the Maldives, a country where many youngsters have travelled to Syria to join the IS. It was felt that a careful watch must be kept on young Indians, particularly from the southern States who travel there for work,\u201d a senior government official said.\n\nMr. Singh held the meeting to review the situation arising out of some Indian youths getting attracted towards the IS and how to deal with the emerging challenge.",
