    "text": "Indrani Mukerjea accepted that she had informed her husband Peter Mukerjea about her daughter Sheena Bora\u2019s murder, read the Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) reply submitted to a local court on Saturday.\n\nThe CBI opposed Mr Mukerjea\u2019s bail application in connection with the killing of Sheena, whose partially-burnt body was found in the forests of Raigad district.\n\nThe CBI\u2019s reply submitted to the special CBI court read: \u201cIndrani has accepted that Peter was informed about the incident (murder) and she has admitted that Peter is part of the conspiracy.\u201d\n\nOne more ground for rejecting the bail was if it was granted, Peter might \u2018tamper\u2019 with the evidence.\u201d\n\nMr Mukherjea has been lodged at the Arthur Road Jail since December 2, and moved a bail application on January 4.\n\nThe bail application read: \u201cThe CBI has found no evidence to justify his (Peter) arrest and grounds for his arrest are inconsistent and ambivalent. The application also alleges that the agency was trying to concoct a motive for Peter so as to implicate him for conspiracy.\u201d\n\nJudge H.S. Mahajan was also hearing the bail application filed by Sanjeev Khanna, Indrani\u2019s former husband and a co-accused in the murder case.",
