Their adult daughter Tiffany stood next to them with their rescue dog Abby. The Robinsons, from the tiny town of Munford, with barely 5,000 residents, appeared overwhelmed by their incredible luck. The chances of winning were 1 in 292.2 million.\n\nThe couple told reporters that they wanted to pay off their daughter's student loans, but had no plans to move and wanted to continue working. They intend to donate funds to their church and a children's hospital and to help friends.\n\nRebecca Hargrove, president of the Tennessee Lottery Corporation, said they would have to wait 10 days for their actual winnings, which the commission would pay after retailers send in the proceeds of record ticket sales. \u2014 AFP",
