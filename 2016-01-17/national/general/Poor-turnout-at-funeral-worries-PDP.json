    "text": "When Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti will hold first party meeting in Srinagar on Sunday, one issue that will be weighing heavy on the minds is the poor attendance of people during the funeral of PDP patron Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who died on January 7.\n\nOnly around 5,000 people, including officials and party leaders, gathered in Srinagar\u2019s Sheri-e-Kashmir cricket stadium for the funeral.\n\nAt the same venue, the PDP succeeded to gather more than 12,000 supporters on November 7 for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Srinagar rally.\n\nThe party reluctantly admits to the dip in the popularity graph in Jammu and Kashmir after the PDP joined hands with the BJP, whose march it promised to stop in J&K during the election rallies.\n\nAdmitting to unexpected turn out for the Sayeed\u2019s funeral, PDP legislator and senior leader Nayeem Akhtar said, \u201cMr. Sayeed always practiced unpopular politics in Jammu and Kashmir. His politics was aimed at course correction for the mainstream wherever it went awry. He stood against [former Chief Minister] the popular and powerful leader Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah for a genuine democratic process to flourish in the State.\u201d\n\nHowever, other PDP leaders see the poor participation in the Chief Minister\u2019s funeral in Srinagar as \u201ca challenge posed by the polity of Jammu and Kashmir\u201d. In fact, the capital Srinagar behaved indifferent to the death of the Chief Minister with normal life remaining unaffected.\n\nThe funeral of Sayeed is a pointer to the larger political problem of the State where political parties continue to lose sway to separatists.",
