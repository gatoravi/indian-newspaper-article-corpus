    "text": "Initials as first names and religious names \u2014 Hari, Om and Jagdish, for instance \u2014 are most common among older men, while Rahul, Rohit and Amit are popular names for younger men.\n\nThe lack of a traditional culture of first names and last names, unlike in the West, poses unique challenges both to citizens and authorities.\n\nMuslim men, for example, routinely use \u201cMohammed\u201d as a prefix, which becomes their first name in government forms, leading to the high number of Mohammeds in Delhi. Mohammed Aslam (80), a retired Assistant Commissioner of Customs, who lives in Preet Vihar, though originally from the Jamia Masjid area, describes himself as a \u201cPakka Dilliwalla\u201d (true-blue Delhiite).\n\nMr. Aslam writes \u201cMohammed\u201d as his first name and \u201cAslam\u201d as his last name in government forms, though Aslam is the name friends and family know him by. His father was M. Yamin, and his sons are M. Rehan Aslam and M. Salman Aslam, the M standing for \u201cMohammed\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the challenges posed by complicated naming conventions across the country, Election Commission officials frequently err while entering details, former Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi says. Mr. Quraishi says he uses the expanded form of his initials, Shahabuddin Yakub, as his first name on his voter ID card, because he is known more commonly by those and to avoid errors. He has reasons to be cautious: his son-in-law\u2019s name has been incorrectly entered on his voter ID card, in addition to his father\u2019s name.\n\nVisit thehindu.com/data to search for your name.",
