Satchidanandan, one of the judges, said here on Saturday.\n\nHe said Nagaland was almost unexplored in Indian fiction and the book, with its profound symbolism, offered an alternative way of life. \u201cWe looked for freshness of content, individual style, innovativeness of the work in contributing to the genre and challenging existing conventions,\u201d he said, adding that while short lists were definitive, the prize was arbitrary.\n\n\u201cAny one or more of these authors could have won the prize,\u201d said Susie Tharu, another judge, explaining that the judging was a difficult process, but it had been made easier by the fact that no one was passionately invested in any one book.\n\nMs. Kire read out an excerpt from the novel, describing a scene in which the protagonist and another man escape from a river with the spirits of widowed women chasing after them with spears and curses.\n\nThanking her editors and publishers, Ms. Kire said, \u201cIt\u2019s not really my book \u2014 a lot of people embrace it as their book and I want to thank all my beautiful readers.\u201d\n\nThe citation said the book was a \u201ctender philosophical novel that speaks to the present moment in India\u201d.",
