    "text": "A unit in the defence sector for manufacturing helicopter and fighter aircraft parts was likely to be set up in Rajasthan, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said here on Saturday.\n\nThough the details were yet to be discussed and decided upon, Mr. Parrikar suggested that the unit would be set up between Jaipur and Delhi.\n\n\u201cIn Rajasthan there is no big defence manufacturing unit. The State\u2019s proximity to the [Pakistan] border is a reason. We are mulling over the issue of whether a unit could come up away from the border [for security reasons], between Jaipur and Delhi\u2026. The unit\u2019s proximity to Delhi would boost the supply chain,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said.\n\nAccording to the Rajasthan government website, 2,283.9 hectares of land has been identified \u201cacross the State at various industrial areas to promote and encourage defence manufacturing units to set up their plants.\u201d Speaking on the duration within which the decision would be taken, Mr. Parrikar said: \u201cI think it would be decided within this year. I spoke to [Rajasthan] Chief Minister [Vasundhara Raje] regarding this and she told me she has land for the project. However, the place is yet to be finalised.\u201d",
