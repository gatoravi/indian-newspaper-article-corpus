    "text": "Calling all the parties to join forces to defeat the ruling Trinamool Congress in the coming Assembly polls in the State, CPI (M) leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee exhorted the Congress spell out its stand on the proposed alliance with the Left parties.\n\n\u201cWe Leftists have come together. We are urging other Leftists to come with us to save the State from doom. We are appealing to all the parties. We are asking the Congress, on which side of the fence are you? On which side are you in this fight?\u201d Mr. Bhattacharjee said while flagging off a march from Singur in Hooghly district to Salboni in Paschim Medinipur.\n\nThe CPI (M) Polit Bureau member said that in the coming polls the Left parties \u201cwe will show that we are not alone in the fight to remove this government\u201d.\n\nWhile majority of State Congress leadership have expressed a desire to tie up with the Left Front, the party high command is yet to take a decision on the issue. Last week CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra asked the Congress to take a decision on the issue.\n\nMr. Bhattacharjee who flagged off the rally to protests against flight of industry from the State said, \u201cAgriculture is our base, industry is our future.\u201d",
