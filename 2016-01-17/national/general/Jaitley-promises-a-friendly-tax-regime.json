Freedom will be given to the sector from the State,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said.\n\nThe Minister said he was not familiar with most of the participants at the conference, and it was the first time that those other than the \u201cusual suspects\u201d were attending such a meeting. Since May 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was elected to office, the traffic of industry visiting North Block, where the Finance Ministry office functions, had ended. He said the government aimed to ensure that the role of the State became that of a facilitator.\n\nAt a panel discussion at the launch, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said the Start-up India mission would be a game changer for India by channelling investments and facilitating job creation.\n\nHe said starting a company in India was akin to entering the mythical \u201cChakravyuh\u201d as \u201cit is easier to get in than to get out\u201d. The Finance Ministry was in discussions with the Reserve Bank for online filing of returns under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, Mr. Das said. \u201cYou will see very quick action on that which will facilitate online filing of returns.\u201d\n\nMr. Jaitley said the government and the Reserve Bank would shore up the lending capacity of banks over the next few months. \u201cThe Reserve Bank and the government, acting in tandem, are going to add to bankers\u2019 ability to lend with vigour and in greater amounts,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said credit growth was critical to boosting India\u2019s sluggish economic growth, but had remained subdued, with banks struggling with crippling bad debts and insufficient capital. For that, the government and the RBI were planning to take measures to add to banks\u2019 lending capacity.\n\nOn the global economy, Mr. Jaitley said it had unquestionably slowed down and \u201cWe can take limited satisfaction that even in a crisis-like situation in the world, we are growing much faster\u201d.",
