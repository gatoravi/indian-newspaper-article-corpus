    "text": "There are at least two wars that India would rather forget and it\u2019s about these and how their stories were written that formed a conversation on Saturday afternoon at The Hindu Lit for Life.\n\nThe difference however, said Raghu Karnad, author of Farthest Field , was that his book was about a war in which India was the victor \u2014 the Second World War, while Shiv Kunal Verma\u2019s book 1962: The War that Wasn\u2019t , was about a conflict in which India lost \u2014 the military engagement with China.\n\nModerated by veteran journalist Sashi Kumar, the conversation between the authors focussed on differences in writing styles, why these wars are preferably forgotten and the choices made by people that led to the wars. \u201cIt is difficult to overestimate how much we have forgotten about World War II,\u201d said Mr. Karnad, explaining that Indians have been involved on three continents and helped turned the tide of the war.\n\nMr. Sashi Kumar\u2019s point on the intersection of the independence struggle with the war had Mr. Karnad reflect that while a divide was writ largely in India \u2014 about not supporting the war until Independence was given \u2014 delving deep into the personalities of the people he had written about made him realise that the conflict seemed to reside deeply inside all of them.\n\nMr. Verma, on being asked about Nehru being the villain of the 1962 conflict, explained that the leader was very sympathetic towards China and that his own perception had been contradictory to what everyone was advising him. \u201cHe also had a deep distrust of the military and was very insecure about it.\u201d\n\nOn the indignation apparent in the book, he said, \u201cThe story of 1962 is deliberately suppressed. Not only did we lose, we never fought.\u201d He added that if the army had been given the right kind of capability, the war may not have happened at all.\n\nOn writing styles \u2014 didactic and straightforward of Mr. Verma\u2019s and creative of Mr. Karnad\u2019s, the latter said that while the style in which he wrote would never replace formal, methodical works, there needed to be both forms of writing. \u201cMy work is non fiction in the sense that it is not fiction. All the movements and anecdotes are factual. But I used forensic license. I integrated the personal stories and impressions I had of the characters in order to narrate the interior experiences. This was integral to the book.\u201d",
