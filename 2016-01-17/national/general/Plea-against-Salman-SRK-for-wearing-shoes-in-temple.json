    "text": "A local court in Meerut on Saturday accepted a plea by Hindu Mahasabha against Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan for allegedly going to a temple with their shoes on, as seen in a television promo of a reality show on a private entertainment channel. The court fixed January 18 as the next date of hearing.\n\n\u201cThe entertainment channel shows Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan inside a Kali temple in the sheets of the reality show Big Boss which was broadcast last December. This offends my sentiments as a Hindu. So I approached the court,\u201d said Bharat Rajput, president of the Meerut unit of Hindu Mahasabha.",
