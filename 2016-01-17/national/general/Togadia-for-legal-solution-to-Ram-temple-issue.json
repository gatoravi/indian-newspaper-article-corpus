He said the Modi government should enact a law to make the construction of Ram temple possible at Ayodhya.\n\nDescribing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as his \u201celder brother\u201d, he said the VHP and its associates will not raise the issue of Ram temple building or launch an agitation demanding it until the Uttar Pradesh elections are over. He was confident that the Prime Minister would do everything to \u201crespect the Hindu sentiments.\u201d\n\nMr. Togadia recalled that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had enacted a law to make the re-building of Somnath temple possible. Mr. Modi should choose a similar path, he said. He was speaking after inaugurating the Bajrang Dal baitak here on Saturday. Asked about the Supreme Court saying that women cannot be banned from entering the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, he said while God favoured all equally, women should desist from being \u201cinfluenced by western culture\u201d.",
