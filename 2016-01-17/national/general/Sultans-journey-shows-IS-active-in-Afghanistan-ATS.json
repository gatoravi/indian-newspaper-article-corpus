When the friends questioned the necessity of extreme action, he quoted scriptures and asked them to learn the true meaning of jihad (holy war).\n\nMaharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad sources told The Hindu that Sultan\u2019s friends had asked him what he intended to do, and his answer had been a cryptic \u201cwait and watch\u201d. Sultan, officials said, uses a Wi-Fi connection for chatting on WhatsApp and never a SIM card. \u201cWe have been keeping an eye out to check where Sultan goes from Kabul, as we initially believed that he would try to go to Syria. However, according to latest inputs, the IS now has a considerable presence in Kabul, and Sultan seems to have joined this module ,\u201d an officer said. The Hindu , January 1, reported how the squad was investigating Sultan\u2019s Delhi connection, as he had travelled to Delhi twice before leaving the country.",
