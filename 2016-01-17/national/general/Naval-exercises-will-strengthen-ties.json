Gen. Angus Campbell says Malabar naval exercises are among a spate of opportunities in that regard.\n\nAustralia, which held its first bilateral naval exercise with the Indian Navy last year, has been long keen on joining the Malabar exercises along with the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\u201cMalabar is an example where there is opportunity to build but not in a directed or specific problematic part but one that is more comfortable for the two nations \u2026 It is part of a spate of opportunities,\u201d Lt. Gen. Campbell said in an interview to The Hindu .\n\nThe India-U.S. Malabar naval exercises, which began in 1992, have grown in scope and complexity, acquiring geopolitical significance in recent times. The bilateral format gave way to a trilateral one with inclusion of Japan as a permanent member in 2015.\n\nIn 2007, Australia joined the other three in a quadrilateral format for the exercises, but based severe criticism from China which saw it as a containment strategy.\n\nSpeaking separately to The Hindu , the outgoing Australian High Commissioner in India, Patrick Suckling, expressed interest in being part of Malabar, but said: \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t be the same as resurrecting that idea of four democracies doing what they had planned in 2007.\u201d\n\nHowever, clarifying that it was not directed at anyone, Lt. Gen. Campbell reiterated that it was Australia\u2019s position that discussion, negotiations and in some circumstances where appropriate, \u201carbitration of what might the interest of multiple parties should be considered and where that occurs that is the best pathway to reduce tensions and to build understanding\u201d.\n\nThe statement is important in the backdrop of the Philippines taking China to the International Court of Arbitration over disputed islands in the South China Sea. China has, however, rejected it, saying the international tribunal has no jurisdiction over the matter.\n\nTrading nations\n\nEmphasising that both India and Australia are \u201cmaritime trading nations\u201d, Lt. Gen. Campbell said that what that meant was the importance of the freedom of the seas and respect for the international law and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThose basic principles are important for both our countries and in that regard, we are both keen on working across with many partners to ensure that the security setting in this region does not deteriorate or present a challenge to the security, prosperity and stability of the people of the region.\u201d\n\nChina, which claims the part of the South China Sea up to the nine dash line as its own, has been reclaiming reefs in the region at a rapid pace. Recently, it landed civilian planes on a 3,000-metre airstrip on the Fiery Cross reef raising concern that fighter jets could follow next.\n\nLt. Gen. Campbell said that with growing prosperity, there was an increasing trend of military modernisation across Asia as was evident with India, China, Indonesia and others.\n\n\u201cWhere countries are growing and where peoples\u2019 prosperity is developing and that growth is engaged with partnership and dialogue that is very good,\u201d he said adding that concerns arose where action was taken unilaterally or in a non-cooperating way.\n\n\u201cBoth our nations seek to understand our security concerns by looking at the constructive security arrangements and the strategic settings across the India-Pacific oceans,\u201d Lt. Gen. Campbell added.\n\nLt. Gen. Campbell is in India on the invitation of the Chief of the Army Staff, Dalbir Singh, and held discussions with the three services \u201cto establish the right framework relationship\u201d to deepen military cooperation.\n\nEarlier this month, on a visit to Delhi, Admiral Scott Swift, the U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander, expressed concern at the lack of transparency on the Chinese motives for military expansion.\n\nWelcoming India\u2019s greater role in the region, Lt. Gen. Campbell said it was for India to decide its role.",
