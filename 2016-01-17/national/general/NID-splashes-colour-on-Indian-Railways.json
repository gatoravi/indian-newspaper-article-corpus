Two have been shortlisted, said Nijoo Dubey, associate faculty, who is heading this project along with three students. One of the colour schemes \u2014 with orange, dark blue and grey \u2014 has been inspired by the cheetah while another with bright green and two shades of blue draws from the beauty of the peacock.\n\nMs. Dubey said the designs are for the exterior and the interior of the train. \u201cOur designs are centred on the themes of pride, high speed and precision,\u201d she said.\n\nThe students and faculty of NID in the three campuses have also come up with several ideas to jazz up the coaches, interior utilities, passenger comfort, branding and railway station utilities. A railway design centre was set up in the three campuses after the institute entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Indian Railways last April for this purpose.",
