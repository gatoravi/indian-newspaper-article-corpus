The police produced Mr. Acharjee in a court, which remanded him in custody for three days.\n\nThe arrest comes a month after the CPI(M) leader was stripped of his primary membership and all party positions for allegedly molesting the girl in Amarpur in south Tripura on November 27. Mr. Acharjee subsequently sent his resignation letter to the Assembly Speaker.\n\nOn Friday, the main Opposition Congress raised the issue at the opening session of the Assembly, demanding the arrest of Mr. Acharjee.
