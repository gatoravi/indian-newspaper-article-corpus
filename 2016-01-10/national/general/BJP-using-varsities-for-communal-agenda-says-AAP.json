The party alleged that the move was aimed at the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nTerming it a \u201csensitive issue,\u201d senior AAP leader Ashutosh said the case is pending before the Supreme Court and the decision on it should be come from the judiciary and not outside.\n\n\u201cThere were riots in Muzaffarnagar before the Lok Sabha polls. Then there were communal riots in Delhi before the elections.. And before the U.P. polls, you (BJP) have brought up the Mandir issue again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti, the party's student wing, also protested against the seminar. The protesters were detained by the police and later let off.",
