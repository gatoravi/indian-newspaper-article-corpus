    "text": "Keen on making industrialisation a key issue in the 2016 Assembly polls, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will field former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in its upcoming mega march from Singur in Hooghly to Salboni in Paschim Medinipur district in West Bengal protesting the flight of capital from the State.\n\nMr. Bhattacharjee will flag off the march, organised by the Bengal Platform of Mass Organisations (BPMO) a platform of various organisations of Left parties, that will commence from December 16 and end on December 22.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of Bengal\u2019s industrial prospects started from Singur. The main slogan of the march will be \u2018we want industry, we want jobs\u2019. Mr. Bhattacharjee will attend the rally if his health permits,\u201d BPMO convener and State president of CPI(M)\u2019s labour wing, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Shyamal Chakraborty said on Saturday.\n\nThe decision to make Mr. Bhattacharjee face of the party\u2019s protests came amid the Global Bengal Business Summit, organised by Chief Minister Ms. Mamata Banerjee.\n\nIt was Mr. Bhattacharjee who invited the Tata Motors and JSW Steel to set up factories in Singur and Salboni respectively during the Left Front era. While the Tata Motors-small car factory project had to be aborted mid-way due to the Trinamool Congress agitation against forcible land acquisition, the proposed steel plant at Salboni never saw the light of the day.\n\nLast month at a rally on the Brigade Parade Grounds, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said only the Left Front could set up industry in Singur.\n\nThe destruction of West Bengal\u2019s industrial prospects started from Singur, says CITU leader",
