    "text": "An initiative in Kongappadam near Palakkad has boosted the morale of not just children but also parents\n\nIt was a chance visit by Qatar-based professional C.D. Sajith Kumar to his alma mater, Nair Service Society College of Engineering, Akathethara, near here, four years ago to attend a reunion, that set off a set of changes in the adjacent Dalit colony, Kongappadam.\n\nThough not far away from the hustle and bustle of Palakkad town, Kongappadam, with 230 people from 32 families, remained extremely backward, especially in education, till recently.\n\n\u201cOnly three persons from the colony had attended high school in over 60 years owing to discrimination and neglect. Nothing happened in the colony in the two decades since I left the college \u2014 it remained frozen in a time warp,\u201d recalls Sajith Kumar, who started an educational initiative using the facilities of a single room anganwadi.\n\nThe result has been overwhelming. Sajith\u2019s efforts brought many educationists, teachers and experts to Kongappadam. In three years, a dozen colony students passed school final with flying colours and joined higher education.\n\nTitled Ente Kongappadam , the initiative has won the appreciation of the government and socio-educational initiatives. \u201cThe project is not just about running a tuition centre. It is aimed at boosting the morale of not just students, but their parents too ,\u201d said activist Dhanya Raman.",
