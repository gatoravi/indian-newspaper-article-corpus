It is very disgusting, ridiculous and dangerous for the unity and integrity of this country as talking about one religion at such functions is nothing but to provoke the sentiments of other religions,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that it was for the first time that people heard at the Congress about Lord Shiva as an environmentalist while someone presented a paper on the medical effects of blowing of a conch shell ( s hankh ). At the 103rd Indian Science Congress that concluded on Thursday, a paper by the Chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Private University Regulatory Commission hailing Lord Shiva as the greatest environmentalist in the world was shortlisted for presentation. \u201cThe govternment should come out with a strong statement so that such things are not repeated.\u201d",
