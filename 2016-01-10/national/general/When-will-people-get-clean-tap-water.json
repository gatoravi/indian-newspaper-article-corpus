He asked the Chief Minister when the people of Bihar will get clean tap water for drinking.\n\nAddressing a function here on Friday, the RJD chief referred to the Nitish government\u2019s ongoing cleanliness programme in the State, and pointed out: \u201cOne day I asked Nitish Kumar when people who voted us to power will get clean water, tap water?.\u201d \u201cThe hand-pumps have become defunct and don\u2019t work well in the State\u2026 the problem of non-availability of safe drinking water continues.\u201d\n\nIt was for the first time that Mr. Prasad has pointed fingers directly at the government\u2019s functioning and lack of concern towards people of the State. Earlier in the day, he had expressed differences with Mr. Nitish Kumar on the Prime Minister\u2019s recent Pakistan visit and the Pathankot terrorist attack. Some time ago, he embarrassed the Nitish Kumar government saying that the law and order situation in the State was not good as the police had become lunj-punj (slack). Later, he reportedly invited the JD(U)\u2019s ire when he conducted a surprise inspection of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, where he gave instruction to the authorities and later to his Health Minister-son Tej Pratap Yadav.\n\n\u201cRecently I rang up the superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital to keep every equipment ... oxygen mask and other things in the emergency ward in ready order,\u201d said Mr. Prasad at a function organised at Patna\u2019s A.N. Sinha Institute on Friday.\n\nThe Opposition BJP took a swipe at Mr. Prasad\u2019s statement in an oblique reference to his alliance partner. \u201cSince the beginning, we\u2019ve been saying Nitish Kumar is Chief Minister but Lalu is super CM\u2026 actually he is running the government,\u201d alleged senior BJP leader Prem Kumar.",
