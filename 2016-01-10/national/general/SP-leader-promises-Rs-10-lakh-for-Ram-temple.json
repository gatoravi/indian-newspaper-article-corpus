    "text": "Weeks after the ruling Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh sacked a senior advisor-cum-minister for urging Muslims to participate in \u201cKarseva,\u201d a party MLC has now promised to donate Rs 10 lakh and a gold crown for a temple at the disputed site.\n\nSenior leader Bukkal Nawab while daring the BJP to construct a Ram temple in Ayodhya said that though the matter was in Court, the BJP was busy announcing dates for the construction of a temple.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is politicising the issue and misleading people. It held power both at the Centre and State but did nothing. It is not their intention to build a Ram temple. I challenge them to start construction for a Temple and I will donate Rs 10 lakh and a gold crown,\u201d Mr. Nawab said.\n\nThe SP, however, downplayed Mr. Nawab\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing if Mr. Nawab gets the temple constructed. But he has not specified where the temple will be constructed,\u201d said SP Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav.\n\nBukkal Nawab says BJP is politicising the issue and misleading people on the issue.",
