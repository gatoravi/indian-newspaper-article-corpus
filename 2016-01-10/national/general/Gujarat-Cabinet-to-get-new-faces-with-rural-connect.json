The State goes to polls next year.\n\nAnother push factor is the Patidar quota agitation, which is resurfacing after a hiatus.\n\n\u201cAfter the appointments of new party president and other office bearers, there will be reshuffle in the Cabinet. The Chief Minister has already consulted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the party president Amit Shah,\u201d said a top source in the government.\n\n\u201cIn the proposed exercise, Ms. Patel will seemingly give importance to the MLAs belonging to the Saurashtra region.
