She had reportedly spoken to his daughter and Peoples Democratic Party leader, Mehbooba Mufti, on the phone.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ramvilas Paswan are likely to attend the fourth day of mourning.\n\nSpeculation\n\nAmid speculation that partner BJP wanted to change the \u201crules of engagement\u201d, the party\u2019s State president clarified: \u201cThere are certainly no conditions from our side and there was no meeting of our leaders on government formation. We respect the right of the bereaved family of Mufti Sahib to mourn his death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have firm faith in the BJP, a partner chosen by our patron Mufti sahib. And they are cooperating too without creating any hurdles,\u201d senior PDP leader Altaf Bukhari, and a Cabinet minister in the Mufti government, told The Hindu . \u201cShe (Mehbooba) is like her father Mufti sahib. She wants to take her own time,\u201d Mr. Bukhari said.\n\nHowever, the presence of Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, at Mufti\u2019s residence for two consecutive days and his visit to the graveyard 50 km from here have fuelled speculation.\n\n\u201cMy visit to Bijbehara was purely a mark of respect for Mufti Sahib. Nothing political about it,\u201d said Mr Azad.",
