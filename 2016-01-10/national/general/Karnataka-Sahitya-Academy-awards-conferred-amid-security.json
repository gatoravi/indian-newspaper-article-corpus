Bhagavan, who had received threats from right-wing groups, and others amid unprecedented security on Saturday.\n\nThe Academy was threatened with dire consequences if it honoured Prof. Bhagavan with the Lifetime Achievement Award for 2013, in the light of his controversial comments on Hindu epics.\n\nThe event saw two award winners \u2014 Rahamat Tarikere and T.K. Dayanand \u2014 absenting themselves in protest against the government\u2019s inability to make any headway in the M.M. Kalburgi murder case. Though filmmaker B. Suresh received the award, he donated the cash prize towards organising a symposium on contemporary concerns of writers and to bringing out a volume of papers presented there.\n\n\u201cDr. Tarikere told me over phone that he had not recovered from the shock of Kalburgi\u2019s death, and was not in a position to receive another award and celebrate,\u201d said Malathi Pattanshetty, Chairperson of the Academy.\n\nProf. Bhagavan, along with B.N. Sumithra Bai, Rajendra Chenni and Mogalli Ganesh, received the award at Ravindra Kalakshetra.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the award winners, Prof. Chenni said he was accepting the honour in solidarity because the award was being conferred on rationalist Prof. Bhagavan despite threats.\n\nTwo awardees stay away to protest lack of progress in the Kalburgi\n\nmurder probe",
