    "text": "He said the Congress would beat the AAP because the latter had no face or programme to offer. \u201cJust look at what the Chief Minister [Mr. Kejriwal] is doing in Delhi; whenever he can\u2019t solve a problem, he blames the government or [Finance Minister Arun] Jaitley or [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi. In 60 years I\u2019m yet to meet a Chief Minister who blames others for his own inability to work,\u201d he said. \u201cSheila Dikshit, when she was Chief Minister, achieved so much without once blaming the Centre,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year since his government came to power, has he given 7,500 litres of free water or electricity,\u201d he asked.\n\nHe added that it was this feeling this was a feeling that the party had to beat to win the Assembly polls, due in early 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to say that these people don\u2019t have a face or programme. We have had 10 years of bad governance, and we may not recover if another bad government is elected,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe former Punjab Chief Minister said the Centre\u2019s handling of the combing operations in the Pathankot airbase was a bungle, an attempt by civilian authorities to steer counter-insurgency efforts through a force, the NSG, that was not equipped for the job. \u201cThis was a Lt. Colonel\u2019s job, or maximum a company commandant, what was the need for these chaps from Manesar to fly in for a job that the Army is trained for,\u201d he asked. But he said the dialogue with Pakistan must continue.\n\n(For full interview\n\nvisit bit.ly/22S0msS)",
