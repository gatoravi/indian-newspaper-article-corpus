    "text": "Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh on Saturday criticised the alleged nexus between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.\n\nReiterating his party\u2019s demand for a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into the mining and chit fund scams in Odisha at a press conference here, Mr. Ramesh termed Mr. Patnaik as the patient, Mr. Modi as the ventilator and the CBI as the oxygen.\n\nReferring to the recent comment by Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram in which he purportedly said the Centre had let the State government off in many issues, including the chit fund and mining scams, Mr. Ramesh alleged that Mr. Modi was misusing the CBI to help the Odisha Chief Minister in return for the BJD\u2019s support in Parliament.\n\nStating that the Congress had full confidence in the CBI but not in Mr. Modi, Mr. Ramesh said justice would be served to 20 lakh investors in Odisha if the CBI continued to carry out the investigation impartially into the Rs. 50,000 crore chit fund scam.\n\nThe Congress leader said Mr. Oram, a tribal himself, had accidentally spoken the truth since he was not being treated well by several Central Ministers, including the Prime Minister and Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar and Dharmendra Pradhan, who were trying to dilute the Forest Rights Act to protect the interest of industries by sacrificing the interests of tribal people.\n\nRegarding the mining scam, Mr. Ramesh expressed concerns that the Modi government had been sitting over the M.B. Shah Commission\u2019s recommendation for a CBI probe into allegations of corruption made against politicians, bureaucrats and others in the mining scam.",
