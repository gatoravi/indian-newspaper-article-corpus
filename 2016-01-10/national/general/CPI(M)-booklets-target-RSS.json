In doing so, it seeks to exploit religious feelings and utilises traditions and beliefs based on social and gender inequalities that still influence a substantial section of our people.\u201d\n\nOne of the booklets quotes Mookerjee, then Finance Minister in the \u201cBengal government headed by a member of the Muslim League Fazlul Haq,\u201d making a \u201cproposal\u201d to the Bengal governor instead of resigning on August 9, 1942, as the Quit India Movement was launched.\n\n\u201cThe question is how to combat this movement [Quit India] in Bengal? The administration of the province should be carried on in such a manner that in spite of the best efforts of the Congress, this movement will fail to take root in the province \u2026 Indians have to trust the British, not for the sake of Britain, not for any advantage that the British might gain, but for the maintenance of the defence and freedom of the province itself,\u201d it quotes Mookerjee as saying.\n\n\u2018Vajpayee turned approver\u2019\n\nThe booklet says that while Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar had appealed to the British for mercy from the cellular jail in the Andamans, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had turned \u201capprover\u201d during the Quit India Movement, \u201cleading to the arrest of some freedom fighters\u201d, reviving decade-old controversies.\n\nIt also cites extracts of second RSS chief M.S. Golwalkar\u2019s writings in We \u2014 Or Our Nationhood Defined : \u201c\u2026 the foreign races in Hindustan must either adopt the Hindu culture and language, must learn to respect and hold in reverence Hindu religion\u2026 and must lose their separate existence to merge in the Hindu race, or may stay in the country, wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation\u2026\u201d\n\nOne booklet seeks to link this to the killing of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri in 2015. \u201cThe act of the murder of a Muslim accused of cow slaughter through a manufactured rumour is to send a message to the community,\u201d the booklet says.",
