The State is the only Indian destination to have made it to the New York Time\u2019s list of 52 places to go in 2016.\n\nAt no. 24 on the list, the entry for Tamil Nadu reads in parts: \u201c\u2026Tamil Nadu in the south has an equally rich and undiscovered history\u2026temples aren\u2019t the only cultural hit\u2026it also boasts cuisine that is among the spiciest and most aromatic in the country.\u201d The entry mentions new hotels in Chettinad, Madurai and Thanjavur.\n\nFor travel blogger Lakshmi Sharath, the State\u2019s entry on the list is validating what she keeps saying and writing about: \u201cTamil Nadu is the original God\u2019s own country. We have everything here \u2014 from the pristine beauty of the Western Ghats to beaches, Kumbakonam degree coffee and food. The Coromandel coast is one of the most interesting to explore \u2013 it is littered with old forgotten relics of the colonies. We have architecture from at least three major dynasties. t just happens to be an unexplored destination,\u201d she said.",
