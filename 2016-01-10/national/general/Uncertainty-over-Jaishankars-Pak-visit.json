Jaishankar will travel to Male and Colombo from January 11 to 14, raising a bigger question over whether he will travel to Islamabad on January 15.\n\nDiplomatic sources told The Hindu that while the talks in Sri Lanka and the Maldives had been in the offing for some time, they had been held off pending the Pakistan talks.\n\n\u201cWith the talks in Islamabad being clouded until there is action on the ground from the Pakistan government, it was decided to go ahead with these other visits independently,\u201d an official said.\n\nIn Islamabad, Mr. Jaishankar\u2019s counterpart, Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry, sounded an uncertain note on Saturday, in stark contrast to comments made by the government in Parliament a day earlier.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a position to say anything about the Foreign Secretary-level talks at this moment,\u201d Mr. Chaudhry told the Aaj TV channel in Pakistan.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz told the National Assembly that Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Chaudhry would meet on January 15 in Islamabad \u201cas scheduled\u201d to lay the framework of the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue (CBD) that had been decided during the December 8-9 visit by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Islamabad. Diplomatic sources, however, maintained that Pakistan\u2019s steps in response to India\u2019s requests have not been encouraging, especially after a background briefing given by officials in Islamabad who told the Pakistani media that evidence provided by India \u201cwas not enough\u201d.\n\nSources, however, said that the Foreign Secretary\u2019s visit to Maldives and Sri Lanka did not \u201crule out\u201d his visit to Islamabad.",
