Moorthy\n\nThe government is considering giving Aadhaar cards to non-resident Indians and a decision on it will be taken soon, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said here on Saturday while inviting the diaspora community to actively participate in India\u2019s growth story.\n\nIn her address to the first limited edition of Pravasi Bhartiya Divas, Ms. Swaraj said it had been decided that women workers would be allowed to go to Gulf countries for employment only through the government agencies to ensure they were not duped by recruiting agents or firms.\n\nThe PBD, webcast by almost all Indian Missions and Posts, was organised for the first time by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) after the government\u2019s decision to merge Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) with it.\n\nEarlier the MOIA used to host the event. January 9 was chosen as the day for PBD as it was on this day in 1915 that Mahatma Gandhi, the \u201cgreatest Pravasi,\u201d returned home from South Africa to lead India\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\nAsking the diaspora to participate in government\u2019s various flagship programmes including the Skill India, the Digital India and the Clean Ganga initiatives, she said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted the Aadhaar card scheme to be extended to the NRIs.\n\n\u201cSo far, Aadhaar card has been given to those Indians who live in India. It is not for non-resident Indians. But you will be happy to know that the Prime Minister wants the card to be given to the NRIs the way it is issued to people living in India.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe even wants it for OCI (Overseas Citizens of India card) holders. The matter is under our consideration. No decision has been taken as discussions on it are underway. I hope soon you will hear about it,\u201d Ms. Swaraj said during an interaction after her address.\n\nThe government has so far issued Aadhaar cards to over 92 crore citizens. Under the programme, every citizen is to be provided with a 12-digit unique identification number for which biometric information is collected.\n\n\u2018Time to come back\u2019\n\nCalling upon the diaspora to be part of the India growth story, the Minister said: \u201cIt is time for you to come back to India.\u201d\n\nEffusive in praise of the Prime Minister, Ms. Swaraj said India\u2019s engagement with the overseas Indians had increased manifold because of his constant endeavour to reach out to the community. She also referred to Mr. Modi\u2019s Madison Square address in the U.S. and at the Wembly in London.\n\n\u201cYour achievements in the countries of your adoption are a matter of pride... It is our responsibility to protect you and take care of you. Indeed, we are you and you are us,\u201d the Minister said. \u2014 PTI",
