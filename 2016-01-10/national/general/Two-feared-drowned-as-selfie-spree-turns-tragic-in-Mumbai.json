He saw the girls falling into the water and rushed towards the sea. Witnesses told the police that he jumped into the water without hesitation.

The police and fire brigade rushed teams to the spot. By Saturday afternoon, the Coast Guard had pressed a chopper into service to try and trace the missing. \u201cSearch and rescue operations were called off in the evening because of failing light.
