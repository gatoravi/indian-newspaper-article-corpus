We will use this to shape future policies related to reducing both in the coming days after a meticulous analysis of the same,\u201d he said.\n\n5,893 challans\n\nMr. Rai had, during the day, presided over a meeting of the Coordination Committee for the initiative held at his Civil Lines residence following which he also released data stating that from January 1 to January 8, enforcement teams consisting of the traffic police in addition to the transport and revenue departments had issued 5,893 challans for violation of its various regulations.",
