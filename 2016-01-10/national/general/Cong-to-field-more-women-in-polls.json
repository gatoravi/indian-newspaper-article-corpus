But the success of women candidates in the recently concluded Bihar elections, Ms. Oza said, has changed that perception.\n\n\u201cWe are working right from the local body level to find out potential women candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cWe learned in Bihar that women are able to cut through identity politics and connect with the masses on governance issues.\u201d\n\nIn Bihar, the Congress fielded five women candidates out of its total share of 43 seats. Four candidates emerged victorious; one of them, Amita Bhushan, defeated a male BJP candidate in Begusarai by 17,000 votes.\n\nMs. Oza said political parties largely fielded women candidates in those areas where the chances of winning were bleak. But Ms. Bhushan\u2019s victory was evidence enough that women could mobilise support amid a lot of second guessing emanating even from the parties they represent.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Ms. Bhushan said she had done enough \u201chomework\u201d to swing the voter sentiment in her favour.\n\n\u201cI extensively travelled in my constituency and educated people about the welfare policies of the state and Central government,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not talk about caste or religion.\u201d\n\nThe Congress recently performed well in the Gujarat civic polls. Ms. Oza said that taking a cue from Bihar, the party had increased women\u2019s participation to 65 per cent in 36 seats in the State.\n\n\u201cThere are more women corporators then men in Baroda,\u201d she said adding that the party had rolled out more funds to emulate the Bihar model when it comes to fielding candidates. \u201cWomen candidates are able to defeat the culture of goondaism in politics,\u201d Ms. Oza said. \u201cYou will see more women winning elections,\u201d she said.",
