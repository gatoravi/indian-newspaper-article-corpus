Lauded bravery & determination of our men & women on the ground. They are our pride,\u201d Mr. Modi said in another tweet.\n\nSeveral experts have questioned the employment of the National Security Guard and Garud commandos in the operations and the lack of a unified command and control structure.\n\nBarely a week after Mr. Modi\u2019s surprise stop at Lahore on Christmas eve on the way back from Kabul, six terrorists, allegedly owing allegiance to the Jaish-e-Mohammed, breached the perimeter wall of the airbase, one of Air Force\u2019s key bases on the western border. While all the terrorists were gunned down, seven security personnel were killed and 20 injured in the four-day standoff.\n\nOn Friday, security agencies declared that sanitisation of the base was complete.\n\nIndia has furnished evidence to Pakistan on the attack, which includes intercepts of telephone calls between the terrorists and their handlers in Pakistan and details of the arms and ammunition made in Pakistan.",
