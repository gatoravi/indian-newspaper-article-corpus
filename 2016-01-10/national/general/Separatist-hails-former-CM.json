He gauged the direction of the course between India and Pakistan, now getting closer to each other.\n\n\u201cGrowing relation between India and Pakistan is a tribute which I want to pay to the departed soul. It was a fruit of the seed he [Mr Sayeed] sowed in the minds of people, not only in J&K, but in India and Pakistan too.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Mirwaiz distanced himself from the reported visit paid by Mr. Bhat to Sayeed at his residence during the government formation.\n\nMr. Bhat\u2019s move to praise Mufti has come just a day after militant outfit Jamiat-ul-Mujhadeen criticised Geelani for sending condolences message.",
