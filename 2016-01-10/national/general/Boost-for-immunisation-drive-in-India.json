While historically India has been slow in introducing new vaccines, over the last few years, we have seen a definite speeding up of the programmes. Also, with the polio immunisation programme, India has proved that it is possible to reach every child,\u201d Dr. Berkley said, speaking to The Hindu of his great optimism from the partnership.\n\nHe also lauded the Prime Minister and the Health Minister for taking the initiative.\n\n\u201cThe Gavi team will create a joint action plan with the government, marking out specific milestones and timelines, and providing targeted release of funds. There will also be an active communication programme to take the message of vaccination to people and explain the benefits of the new vaccine,\u201d Dr. Berkley explained.\n\nGavi procures 60 per cent of its vaccines from Indian manufacturers. It is hoped that through the partnership, Gavi and the Government of India will work more closely together.\n\nThe idea is to reach the unreached and increase access to vaccines for children",
