    "text": "Episodes of mass stranding of whales across the world show pilot whales to be the most commonly involved in the phenomenon.\n\nMore than one hypothesis on stranding of whales, including short-finned pilot whales that died in large numbers on the Thoothukudi coast , points to hearing sensitivity of these toothed mammals implicated in such events. It is possible, for instance, that a combination of environmental factors such as high levels of noise from shipping activity, the resulting hearing loss and new stresses might be affecting their behaviour. The journal, PLoS One , reported sometime ago that researchers discovered hearing impairment in a stranded short-finned pilot whale, besides similar loss in other species of stranded dolphins.",
