The first broad gauge trial train was rolled out here in the presence of Mr. Sinha, State PWD Minister Badal Chowdhury and Transport Minister Manik Dey. Mr. Sinha said the construction of 15-km railway track connecting Agartala with Akhaura in Bangladesh \u201cis a top priority.\u201d The project is funded by the Centre for connecting Tripura and West Bengal via Bangladesh.\n\nHe said the process of acquiring land in Bangladesh was complete and it would start soon in India. A 3.7-km track on Indian side would be a viaduct [through an elevated corridor] to reduce the cost of acquisition of land.\n\nLaying of railway line from Agartala to Sabroom in South Tripura district, bordering Bangladesh, would be completed by 2018, he said. \u2014 PTI",
