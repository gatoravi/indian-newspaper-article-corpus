    "text": "Three days ahead of Prime Minister Narendara Modi\u2019s launch of the \u201cStart Up India\u201d policy, Congress said on Wednesday that the BJP government must clarify its stand on Net neutrality as the idea of \u201clarge companies\u201d taking control of the Internet would affect the country\u2019s start-up economy.\n\n\u201cThere must be a clear and categorical statement from the government that it will support Net neutrality and not allow large companies to restrict access to the Internet,\u201d said senior Congress leader and former Union Minister for Environment Jairam Ramesh. \u201cIt should be the responsibility of the government to provide Internet access to all and set a clear target date by which there will be universal Internet access to all Indians.\u201d\n\nTaking a dig at Prime Minister Modi\u2019s upcoming announcement of Start Up India, Mr. Ramesh said India received $90 billion in venture capital and private equity financing for 4000 companies between 2004 and 2014, of which at least 2000 may well be start-ups.\n\n\u201cAs usual, the Prime Minister will be claiming credit for this and repackaging what the Congress had already put in place,\u201d he said.\n\nMr.Ramesh said Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi recognised the need for creating jobs in the start-up ecosystem.\n\nAfter meeting around 30 entrepreneurs in New Delhi and Bengaluru, Mr.Gandhi realised that the government should provide \u201call possible support\u201d to start-up economy. \u201cCongress will work hard to advocate for them, both with the Central government, and in the State where the party is in power,\u201d he said.",
