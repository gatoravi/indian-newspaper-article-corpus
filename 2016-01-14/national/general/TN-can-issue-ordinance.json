    "text": "The Centre on Wednesday said it was in no position to bring in an ordinance to lift the ban on jallikattu but it would support the State government if it used its powers to promulgate one.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at Mahabhalipuram near here, Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said the State government could invoke its jurisdiction under Entry 38 [sic Entry 33 of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution] and promulgate an ordinance.\n\n\u201cIf the State brings such an ordinance the Centre will support it,\u201d she said, adding that the option was not available to the Centre as the matter was sub judice.\n\nEntry 33 of the Seventh Schedule brings theatrical and dramatic performances, cinema and sports, entertainment and amusements under the ambit of the State List.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s comment came on a day the Supreme Court declined to vacate its stay on the Centre\u2019s January 7 notification to allow the conduct of \u2018Jallikattu.\u2019 State BJP president Tamilisai Soundararajan said the party leadership had communicated after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the State had the option to bring in an ordinance on the issue. \u201cIf the Centre promulgates an ordinance, it will be easily stayed and would jeopardise a permanent solution to this issue,\u201d she claimed.",
