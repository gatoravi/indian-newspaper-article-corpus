Due to admixture with local people for several generations, their genetic mutations which make them susceptible for various cancers were almost absent.\n\nThere are three main distinct Jewish groups living in India \u2014 the Jews of Kochi in Kerala, South India; the Bene Israel in Mumbai, West India; and Baghdadi Jews in Kolkata, East India. Each of these communities is socially linked to their neighbours than one another. CCMB Director Ch. Mohan Rao said that to trace the mixture of Indian Jewish populations, the researchers analysed the DNA of Indian Jewish people using high resolution genetic markers and compared them with native Indian populations and people from the rest of the world.\n\nThe analysis of autosomal data revealed a high level of heterogeneity among the Indian Jewish groups and their closeness with local neighbours.\n\nHowever, sharing of specific maternally inherited mtDNA and paternally inherited Y-chromosomal haplogroups between all the studied Indian Jewish groups and lack of them among other local Indian populations can be seen as a remnant of a shared ancestry with Middle Eastern populations.\n\nIt is estimated that the first Jewish group entered Indian subcontinent 1,500 years ago",
