    "text": "The Chief of the Army Staff, General Dalbir Singh, on Wednesday put up a vociferous defence of the government\u2019s counter-terror operations in Pathankot, saying the Army was in control of it and he monitored the situation.\n\nBut his defence of the Centre, however, raised several questions, including the contradiction in the claims of the Air Force and the government. His statements went against the observations of security experts about the Army\u2019s failure to put up a security perimeter.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Army is concerned, it was not under anybody; it was under Army Commander, Western Command.. He was [Army Commander] the one controlling the operation,\u201d Gen. Singh said at the annual press conference ahead of Army Day. He said the Army Para Special Forces were present on the ground. \u201cOn the ground, it was the Army Brigade Commander who was controlling the operation.\u201d",
