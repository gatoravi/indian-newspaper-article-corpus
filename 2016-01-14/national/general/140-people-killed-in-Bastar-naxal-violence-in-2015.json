Forty-seven civilians were killed by the ultras in 2015, according to statistics released by Chhattisgarh police\u2019s Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) unit on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces managed to kill 46 Maoists and recovered 167 weapons, including an AK-47, an SLR, a 303 gun and four 9 mm pistols.\n\n\u201cMost of our men died in independent killings rather than during anti-Maoist operations,\u201d R.K.
