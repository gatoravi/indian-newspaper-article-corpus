    "text": "Even as Nestle claimed that tests showed Maggi noodles to be safe, the Supreme Court on Wednesday remained cautious and asked a government laboratory at Mysore to further clarify that the lead and glutamic acid content in the popular noodles is within permissible parameters.\n\nThe Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra said its caution stems from the concern that the noodles brand is the favourite food of the young generation.\n\n\u201cWe would like the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, to apprise this court on two aspects: whether the test report relating to lead and glutamic acid are within the permissible parameters and if these are within the parameters prescribed under the Food Safety Act,\u201d Justice Misra observed.\n\nThe Bench refused to pass any interim order. It posted the hearing for April 15.",
