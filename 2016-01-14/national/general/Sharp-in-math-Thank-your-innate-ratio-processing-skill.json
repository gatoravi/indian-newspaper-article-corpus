    "text": "An innate ratio processing ability may serve as the building block for math knowledge and help in determining our aptitude for understanding fractions and other formal mathematical concepts, new research has found.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that human beings come wired with a sort of naive non-symbolic ratio processing ability and that differences in these abilities have meaningful effects on the development of mathematical thinking,\u201d said Percival Matthews, psychological scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nBasic ability\n\nThe researchers hypothesised that we must have some basic ability that allows us to reason, in an informal way, about proportions.\n\n\u201cThe human brain existed way before we had things like math and reading, which means that however we do these things, we have to sort out recycle abilities that the brain already has,\u201d Mr. Matthews said. To investigate this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 181 college undergraduates to participate in their study. The research was published in the journal Psychological Science . \u2014 IANS",
