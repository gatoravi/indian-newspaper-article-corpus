The 24 x 7 radio satellite channel, which users can access on TV too, will be called \u2018Raagam\u2019 and will air Carnatic and Hindustani music.\n\nApart from the Direct To Home platform that the broadcast will be available on, the programme will be simultaneously webcast, according to officials of Akashavani Bengaluru. The music channel will be inaugurated by A. Surya Prakash, Prasar Bharati Chairman, at Bengaluru\u2019s Town Hall on January 26. \u201cBengaluru is more involved in technical broadcast and content management, even as 14 other stations will officially contribute to its programmes,\u201d said Dr. N. Raghu, Programme Executive, Akashavani Bengaluru, who is also in charge of \u2018Raagam.\u2019\n\nFor millions of radio enthusiasts, medium-wave plays spoilsport with its noisy interruptions and signal breaks. \u201cWe are aware that even radio manufacturers were finding it difficult to satisfy connoisseurs \u2026 Prasar Bharati\u2019s move to create \u2018Raagam\u2019 on DTH with concurrent webcast will bring in clarity,\u201d said Mr. Raghu adding that the App for Webcast has been developed.\n\nThe channel will introduce personalised interactions with listeners in its broadcast and research-oriented capsules. While Akashavani stations in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Dharwad, Bhopal and Lucknow will contribute to Raagam\u2019s Hindustani music, Bengaluru, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchi, Thrissur, Hyderabad and Vijayawada will provide Carnatic content. \u201cWe in AIR have the largest artistes pool. Add to this our own recording for \u2018Raagam\u2019 at every station and our biggest archival pool. This will bring in variety and diversity,\u201d said Mr. Raghu.\n\nThe classical channel could occupy the space created by satellite radio Worldspace after it shut down. \u201cWe are starting off with no advertisements though and will decide on the flow gradually,\u201d say officials.\n\nThe 24x7 radio channel will air Carnatic and Hindustani music from Jan. 26",
