Dave, Kurian Joseph and Amitava Roy agreed to the submissions made by counsel Soli Sorabjee and K.T.S. Tulsi that Mr. Latorre, who suffered a brain stroke and returned to Italy to recuperate in September 2014, needed more time.\n\nSenate stance\n\nOn Tuesday, the president of the defence committee of the Italian Senate said Mr. Latorre would not return.\n\n\u201cMassimiliano Latorre will not go back to India, and work is being done on the possibility of requesting for Salvatore Girone to be able to return to Italy,\u201d Senatore Nicola Latorre (not related to the marine) was quoted as saying by Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency.\n\nLatorre has been given periodic extensions by the Supreme Court to stay back ever since he left the country. Girone, however, is still in India.\n\nIn August 2015, the court suspended all proceedings in India against the marines following an interim order passed by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) asking India to maintain \u201cstatus quo\u201d till the issue of which country had the right to conduct the trial was decided. Italy has invoked international arbitration challenging India\u2019s jurisdiction to try the marines.\n\nArbitration\n\nTo a question from Justice Roy when the arbitration proceedings would be concluded, Mr. Sorabjee said it might take at least a year. However, the court asked Additional-Solicitor General Pinky Anand to take instructions from the government and report back on April 13 on how long the proceedings would take.\n\n\u201cWe will post it on April 13. We will decide then on what future course of action to take in the case,\u201d Justice Kurian explained to the court for the Bench.\n\nSupreme Court agrees to submission that Latorre needs more time to recover",
