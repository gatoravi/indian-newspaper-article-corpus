    "text": "At a time when not many in government jobs entertain the thought of switching tracks mid-career, a Hyderabad man, who left his job with the Indian Railways, has developed a live mobile streaming app in the U.S. in association with his friends.\n\nThe WeVoo App helps stream events live, be it a family function, public programmes or even tuitions. Apart from telecasting real time, users also get to store the videos in the Cloud up to 5GB. Its user base, explains Krishna Kumar, who shifted to the U.S. about one and a half years ago, can be as diverse from family members, politicians, companies to filmstars.\n\nWhat makes the app different, he says, is the registration process through mobile, unlike a few others for whom it is through Twitter account that lends the broadcast authenticity. Both private and public broadcast options are available, allowing the users to decide on who gets to view what they are broadcasting. Wevoo is the first app from the company set up by 42-year-old Kumar, Harry Sangha and Deepak Khanduri in New Jersey. \u201cOur focus is on making the app popular big time,\u201d the former Indian Railways and IRCTC employee says, adding the revenue model is based on advertisements.",
