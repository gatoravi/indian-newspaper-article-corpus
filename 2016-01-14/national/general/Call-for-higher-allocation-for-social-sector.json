    "text": "A meeting of civil society organisations held here has called upon Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to go in for a substantial increase in the budgetary allocations for social sector such as education, health, right to work, and right to food.\n\nThe People\u2019s Budget Initiative, organised by the Institute of Sustainable Development and Governance (ISDG) here on Tuesday, said it is of paramount importance that the integrity of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Food Security Act is maintained to ensure reduction of rural poverty and increasing inequality. This requires a substantial increase in budget for the social sector. Making the keynote presentation, John Samuel, co-founder of the People\u2019s Budget Initiative, pointed out that in terms of the volume of assistance, the grants given for Central schemes as a ratio of GDP have been reduced from 1.94 per cent in 2014-15 to 1.39 per cent in 2015-16.",
