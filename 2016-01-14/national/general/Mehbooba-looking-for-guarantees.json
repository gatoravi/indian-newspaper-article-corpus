    "text": "Several attempts by the BJP to jump-start the dialogue on government formation in Jammu and Kashmir with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) failed to take off on Wednesday as PDP president Mehbooba Mufti insisted on sharing her \u201cassessment of nine-month progress with the highest level in the BJP\u201d before taking over the reins.\n\nMourning calls by top BJP leaders and Union Ministers like Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadhkari, besides BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, \u201cwere highly political in nature and were not limited to condolence messages\u201d.\n\nTop sources in the PDP told The Hindu that Ms. Mufti, during her meetings with BJP stalwarts, which include Arun Jaitley in New Delhi, conveyed her \u201cdispleasure to the top BJP leadership over the progress of agenda set by the coalition in March last year\u201d.\n\n\u201cTill Mr. Mufti breathed his last, he had faith that this coalition will deliver despite the bitter experiences of the past nine month. His last query on the dead bed was about the relief money and package for displaced Pandits over which the government of India not only dragged its feet and haggled,\u201d a top PDP leader and close aide of Ms. Mufti told The Hindu . He expressed displeasure over New Delhi\u2019s failure to \u201cmake an attempt to end the triangle of hatred among Srinagar, New Delhi and Islamabad through reconciliation from Kashmir.\u201d\n\nSources said the government formation would be delayed till Ms. Mufti got guarantees from the BJP leadership in New Delhi on \u201cimplementation of the Agenda of Alliance\u201d. It is reliably learnt that several attempts on Wednesday by middle-rung leaders of the BJP to reach out to Ms. Mufti were turned down.",
