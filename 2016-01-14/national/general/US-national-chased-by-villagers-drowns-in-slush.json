He assured the House that he would get further details of the case.\n\n\u2018Police tried to help him\u2019\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Police Mapusa Mahesh Gaonkar, however, denied that Mr. Vholte was chased by the police. He claimed that the police, in fact, tried to help the American national.\n\nAccording to the information with the police, the deceased had an argument with some Nigerians in Harmal village of north coastal Goa. Running away from the Nigerians, Mr. Vholte reached Korgao village. He was resting on a scooter when some locals, believing that he was trying to steal the vehicle, ran towards him shouting. Mr. Vholte took off once again. He jumped into a roadside paddy field and was quickly pulled down when he tried to run in the slush.\n\nThe locals went to his rescue and managed to pull him out. He was rushed to a doctor, but he died on the way.\n\nMr. Gaonkar said the police too had tried to help him, but he only ran faster when he saw them. The police have registered a case of unnatural death and are awaiting the arrival of American Embassy officials for the post-mortem, a spokesperson of the police said.",
