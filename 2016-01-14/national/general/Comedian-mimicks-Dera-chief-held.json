The Dera had extended support to the BJP in the Haryana and Delhi polls. The saffron party wants to repay the Dera for its support to it in the State and also in Delhi.\n\nHowever, an immediate reason for action is also the potential law and order implications of the comedian\u2019s act of mimicking the Baba.\n\n\u201cThe stand-up comic not only made derogatory remarks against the Dera chief but also portrayed him as a womaniser, alcoholic and a money-seeking man during one of his acts,\u201d said Dera spokesperson Aditya Insaan.",
