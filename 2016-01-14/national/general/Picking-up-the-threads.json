It\u2019s exciting to work in something that I have not ventured into.\u201d\n\nWhile watching old movies, he discovered that there was \u201cso much luxury in the lifestyle of India.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was so much of respect and texture that India has...For all this dying crafts, it\u2019s important that a few of the designers get it out there in focus in their own style. I am doing it in my own style,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is another venture where we (me and my label) are focussing on various textures from Gujarat and Benaras. They have a certain regalness, royalty and a history...And that\u2019s why \u2018Regal Threads\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Malhotra, who has styled global names like Michael Jackson, Reese Witherspoon, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Campbell, said the collection was \u201cfor a bride, a girl attending a wedding and for a boy.

I was in Benaras for three days and I noticed that the weavers need a lot more work. \u201cI am doing a lot of bandhinis , which are untouched and untapped. I am glamourising it like what I did with Kashmiri embroidery. I got it in focus in bridal lehengas, evening wear and saris. That\u2019s what I want to do for Benaras and Gujarat,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u2018Regal Threads\u2019 range, which consists of saris, high-waisted skirts, lehengas and jackets, will be showcased in Mumbai\u2019s Regal Room.

It\u2019s very organic. I think Katrina and Aditya are tall, beautiful, very today, sexy and glamorous. \u201d \u2014 IANS",
