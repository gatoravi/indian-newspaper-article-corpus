Teams of NIA have been dispatched to all the border villages near the airbase to recover the clothes and any related evidence.\n\nThe NIA also suspects that when the terrorists crossed over to India through the riverine stretch in the Bamiyal sector, they were in touch with their handlers through a Chinese-made wireless set. Since the frequency of these sets is generally only along the line of sight, the NIA believes the handlers must have positioned themselves somewhere close to the border.\n\n\u201cThey [the terrorists] took internal roads of the villages to approach the Pathankot airbase. They abandoned the police officer\u2019s vehicle and went on foot for 1.5 km with heavy arms and ammunition,\u201d said the official.",
