    "text": "The Malda violence is likely to be a core issue for the BJP in West Bengal as it kicks off its campaign for the Assembly polls in the State later this year.\n\nIn Malda, which has a high Muslim concentration, a mob had attacked the Kaliachak police station recently apparently protesting an insult to the Prophet by Hindu Mahasabha\u2019s Kamlesh Tiwari.\n\nWhile many are accusing the BJP of playing communal politics on the issue, the party claims that the attack on the police station was to destroy records relating to fake currency, etc., and calls it a national security concern.\n\nThe party was planning a rally in Malda on January 18 but has had to shift the venue to Dinajpur as the State government refused permission, sources said.\n\nUnion Minister Nitin Gadkari is expected to address the Dinajpur rally.\n\nThree more rallies are tentatively slated for the month \u2014 to be addressed by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, HRD Minister Smriti Irani and party chief Amit Shah.",
