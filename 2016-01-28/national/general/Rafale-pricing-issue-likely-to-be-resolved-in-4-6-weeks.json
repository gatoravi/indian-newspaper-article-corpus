The issue of offsets has been one of the major sticking points in the negotiations which France has later agreed to.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu earlier, the effort is to bring the price by at least 20 per cent to below \u20ac 8 billion. When asked about this in the interview Mr. Richier declined to comment.\n\nOfficials said while the price had come down from that in the original Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) deal, it was still not acceptable. \u201cPrice has come down from the earlier tender but not to our expectations. Let them [French] do their exercise of costing and come back with revised terms,\u201d they said.\n\nThey added that a deal could not be concluded till India got \u201cbetter terms\u201d as announced by Mr. Modi in Paris last year.",
