The next meeting of the whole Council of Ministers is scheduled for February 10.\n\nThe Ministries that made presentations on Wednesday included Chemicals and Fertilizers, Food and Consumer Affairs, Agriculture and Rural Development. Of these, the largest number of Cabinet decisions, sources said, was in the Chemicals and Fertilizers Ministry, headed by Ananth Kumar. \u201cThere were 60-62 decisions that were examined in the presentation,\u201d said a senior official in the government.\n\nA Minister present at the meeting said that Mr. Modi was interested in knowing the reasons for not implementing certain decisions as fast as they should have been.\n\nThere was talk that this meeting was a n appraisal that may lead to a Cabinet reshuffle. \u201cAs of now, however, it seems that the meetings are a way of giving even junior Ministers some exposure on how the totality of government works and foster some team spirit,\u201d the Minister said.",
