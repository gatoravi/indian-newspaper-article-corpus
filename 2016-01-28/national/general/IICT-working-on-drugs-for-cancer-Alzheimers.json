    "text": "CSIR-Indian Institute of Technology will be filing application for Investigational New Drug (IND), a crucial step before going for clinical trials, with Drugs Controller General of India later this year for two promising molecules for cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nTalking to reporters here on Tuesday, IICT Director, Dr. S. Chandrasekhar said that the institute\u2019s scientists have been working on developing new drugs in the areas of oncology, infections and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The cancer drug would target H-DAC pathway to inhibit growth of cancer cells. It would only be the second drug in the world to use H-DAC mechanism once it gets commercialised after successful clinical trials, he added. He said IICT plans to licence the patents of the two drugs to pharma companies with a stipulation that they sell the drugs at prices fixed by IICT in India.\n\nDr. Chandrasekhar expressed the hope that the new drugs would be commercially available in another five years.\n\nEarlier former IICT Director, Dr. A.V. Rama Rao, who was awarded Padma Bhushan, was felicitated by the staff of IICT.\n\nPraising Dr. Rama Rao\u2019s qualities of head and heart, Dr. Chandrasekhar said he never shirked from societal responsibility and had a very unique way of choosing problems for Ph.D students. Former CCMB Director, Dr. D. Balasubramanian said Dr.Rama Rao not only changed the nomenclature of RRL to IICT, but also brought about a change in the attitudes and ensured that the focus was on good quality work, discoveries and patents.\n\nResponding to the felicitations, Dr. Rama Rao said his philosophy always had been that the research should have direct relevance to society.\n\n\u201cPeople should get benefit out of it,\u201d he added.",
