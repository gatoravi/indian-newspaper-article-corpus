The entire process has been video-graphed, and the body is preserved in the Government Medical College Hospital, Villupuram,\u201d the public prosecutor said.\n\nSankara Subbu, counsel for the petitioner, contended that the autopsy was conducted without the consent of the girl\u2019s parent, and this was illegal. Claiming that the petitioner had suspicions about the cause of death and the autopsy conducted, counsel prayed for a fresh post-mortem.\n\nOpposing the contentions, the public prosecutor said the autopsy already conducted could not be doubted and a re-post-mortem was not required.\n\n\u201cIf the plea is allowed, it would amount to doubting the integrity of the team of doctors which conducted the examination and would also amount to interference with the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nRefusing to accept his contentions, the judge said: \u201cIrrespective of the submissions made on either side, since the plea has been made by the father of the deceased girl \u2026 the court is of the opinion that the prayer can be considered.\u201d The judge then posted the matter to February 5 for further hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, Venkatesan, member of a fringe Dalit outfit, who was wanted by the police in connection with the death of the three students, surrendered before the Saidapet Court on Wednesday.",
