I\u2019m simply human, and as a human I think the conflict is absurd,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Colombian conflict has killed more than 220,000 people and forced six million from their homes.\n\nBut after more than three years of negotiations, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government appear to be close to a peace deal.\n\nLast week they asked the United Nations to set up an observer mission to oversee an eventual ceasefire and rebel disarmament.\n\nThe two sides have set a self-imposed deadline of March 23 to sign a final accord.\n\nThe prospect of turning the page on more than half a century stained by violence is increasingly fuelling street artists\u2019 creativity in Bogota, where graffiti is surging as an artistic medium.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor from 2012 to 2015, former guerrilla fighter Gustavo Petro, actively promoted graffiti as a public art form.\n\nThat stance helped counter the stigma of graffiti as vandalism, and giant murals sprouted up in iconic spots throughout the city.\n\nToday, visitors and fans can even take a graffiti tour, created by Australian expatriate Christian Petersen.\n\nToxicomano, a graffiti artist known for works protesting atrocities committed by the Colombian army, said the medium is well-suited to politically engaged art.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact of painting in the street is a political act,\u201d he said. \u2014 AFP",
