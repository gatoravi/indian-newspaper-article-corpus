Mehbooba wanted to meet district-level leadership to know their mind on a range of issues \u2026 Government formation will also be on the table,\u201d PDP legislator and former Education Minister Nayeem Akhtar told The Hindu .\n\nIt will be Ms. Mufti\u2019s second meeting after January 17, when senior party leaders mandated her to take the final call on government formation. A similar meeting is scheduled in Jammu in the first week of February. Last year, Sayeed carried out a similar exercise while allying with the BJP.\n\nApparently unhappy with the coalition\u2019s performance, Ms. Mufti (56), who never held a portfolio in the State, is building pressure on the BJP to spell out its assurances on the common minimum programme.\n\nThe BJP in New Delhi reportedly is in no mood to make any fresh promises. PDP insiders told The Hindu that the only way to end the logjam is to reopen a channel of communication, which was snapped after Union Minister and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari\u2019s visit to Ms. Mufti\u2019s residence on January 10.\n\n\u201cLet the PDP approach the Governor first,\u201d said BJP leader Nirmal Singh, who was the Deputy Chief Minister in the PDP-BJP government. \u201cThe Agenda of Alliance was agreed upon at the highest level [last year]. We are committed to it,\u201d he said.\n\nOmar\u2019s jibe\n\nNational Conference (NC) working president and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah took a jibe at Ms. Mufti for delaying government formation.\n\n\u201cShe [Ms. Mufti] thinks she would keep people waiting for the government and people will plead with her for it,\u201d he said.",
