This could have several implications on the future of Indian agriculture and hence, to create interest among rural youth in agriculture, there was a need to make farming more profitable.\n\nHe was addressing an event on attracting and retaining youth in agriculture organised jointly by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the All India Agriculture Students Association (AIASA) here.\n\nRealising the importance of rural youth in agricultural development, especially from the point of view of food security, the ICAR has initiated a programme on \u201cAttracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture.\u201d\n\nMr. Singh said start-up India had created an impact on non-farm sectors as many entrepreneurs started vibrant enterprises. \u201cIt is time to extend start-up India to the farm sector by replicating the success stories of enterprises in honey production, dairying and fisheries,\u201d he said, adding that to promote agri-business and to attract young farmers, the Centre was promoting formation of Farmer Producer Organisations. Capacity building and financial assistance would be provided. \u201cThis ICAR project will be implemented in 25 districts [one district from each State] through the Krishi Vigyan Kendras. Each KVK will involve about 200 youths below the age of 35.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said the government had made B.Sc. Agriculture a mandatory qualification to get licence for sale of agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. \u201cThis will create several thousand jobs for agriculture graduates,\u201d he added.",
