Doctors said that all his physical parameters were normal.\n\nThe 75-year-old politician spent three days in the hospital amid a swirl of rumours doing the rounds on the social media that posited Mr.Pawar as being \u201cin an extremely serious medical condition\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have tours lined up for the next two months without a single day off. I cannot make room for rest in my busy schedule. I hate sitting in one place for too long a while anyway,\u201d Mr.Pawar said, reacting to the doctors\u2019 suggestions that he should complete a week-long rest.\n\nMr.Pawar later tweeted the news of his \u201cgood health\u201d, expressing his gratitude to people and party activists for their concern.",
