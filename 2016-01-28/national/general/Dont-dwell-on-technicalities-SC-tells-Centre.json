    "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday saw intense arguments over imposition of President\u2019s rule in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nWhen Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi claimed that the petition filed by a Congress leader was misconceived, a five-judge Constitution Bench led by J.S. Khehar asked Mr. Rohatgi not to dwell on \u201ctechnicalities.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel Fali Nariman pitched in, saying he should look at the larger picture. Justices Dipak Misra and P.C. Ghose interceded here, and asked Mr. Rohatgi to accept notice anyway. \u201cYou are right. But do file your reply on the petition for whatever it is worth as we have already issued notice,\u201d Justice Misra said.\n\nCaught blinking in the morning when the court pulled it up for not paying the entire court fee, the Congress side bounced back by demanding the Governor to reveal the date of his report recommending proclamation of emergency.\n\nThis was meant to prove their contention that the Governor kept the Supreme Court in the dark, pushing for President\u2019s rule even as he assured it on January 14 that \u201cnothing untoward or precipitative\u201d would happen. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said this was the first time emergency had been proclaimed in a State when the court was hearing the issue.",
