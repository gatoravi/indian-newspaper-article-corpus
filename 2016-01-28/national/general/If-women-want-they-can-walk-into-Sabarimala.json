Music is a religion unto itself, says tabla maestro Zakir Hussain\n\n\u201cIf a thousand women decide to go to Sabarimala and walk in there, they can,\u201d tabla maestro Zakir Hussain has said.\n\nHe was addressing an informal interaction with presspersons ahead of a performance with Shashank Subramanyam and Rakesh Chaurasia at Nishagandhi auditorium here on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWomen are so strong that if they want to go, they can. We were taught this by Gandhiji. He didn\u2019t pick up a weapon and start fighting. He walked, and went where he needed to go even though he was told not go.\u201d\n\nMr. Hussain said that the reason people said they could not do something was that they had accepted what others had said.\n\n\u201cI was allowed inside Kashi Vishwanath temple. I also played in front of the deity at Tirupati. It was an amazing experience,\u201d he said.",
