    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of his Council of Ministers on Wednesday evening to review the implementation of the decisions of at least four Ministries, and earmarked the second Wednesday of every month for such a review of selected Ministries. The next meeting of the whole Council of Ministers is scheduled for February 10.\n\nThe Ministries that made presentations on Wednesday included Chemicals and Fertilizers, Food and Consumer Affairs, Agriculture and Rural Development. Of these, the largest number of Cabinet decisions, sources said, was in the Chemicals and Fertilizers Ministry, headed by Ananth Kumar. \u201cThere were 60-62 decisions that were examined in the presentation, and there was questioning specifically on the Gorakhpur fertilizer factory that had been earmarked for revival by the government,\u201d said a senior official in the government.\n\nA Minister present at the meeting said that Mr. Modi was interested in knowing the reasons for not implementing certain decisions as fast as they should have been. \u201cWhenever a decision was seen as having got stuck because of inter-departmental reasons, the other Ministry involved was also brought into the picture,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nThere was talk that this meeting was a kind of appraisal that may lead to a Cabinet reshuffle in the near future. \u201cAs of now, however, it seems that the meetings are a way of giving even junior Ministers some exposure on how the totality of government works and foster some team spirit,\u201d the Minister said. \u201cIt is a fact that a lot of what the government is doing is not being talked about at all. The Prime Minister told the Ministers that unless they themselves knew what various Ministries were up to, how could the people know,\u201d said a junior Minister present at the meeting. The meeting was held at the Parliament\u2019s Library Building, and dinner was also served to all the Ministers.",
