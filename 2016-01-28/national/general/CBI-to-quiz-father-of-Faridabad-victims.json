    "text": "The Central Bureau of Investigation will examine the role of the father in the death of two minor children of a Dalit family in an arson attack allegedly by some members of the Rajput community at Sun Perh village in Faridabad district of Haryana last October.\n\nJitender, the complainant, had alleged that he, along with his wife and two children, were asleep near a window when some members of the Rajput community threw petrol at them from outside and put in a burning matchstick in the early hours of October 20.\n\nWhile two-year-old Vaibhav and 10-month-old Divya were killed, their mother, Rekha, sustained serious injuries. Jitender sustained minor burns on his hands.\n\nEarlier this month, the agency conducted lie detector tests on the 11 accused in the case registered under the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Indian Penal Code.\n\nIn the court, the accused sought the lie detector test on the complainant. He has to furnish his reply on the next date of hearing on February 1.\n\n\u201cThe results of the lie detector tests on the accused are still awaited. Also, we have not yet received the final report on forensic examinations of the articles taken from the crime scene. Therefore, the agency could not file a charge sheet within the stipulated 90 days,\u201d said a CBI official, adding that the 12th accused was a juvenile.\n\nFollowing the delay in filing the charge sheet, six of the accused have already got bail.\n\nThe CBI had earlier recorded the statements of Jitender and his relatives to reconstruct the sequence of events. Central Forensic Science Laboratory officials had visited the crime scene.\n\nThe two Dalit children were set ablaze, allegedly by Rajput community members",
