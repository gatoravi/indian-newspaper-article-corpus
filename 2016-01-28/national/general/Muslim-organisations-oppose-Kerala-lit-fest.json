    "text": "A slew of Muslim organisations have urged the State government to withdraw its support to the maiden four-day Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) being held in Kozhikode from February 4, saying that the festival has an \u2018\u2018anti- Muslim attitude.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn a joint statement, they maintained that the KLF organisers had decided to hold a session on \u201cReligion, spirituality and philosophy\u201d in which the proposed speakers are known critics of religion, and religious practitioners were absent on the panel.\n\nBesides, the session was confined only to discussing Islam, the statement said, adding that such debates were not only anti-democratic but also an insult to believers.\n\nIn contrast, the other KLF sessions on poetry, literature, drama and novel had participants of known figures from those fields, it added.\n\nHowever, a KLF organiser, who did not wish to be named, said the schedules had not been finalised yet. \u201cWe are not sure how some people got such information about a particular session. Perhaps it must have been taken out of context from the festival website. A session on religion has been planned, but it will not be confined to Islam,\u201d he said.\n\nYaser Arafat, Editor of Dubai-based Pravasi Vayana and one of the signatories, said they had spoken to festival director K. Satchidanandan after seeing the website promo and the poet had given the assurance that the session would be re-scheduled accordingly.\n\nWriters Taslima Nasreen, M.T. Vasudevan Nair, Ashok Vajpeyi, Paul Zachariah, T.M. Krishna are among those who will take part in the festival.",
