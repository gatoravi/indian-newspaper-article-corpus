He has supported our movement. I request the government to act as soon as possible and do away with similar bans across the country,\u201d said Ms. Desai.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s plan to storm the temple on Republic Day was foiled owing to heavy security at the temple. More than 400 activists were detained at Supa village, some 70 km from the temple town in Maharashtra\u2019s Ahmednagar District. Following this, Mr. Fadnavis posted a conciliatory tweet on Tuesday in which he said Indian culture and Hindu religion gave women the right to pray.\n\nLocal residents continue to oppose the brigade\u2019s attempts to do away with the centuries-old tradition, with the Shani Shingnapur village Gram Sabha passing a resolution condemning Ms. Desai and fellow agitators for their repeated attempts to storm the temple \u2018chauthara\u2019 (sacred platform).\n\nThe temple authorities are silent on Mr. Fadnavis\u2019 support for the women.\n\nDiscrimination in praying is not in our culture, says Fadnavis\n\nVillage sabha passes a resolution condemning the brigade for repeated attempts to storm the temple \u2018chauthara\u2019",
