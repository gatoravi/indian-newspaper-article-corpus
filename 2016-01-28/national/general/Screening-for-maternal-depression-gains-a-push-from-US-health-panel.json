In 2009, the group said adults should be screened if clinicians have the staff to provide support and treatment; the new guidelines recommend adult screening even without such staff members, saying mental health support is now more widely available. The 2009 guidelines did not mention depression during or after pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very significant that the task force is now putting forth a recommendation that\u2019s specific to pregnant and postpartum women,\u201d said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor of public health at the University of Minnesota. \u201cPolicymakers will pay attention to it. Increased screening and detection of depression is an enormous public health need.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nThe panel gave its recommendation, which was published in the journal JAMA , a \u201cB\u201d rating, which means depression screening must be covered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor years, obstetricians and other health care providers who saw women during and after pregnancy often felt ill equipped or reluctant to ask about problems like depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n\u201cOb-gyns thought that if they identify something and don\u2019t have resources to support it, it puts them at significant legal risk,\u201d said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, the director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNo one screened Melissa Mead, 30, of The Dalles, Oregon, during or after her first pregnancy, five years ago. Shortly after her son Brady\u2019s birth, \u201cI experienced postpartum depression, anxiety and OCD,\u201d she said, and \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d\n\nMs. Mead cried constantly, barely slept, rarely left home and was \u201cscared to death that my baby was going to suffocate,\u201d she said. At her job as an optician, she said that people asked, \u201c\u2018Isn\u2019t everything so wonderful?\u2019 and I was like \u2018I kind of feel like dying on the inside,\u2019 and you don\u2019t want to say that because you\u2019re afraid what people will think of you.\u201d\n\nAfter a year, she saw a psychiatrist for talk therapy. When her second son, Emmett, was born, and she had more symptoms, including fearing that she would stab herself with a kitchen knife, Ms. Mead tried several medications until one worked. She now volunteers for Postpartum Support International.\n\nThe panel said evidence showed that cognitive behavioural therapy was helpful to mothers. It said that the use of some antidepressants during pregnancy could cause \u201cpotential serious fetal harms,\u201d but that \u201cthe likelihood of these serious harms is low.\u201d\n\nDr. Pignone also emphasized that \u201cuntreated depression has a lot of adverse consequences itself.\u201d\n\nPrenatal health\n\nAmong them, experts say, are that pregnant women with depression often take poorer care of their prenatal health. And maternal mental illness can affect children, leading to behavioural problems, emotional instability and difficulty in school.\n\nBesides citing evidence that screening accompanied by even minimal counselling helped women with depression, the panel found that screening caused no harm.\n\n\u201cA decade ago there was more concern that screening pregnant and postpartum women for mental health would do more harm than good,\u201d said Wendy N. Davis, the executive director of Postpartum Support International. \u201cMedical providers would say to me, \u2018If I screen and she screens positively for depression and anxiety, I\u2019m afraid that it will just make her feel more scared, or there\u2019s more stigma to that label.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, she said, \u201cscreening tools actually can give a language for both the providers and the patients to feel comfortable talking about it and prevent the stigma.\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
