The whole incident was over in 15 minutes,\u201d the official added.\n\n\u201cOur radars picked up a shiny flying object entering our airspace. A fighter jet was quickly scrambled which intercepted it and shot it down,\u201d Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said.\n\nThe IAF said in a statement that its radar had picked up the \u201cunidentified flying object moving easterly in the Jaisalmer area\u201d and the balloon was about three metres in diameter.\n\n\u201cDue to heightened security alert, the balloon was shot down,\u201d the statement said, and added: \u201cHowever, on analysis of the debris it was established that there was no dangerous payload.\u201d\n\nBeing the eve of Republic Day and the heightened threat perception all around, the Air Force adhered to the Standard Operating Procedure and the object was shot down.",
