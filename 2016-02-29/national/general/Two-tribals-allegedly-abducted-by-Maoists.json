This Maoist camp existed on a hillock on a hillock near Dangamati village. One Maoist had been killed in the exchange of fire that also led to seizure of large quantity of arms, ammunition, explosives and other materials of Maoist use.\n\nThe two missing Dongria tribals were residents of Dangamati and an adjoining village Khambesi, which hints that they may have been abducted by naxalites, who alleged them to be police informers. According to sources, the tribals alleged to be abducted by naxalites were Shyam Sikaka of Dangamati village and Ludu Wadeka of Khambesi. As per localites, Shyam was allegedly abducted from his home at Dangamati at wee hours by a group of persons suspected to be Maoists.\n\nLudu was among a group of Dongria tribals who had gone to a hill top to for annual three day worship of Niyamgiri hills that ended on Sunday.
