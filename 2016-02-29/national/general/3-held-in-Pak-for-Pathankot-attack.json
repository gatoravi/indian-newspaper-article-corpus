They were arrested by the CTD from a rented house near the Chand Da Qila bypass on suspicion that they were facilitators of the attack. The suspects, who denied the charges, were shifted to an undisclosed location for investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, the CTD registered a First Information Report in Gujranwala against unknown attackers. The FIR (number 06/2016) was filed under Sections 302, 324 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code, and Sections 7 and 21-I of the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nIt is not known when the three were arrested; but it is believed that they might have been arrested well before the FIR was filed, officials said.",
