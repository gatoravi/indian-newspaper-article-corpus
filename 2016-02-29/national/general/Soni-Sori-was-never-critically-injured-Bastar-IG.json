Kalluri on Sunday claimed that tribal activist and Aam Aadmi Party leader Soni Sori was never \u201ccritically injured\u201d as reported in the media.\n\nThe controversial officer, against whom Ms. Sori was trying to file a complaint of \u201cintimidation\u201d before she was attacked on February 19, also said the tribal activist was not \u201ccooperating\u201d with a three-member police team appointed by him to probe the attack.\n\n\u201cAs part of the investigation into the alleged attack on Ms. Sori, the Special Investigation Team led by IPS officer Kalyan Elesela reached the Apollo Hospitals in Sarita Vihar, New Delhi on February 27. But the SIT could not meet Ms. Sori as she has adopted a hostile approach towards the investigating team,\u201d Mr. Kalluri said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur team met the doctor who is treating Ms. Sori in New Delhi and it was found that she was never in a critical state as reported in the media. She is under treatment to prevent infection in the face and she does not require any plastic surgery. She was admitted with irritation caused due to unknown substance. The traces of that substance have been sent for forensic analysis by the police,\u201d he added.",
