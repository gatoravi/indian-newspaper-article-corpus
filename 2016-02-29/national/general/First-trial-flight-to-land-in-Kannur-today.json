    "text": "An aircraft, Code B plane of the IAF, will make a trial landing on the runway of the Kannur international airport here on Monday in the presence of the public and dignitaries, including Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and other Ministers.\n\nThe LDF in the district, however, decided to boycott the programme as part of its protest alleging corruption charges against Ministers. The LDF alleged that the trial landing had been scheduled as part of an election stunt as the project was incomplete.\n\nThe 14-seater aircraft would come from Bangalore. The aircraft made a test-flight over the project site on February 27.\n\nKIAL officials said the plane would land around 9 a.m. A makeshift control tower has been set up at the project site.",
