The case is currently being heard in the Supreme Court where recently the Union government changed its earlier stand on the minority status of the institution.\n\nActivists and AMU alumni, who have been creating awareness about the case, reminded the BJP that as part of the Janata Party, it had piloted the Bill about the minority character of AMU and later in the 1979 mid-term polls, promised \u201crestoration of the autonomy and original character of the Aligarh Muslim University\u201d in its manifesto.\n\nBahar U. Barqi, the AMU advocate who is representing the AMU Old Boys Association in the Supreme Court, said the BJP should learn from the past and support the issue of AMU\u2019s minority character.\n\n\u201cThe Janata Party government, which came to power in March 1977, piloted the AMU (Amendment) Act 1920, which proposed giving minority character to the Aligarh Muslim University. The Morarji Desai Cabinet of which Advaniji and Vajpayeeji were members, approved the Bill which was subsequently tabled in Parliament. But it could not be passed in Parliament because the Janata Party government fell in July 1979,\u201d Mr. Barqi said.\n\nMr. Barqi said that again during the 1979 mid-term Lok Sabah elections, the Janata Party reiterated its pledge on the status of the institution.\n\n\u201cNot only did the Janata Party include the promise of AMU\u2019s minority character in its manifesto, it also supported the Bill when it was moved by the then Congress government and adopted by Parliament,\u201d he added. The then BJP vice-president Ram Jethmalani and Janata Party Lok Sabha member, Subramanian Swamy, supported the Bill.",
