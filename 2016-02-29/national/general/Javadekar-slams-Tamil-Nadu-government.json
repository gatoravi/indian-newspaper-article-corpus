    "text": "Javadekar says Tamil Nadu deserves better than what it had received in the last 50 years of Dravidian rule.\n\n\u201cJust by adding Re.1 or Rs. 2 at the end cannot make it a State scheme,\u201d he said. According to him, Tamil Nadu deserved better than what it had received in the last 50 years of the Dravidian rule.\n\nThe comments are certain to touch a raw nerve given that the AIADMK government of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa has made the distribution of relief money an important achievement. Even in the Assembly, Ministers pointed to the distribution of Rs. 5,000 to the flood victims as a major accomplishment.\n\nSources in the BJP said the critical comments were probably due to the pressure applied by the DMDK. It is learnt that Mr. Vijayakant was upset at some senior BJP leaders in the State recently claiming that the BJP was ready for talks with the AIADMK.\n\nOn the meeting with Mr. Vijayakant, Mr. Javadekar said the hour-long discussion was fruitful.\n\n\u201cThere were some things discussed which I will take to my national president Amit Shah. I will be back in Chennai after the Union Budget and all NDA partners will meet the media together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister, who is in charge of the party affairs in Tamil Nadu for the Assembly elections, said the fact that he had met Mr. Vijayakant twice in a month showed that \u201cboth parties were part of the NDA.\u201d But in an official release later, the DMDK downplayed the event as a \u201ccourtesy meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, sources confirmed that the DMDK underscored the need for making Mr. Vijayakant chief ministerial candidate of the NDA, a move that needs the approval of the BJP national leadership. The DMDK is also being wooed by the DMK though there has been no development over the last two weeks.",
