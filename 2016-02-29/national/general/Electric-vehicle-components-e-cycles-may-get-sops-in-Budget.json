Because providing subsidy worth Rs. Five lakh to every farmer would be impractical, the Centre may go in for a subsidy-sharing arrangement with the States, or eliminate some of its existing ineffective incentives to ensure a fair allocation for subsidies on solar water pumps. Also, though many States were supplying power to farmers virtually free of cost, the quality of power was poor with outages and a sudden drop in voltage damaging the farmers\u2019 water pumpsets. Helping farmers with subsidies could ensure that they switch to solar water pumps, thus doing away with the need to provide free power, the sources said.",
