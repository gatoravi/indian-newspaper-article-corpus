    "text": "Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday slammed the NDA government, saying it has put development issues on the backburner and was fanning controversies which are hampering the democracy to thrive.\n\n\u201cAfter many years, a non-Congress government has come to power at the Centre by getting majority. People expected that this government will usher in development as it promised.\n\n\u201cInstead, it was fanning controversies, prompting opposition to react,\u201d Mr. Sibal said at a talk show on \u2018Constitution and Patriotism\u2019 held here.\n\n\u201cIn such an environment, democracy can\u2019t thrive...till such things are not stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to BJP leaders, the former Union minister, without taking names, said: \u201cPeople with speeches and selling dreams have come to power. But it is hard to fulfil dreams.\u201d\n\nWithout clearly referring to ongoing turmoil in JNU and Hyderabad University, he said universities were not a public place but private spaces and that the youth should be given opportunity to express.\n\n\u201cIf police will enter universities, its autonomy will end,\u201d he said.\n\nQuoting a Supreme Court judgment, he said case of sedition is not made out on mere sloganeering.\n\n\u201cIf anybody raises slogans and conspires against the State and indulges in violence, such acts amount to sedition,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senior Supreme court lawyer said nowadays communication was too fast and people learn what was going around the world and demand things instantly and that peoples\u2019 expectations from government and politicians has risen manifold, which, if not met, they take to the streets.\n\nOn the issue of reservation demands recently made by communities like Patels and Jats, he said: \u201cIt is a serious matter. Reservation cannot be ended. It will escalate trouble as due to encouragement to private sector, the government jobs are becoming scare.\u201d\n\nMr. Sibal advocated for employment generation by economic development to end the fight over reservation.\n\nHe said that he was a \u201cpatriot\u201d and India was a unique and role model for the world.\n\n\u201cEvery country is recognised by its language and culture, whereas India doesn\u2019t have one language and culture.Our constitution binds all cultures and protects all languages and cultures,\u201d Mr Sibal said.
