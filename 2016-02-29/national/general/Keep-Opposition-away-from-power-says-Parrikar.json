They have now made a lucrative business out of politics in Goa\u201d.\n\nThe Minister charged that some Opposition politicians have amassed so much wealth through dishonest dealings that they have been carrying out sustained anti-BJP campaigns using vested interests in social media, electronic media and newspapers.\n\nAsserting that some of them had been \u201crightly sent home\u201d by the people in the 2012 Assembly elections, Mr. Parrikar said others had joined them by forming more groups and parties and were exploiting the emotions of Goans over issues the exclusion of coconut tree by from the Preservation of Trees Act.",
