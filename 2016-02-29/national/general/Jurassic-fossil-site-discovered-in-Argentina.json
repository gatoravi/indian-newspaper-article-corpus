    "text": "Paleontologists in Argentina have announced the discovery of a major Jurassic-era fossil site. The site, which spans (60,000 sq. km) in Patagonia, came to light this week with the publication of a report in the journal Ameghiniana .\n\n\u201cNo other place in the world contains the same amount and diversity of Jurassic fossils,\u201d said geologist Juan Garcia Massini of the Regional Center for Scientific Research and Technology Transfer.\n\nThe fossils \u2014 between 140 and 160 million years old \u2014 lie on the surface because they were exposed by erosion, said Garcia Massini, who leads the research team.\n\n\u201cYou can see the landscape as it appeared in the Jurassic \u2014 how thermal waters, lakes and streams as well as plants and other parts of the ecosystem were distributed,\u201d he said. The fossils were preserved almost immediately, in less than a day in some cases.\n\n\u201cYou can see how fungi, cyanobacteria and worms moved when they were alive,\u201d Garcia Massini said of the site that lies along the Deseado Massif mountain range.\n\nIgnacio Escapa of the Egidio Feruglio Paleontology Museum said the researchers had found \u201ca wide range of micro and macro-organisms.\u201d\n\nThe fossils are so well preserved, that researchers say each rock extracted from the site could possibly open the door to a new discovery. \u2014 AFP\n\nThe fossils were preserved very quickly, in less than a day in some cases",
