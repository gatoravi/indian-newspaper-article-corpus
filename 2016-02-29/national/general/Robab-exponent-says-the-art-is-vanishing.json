People have lost the power of patience today and now everything comes at a price so it has turned into show business. You need patience for these kind of arts because they are meditative in a way and it takes time to understand,\u201d Sadozai said at the World Sacred Spirit Festival here.\n\n\u201cThese days, youngsters want everything immediately like fast food. It is a problem to tune the instruments as it\u2019s so difficult. It has 25 strings,\u201d he saud.\n\nHe feels lucky that when he was a student, it was peaceful in Afghanistan and at \u201cthat time, all ustads (gurus) used to live in the same neighbourhood so we learnt there.\u201d\n\nSadozai also studied the sarod, a descendent of the robab, with Ustad Amjad Ali Khan in India.\n\nAmjad Ali Khan\u2019s ancestors are said to have brought the robab from Afghanistan to India and developed the sarod.\n\nAmjad Ali Khan and his sons Amaan and Ayaan mesmerised the audience at the Sacred Spirit Festival with their soulful performance on Saturday.\n\nFolk songs were performed by the band Maati Baani. \u2014 IANS\n\nDaud Khan Sadozai says young people today lack the patience to learn the skill",
