Apart from the recent terror attacks, Mr. Mahmood\u2019s visit will give India and Bangladesh an opportunity to assess the fallout of the war crimes trial which has taken a crucial turn with the scheduled hearing of an appeal on March 8 by Mir Quasem Ali, prominent Jamaat leader, who was given the death penalty in 2015 for his role in the war crimes of 1971.\n\nEfforts are on for a bilateral dialogue between the minister and Sushma Swaraj",
