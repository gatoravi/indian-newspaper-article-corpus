The district administration had earlier cancelled arms licences of the fugitive MLA and former Labour Minister.\n\nThe three-time MLA from Nawada was suspended from the RJD after being accused of raping a school girl from Nalanda district at his residence on February 6. An FIR was registered on February 9 and the incident came to light when the central range Deputy Inspector General of Police, Shalin, found the charges true and immediately issued an arrest warrant against Yadav.\n\nThe woman who allegedly lured the girl to the MLA\u2019s residence was arrested along with her daughter, mother and a relative.\n\nThey were all sent to jail. The woman, said police, was running a sex racket in the Nalanda, Nawada and other districts.\n\nThe arrest of the absconding strongman has become a big challenge and embarrassment for the Nitish Kumar government.",
