Nepal has been hard hit by falling tourism following last April\u2019s earthquake, which killed nearly 9,000 people.\n\nThe quake triggered the April 25 avalanche which left 18 people dead at Everest base camp. It was the second in as many years, after 16 Nepali guides lost their lives on the icefall in 2014, sparking a shutdown of the peak.\n\nIce doctors, highly-skilled mountaineers, are the first men on the peak every season, using ropes and ladders to build a route across plunging crevasses and constantly shifting ice, including the dangerous Khumbu icefall.\n\nSome returned last September to prepare for the autumn season, when just a few climbers attempt the summit. But, they are needed again for the main spring season when hundreds of climbers normally take advantage of good weather conditions on the 8,848-metre mountain.\n\nMountaineering is a huge revenue earner for Himalayan Nepal, home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 peaks over 8,000 metres. \u2014 AFP",
