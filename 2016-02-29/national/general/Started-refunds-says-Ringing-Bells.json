We are refunding money to those who have paid for booking the phones and giving them an option of cash on delivery,\u201d the company Director Mohit Goel said.\n\nAbout 30,000 people have paid for booking the phones and over 7 crore people registered for it. Ringing Bells president Ashok Chaddha had explained that the manufacturing cost of the phone was about Rs. 2,500.The payment was facilitated by CCAvenue and PayU Biz. \u2014 PTI",
