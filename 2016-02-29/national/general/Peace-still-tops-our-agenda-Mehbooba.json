We joined hands [with the BJP] for the welfare of the people. That was our challenge, and will remain so.\u201d She expressed concern over the leadership crisis in the State. \u201cEveryone wants to grab the seat of power. It\u2019s the cause for the Kashmiris\u2019 suffering,\u201d she said.\n\nPraising her father Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who died on January 7, she said: \u201cMy father didn\u2019t know in which class we were studying just because he wanted to make sure every child of Kashmir went to school\u2026 He knew that the Kashmiris had suffered a lot and were not unfaithful, but were victims.\u201d\n\nLauds PM\u2019s Pak. visit\n\nShe lauded PM Narendra Modi for his visit to Pakistan. \u201cThe former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, was unable to do it in his two terms and couldn\u2019t visit his birthplace,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy father told me he wished it because peace in Kashmir was possible only when India and Pakistan came together,\u201d she said.",
