According to the report, West Bengal\u2019s Muslim community \u2014 27.01 per cent of State\u2019s population \u2014 is doing increasingly well in sending the girl child to school but the community is behind the State\u2019s average in literacy. While the State\u2019s average is 76.3 per cent of the population, the Muslim literacy rate (MLR) is 69.5. Moreover, in districts where the community is in a majority or near majority, the rate is even lower than the MLR. Districts like Uttar Dinajpur, Malda and Murshidabad \u2014 with an average of 56 per cent Muslim population \u2014 have 51.6, 58.1 and 63.2 per cent literacy rate respectively.\n\nThe 368-page report, co-produced with Association SNAP and Guidance Guild, shows that blocks with higher concentration of Muslims have lower number of schools. Blocks with over 50 per cent Muslim population (65 of 341 blocks are Muslim majority) have 4.6 \u201cgovernment-managed\u201d primary schools for every 10,000 of its population, while the State\u2019s average is 6.2. Blocks with less than 15 per cent Muslims have 7.7 \u201cgovernment-managed\u201d primary schools, which is considerably higher than the State\u2019s average. Such discrepancies can also be observed when the schools are not managed by the government.\n\nFewer teachers\n\nThese central districts of the State \u2014 Uttar Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad \u2014 where the TMC\u2019s poll performance has been at its worst, also record fewer combined secondary and higher secondary schools than the State\u2019s average. While for each lakh of population the State average is 10.6 schools, in Uttar Dinajpur, Malda and Murshidabad the figures are 6.2, 8.5 and 7.2 respectively. Blocks with larger proportion of Muslims also have fewer teachers, the report says.\n\nThese districts also have fewer colleges . \u201cTo take an example,\u201d the report says, \u201ca college in Kolkata may be expected to serve a population of 11,000 aged between 19 and 29\u201d which is much lower compared to the State average of 38,000. However, for districts with a higher Muslim percentage, \u201cthis number is at least 56,000 per college\u201d and in Uttar Dinajpur a college serves a college-going population of 76,000.\n\nDespite factors such as distance from home, \u201cmonetary problems\u201d or \u201closs of [household] income\u201d that result in lower enrolment or higher drop out rate among the minorities, the girls, at the primary level perform better than boys.\n\nThe Census 2011 figure shows that the gender gap \u2014 as in male literacy to female literacy \u2014 is considerably less among Muslims in Bengal than the overall rate. While 81.7 per cent of men are literate in Bengal compared 70.5 women, among Muslims it is 72.5 (male) to 64.8 (female). Thus, if in the overall population the gender gap is 11.2, then it is 7.7 among the Muslims, according to 2011 Census. The survey sets it at a lower rate of 4.8 and thus concludes that it \u201cdefies generally ideas about the religious orthodoxy about the Muslim families.\u201d\n\nThe survey underscores the importance and success of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for the community\u2019s achievement.",
