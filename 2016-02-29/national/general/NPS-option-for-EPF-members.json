Last year, the Budget had announced an additional Rs. 50,000 tax deduction for investments into NPS, after exhausting the Rs. 1.5-lakh limit under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act.\n\nOptional\n\nBudget 2015-16 had also promised that EPF contributions for employees below a certain threshold of monthly income, would be made optional, while employers would be required to continue their share (12 per cent of salary) of contributions. But the government hasn\u2019t yet moved on legislative amendments to bring that into effect.\n\nThe PFRDA is administered by the Finance Ministry, while the EPFO works under the control of the Labour Ministry, with the Finance Ministry having the veto power on its annual rate of return to members.\n\nConsequently, NPS accounts grew from 87 lakh in March 2015 to 1.15 crore by this month, according to PFRDA officials. However, its assets under management are Rs. 1.10 lakh crore, while the EPFO has over Rs. 10 lakh crore under its administrative control.\n\nOfficials also said that the government might allow micro, small and medium enterprises to halve the statutory EPF contributions (from 24 per cent of salary to 12 per cent) on behalf of their employees, in order to promote job creation in the formal sector.\n\nSurvey finding\n\nThe Economic Survey has pointed out that a large reason for the creation of more informal jobs even in the organised industrial sectors is the high level of statutory contributions to social security schemes like the EPF and the ESIC that reduce the take home salaries of entry-level and low-income employees and induce them to work on informal contracts instead.\n\nThe govt. is likely to announce a proposal to amend the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Act",
