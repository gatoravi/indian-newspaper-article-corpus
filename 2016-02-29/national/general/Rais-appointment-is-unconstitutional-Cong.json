    "text": "Slamming the BJP government for naming the former CAG Vinod Rai as Chairman of the new Bank Board Bureau, the Congress on Sunday said the appointment was illegal.\n\nCongress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told The Hindu that since Mr. Rai had retired as the CAG, he could not be \u201crewarded\u201d with a new government job. \u201cDoes it not violate Article 148(4) of the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Surjewala asked, adding the CAG was not eligible to take any post-retirement job under the government. In August 2014, Mr. Rai accused the UPA-II regime of pressuring him to drop some names from audit reports in the coal and Commonwealth Games scams. The statement triggered a row with the Congress questioning the integrity of Mr. Rai and the BJP seeking the details of the politicians who had asked him to do so.\n\nMr. Surjewala dug up a statement of Arun Jaitley questioning the then government\u2019s decision to assign former CAG V.K. Shunglu to head a committee to probe the CWG scam.",
