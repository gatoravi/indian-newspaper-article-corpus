    "text": "The Karimnagar police, once a role model in people-friendly policing and prevention of crime, have recently been in the news for the wrong reasons. The district is increasingly witnessing high incidence of crimes against women.\n\nIn February alone, four gruesome incidents took place in the district. A student was raped allegedly by habitual offender Dhoom Khalid and his gang.\n\nThe girl was taken to an isolated place at Bommakal on the outskirts of Karimnagar town on Sunday last. Later, there were differences within the gang, and the other members beat up Khalid who is now undergoing treatment for serious injuries in Hyderabad. The Karimnagar rural police have registered a case.\n\nOn February 18, a 30-year-old woman was raped by two persons on the outskirts of Karimnagar town. An Army jawan allegedly raped a 19-year-old girl in Madaka village of Pothkapalli police station limits of Odela mandal on February 23 when the girl was alone in her grandparents\u2019 house.\n\nA 20-year-old Dalit girl was recently gang raped in Veenavanka mandal, and the three accused \u2014 Srinivas, Anjaiah and Rakesh \u2014 filmed the assault. Though the district police have constituted SHE teams to protect women, they seem to be doing little. The women of the town say they have never seen the teams functioning.",
