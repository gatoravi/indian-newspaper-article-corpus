    "text": "Hypertensive women with physically demanding jobs are at nearly three times higher risk of ischaemic heart disease, a condition that affects blood supply to the heart, warns a study.\n\nThe combination of hypertension (commonly known as high blood pressure) and high physical activity at work increased the risk of ischaemic heart disease more than adding the individual risks together, the study said.\n\n\u201cThere is an additive interaction between hypertension and high physical activity at work. The two risk factors appear to work together, resulting in an even greater incidence of heart disease,\u201d said lead author Karen Allesoe, research student at the University of Southern Denmark.\n\n\u201cIt means hypertensive women with physically demanding work may be especially at risk of heart disease,\u201d she added. Physically demanding work causes rise in heart rate and blood pressure, which can give way to plaques in the arteries and develop atherosclerosis, a disease in which plaque made up of fat, cholesterol builds up inside the arteries.\n\nNurses with hypertension and high physical activity at work proved to be at a greater risk as both high physical activity at work and long periods of sitting increase the risk of heart disease, the findings, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, showed.\n\nNurses with normal blood pressure and high physical activity at work had a small increased risk of heart disease (about 20 per cent) but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and smoking, the researchers explained. \u2014 IANS",
