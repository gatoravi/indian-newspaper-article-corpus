Dave, said it will wait till July 20 with the \u201cunwritten hope\u201d that the government or Parliament will finalise a law on passive euthanasia, the act of withdrawing medical treatment with the deliberate intention of causing the death of a terminally-ill patient.\n\n\u201cUltimately it is whether you want a verdict from this court or a \u2018people\u2019s court's\u2019 verdict. Such issues are better decided by the people's court,\u201d Justice Kurian Joseph, one of the five-judges on the Bench, observed.\n\nOn legalising the \u2018Living Will\u2019 \u2014 an advance directive to physicians for end-of-life medical care \u2014 the Bench asked whether the concept was fundamentally against a person's instinctive urge to live.\n\nIt asked whether such a person should be given every minute chance to recover without alien intervention.\n\n\u201cYes. Look at Michael Schumacher. He is being kept alive in the hope that he will come back one day,\u201d Additional Solicitor-General P.S. Patwalia agreed with the court.\n\n\u201cI know a dying widower who saw his sons have returned from the United States and started rejuvenating on his death bed. But the sons asked the doctor \u2018how long\u2019 for their father as they had to get back,\u201d Justice Kurian said.\n\nJustice Rohinton Nariman asked whether a 90-year-old patient would still be bound by a \u2018Living Will\u2019 he made at the age of 18.\n\n\u201cA Living Will is valid if a person prepares it in his right mind when he is already a terminally ill patient and knows he has six months more to live. Such a Will is not stale. But a 90-year-old man is not bound to a Will he made when he was 18... So the narrow question is the level staleness,\u201d Justice Nariman observed.\n\n\u2018Schumacher is being kept alive\n\nin the hope that\n\nhe will come\n\nback one day\u2019",
