    "text": "With the arrest of five men, the Ghaziabad Police on Monday claimed to have finally cracked the abduction case of Snapdeal executive Dipti Sarna.\n\nSources said the conspiracy was hatched by someone known to the girl and executed with the help of a well-known criminal Devendra. The word going around is that the motive behind the abduction could be unrequited love. The police had been saying that someone very close to Dipti had planned the kidnapping and she herself had told the police earlier that the alleged abductors had told her that they were taking her to someone she knew.\n\nOn February 10, on her way from the Vaishali Metro station, Dipti was abducted by four men in an autorickshaw.\n\nThe abductors then blindfolded the girl, made her walk and took her to a sugarcane field before dropping her off at a railway station from where she took a train back home.\n\nA car used in the commission of the crime has also been purportedly recovered, said sources.",
