They were seen asking the police to ease out reporters and Mr. Kumar\u2019s supporters. First, the mob charged the atmosphere by shouting \u2018Pakistan Murdabad, Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019. The first victim was a clerk of a lawyer whom they beat up. He escaped, thanks to the intervention of a group of lawyers. Later, the rabble was seen marching around the court premises to thrash any dissenting voices.\n\nThis reporter was an eyewitness to the slapping and kicking of two print journalists when they were rushing towards the courtroom to cover the case.",
