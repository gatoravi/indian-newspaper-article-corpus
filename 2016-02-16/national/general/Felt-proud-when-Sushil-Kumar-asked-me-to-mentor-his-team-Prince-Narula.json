I felt very proud when such an experienced and respectful player like Sushil sir took my name... It was a big thing for me that he thought of me to lead his team,\u201d Prince said.\n\nPrince, who recently won Bigg Boss 9 , will be seen judging a reality show for the first time. The model says he is nervous and is not thinking of winning or losing now.\n\n\u201cYes, obviously I am nervous because I haven\u2019t chosen the team. So I don\u2019t know on what basis Sushil sir has taken them. But winning or losing will come later. I will try my best to take his team forward. Whatever experience I\u2019ve gained doing reality shows, I\u2019ll put that all in,\u201d he said.\n\nPrince started his career with modelling and finished as a second runner-up in \u201cMr Punjab 2014.\u201d\n\nThe 12th season of Roadies which he won, brought him instant fame. \u2014 PTI",
