    "text": "Congress leaders on Monday mentioned before the Supreme Court that they have learnt of a recommendation of Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa to lift the President\u2019s Rule in the State.\n\nSenior advocates Fali S Nariman and Kapil Sibal, who represent former Chief Minister Nabam Tuki, former Speaker Nabam Rebia and others, said there was a plan to swear in a new government in the State.\n\nMr. Nariman told a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice J.S. Khehar that they have filed a fresh application in this regard as there is \u201capprehension\u201d that the Centre and the Governor may go ahead with the plan.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday questioned Governor J.P. Rajkhowa\u2019s authority to concern himself with the Assembly Speaker\u2019s powers to disqualify legislators.\n\nThe Governor has no role to play in issues prescribed in the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection provision) of the Constitution, the Bench had observed.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is a basic structure of the Constitution and if some decisions are anti-democratic, it is the subject matter of judicial review,\u201d the Bench said.",
