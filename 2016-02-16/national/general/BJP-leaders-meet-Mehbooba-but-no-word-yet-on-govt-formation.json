In the wake of the killings of two civilians in Pulwama, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti kept the obeisance offering at late Sayeed\u2019s burial ground in Bijbehara town short. Ms. Mufti, accompanied by her mother Nusrat Ara, brother Tasaduq Mufti and sister Rubiaya Sayeed, briefly offered prayers at the resting place before leaving for Srinagar.\n\nIn the afternoon, top State BJP leaders, including party State president Sat Sharma, former Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh and former Forest Minister Bal Baghat, visited Ms. Mufti at her Srinagar residence. \u201cThere was no discussion on the government formation. We had gone there only to attend the 40th mourning day,\u201d said Mr. Singh.\n\nFormer Education Minister and PDP leader Nayeem Akhtar told The Hindu that \u201cthe final decision on government formation will be taken by Ms. Mufti.\u201d",
