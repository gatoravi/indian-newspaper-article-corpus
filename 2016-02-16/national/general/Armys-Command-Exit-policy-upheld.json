    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Centre\u2019s \u2018Command Exit\u2019 policy that lowered the age of commanding officers for promotions in the Army.\n\nThe policy was based on the recommendation of an expert committee set up immediately after the 1999 Kargil War to enhance operational preparedness and achieve combat peaks. \u201cThere is nothing perverse, unreasonable or unfair about the policy that lowers the age of officers serving in Combat Arms and Combat Arms Support by creating additional vacancies to be allotted on Command Exit Model,\u201d a Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justice Kurian Joseph held in a judgment on Monday.\n\nIt rejected the contentions raised by certain officers that the promotion model denied pro rata distribution of vacancies to the Service stream of the Army and focussed only on Arms and Arms Support.\n\n\u2018Laudable policy\u2019\n\n\u201cWe see no reason to allow the argument based on legitimate expectation to unsettle or undo a policy which is otherwise laudable and intended to render the Indian Army more efficient and better equipped for combat situations,\u201d the 58-page judgment said. The judgment ordered the creation of 141 additional posts of Colonel, to be allocated to \u2018Combat Support\u2019 stream to accommodate officers who are eligible for promotions.\n\nThe SC delivered the verdict on appeals by the Centre challenging the Armed Forces Tribunal\u2019s March 2, 2015 order quashing the government\u2019s January 20, 2009 policy circular.\n\nThe court pointed out that commanding officers in Japan, China and Pakistan armies got their promotions at a younger age compared to the Indian Army.",
