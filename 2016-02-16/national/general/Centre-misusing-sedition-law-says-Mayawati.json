He demanded proof for the sedition charges slapped on him by the Centre, while condemning the statements made by Home Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met the JNUSU president and found him to be a true nationalist and one who believes in democratic values. It is unfair to accuse him of sedition. Under pressure from the ABVP, the BJP is trying to impose its ideology on the JNU campus.\u201d No one could question the nationalism of the Left parties, he said.",
