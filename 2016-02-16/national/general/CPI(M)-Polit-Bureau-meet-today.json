    "text": "The CPI (M) Polit Bureau meets here on Tuesday at a time when activists in JNU, a traditional bastion of the Left movement, have been accused of shouting slogans against India and glorifying Afzal Guru, who was hanged for the Parliament attack.\n\n\u201cThe Polit Bureau will discuss the ongoing situation and the government\u2019s clampdown on student activists,\u201d CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat told The Hindu . \u201cWe are already taking up the issue in a major way. We will mobilise all secular and democratic forces. The way students who went to court for Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s hearing were assaulted and the police just watched, it is clear what is the line that has come from the Home Minister and Police Commissioner.\u201d\n\nEven as Left activists, including the JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar of the AISF, CPI (M)-ally CPI\u2019s student wing, have been booked by the Delhi Police, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury himself received threatening calls for backing the students.\n\nCPI leader D. Raja also said he received such calls.\n\nThe Polit Bureau meet, being held as per prior schedule, will be followed by a two-day Central Committee meet, where the party will discuss its tactical line at a time when West Bengal and Kerala, both crucial States for the party, go to the polls.",
