The definition itself is clear,\u201d she said.\n\nCongress leader Anand Sharma, too, defended the sedition law, saying it is a much-needed legislation in a nation-State, but cautioned against its misuse.\n\nJD(U)\u2019s KC Tyagi expressed a more nuanced view. \u201cTo involve in anti-national activities is different from sloganeering. Such slogans are certainly objectionable but not seditious. One can discuss anything. Sedition should mean commission of an anti-national act, like espionage or sharing national secrets with others,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nDP Tripathi of the NCP said: \u201cExpression of opinion is no problem. So what if one expresses one? As far as I remember, when [C N] Annadurai was speaking in Delhi about separation of Tamil Nadu from India, there were people objecting to it. But [Jawaharlal] Nehru said let him speak; it\u2019s his opinion.\u201d\n\nCPI\u2019s D. Raja said he believed that the sedition law as a colonial-era relic needed to go.",
