T-cell therapy is often considered an option of last resort.\u2014 PHOTO: AP\n\nScientists are claiming \u201cextraordinary\u201d success with engineering immune cells to target a specific type of blood cancer in their first clinical trials.\n\nAmong several dozen patients who would typically have only had months to live, early experimental trials that used the immune system\u2019s T-cells to target cancers had \u201cextraordinary results\u201d.\n\nIn one study, 94 per cent of participants with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) saw symptoms vanish completely. Patients with other blood cancers had response rates greater than 80 per cent, and more than half experienced complete remission.\n\nSpeaking at the annual meeting for the American Association for the Advancement for Science (AAAS), researcher Stanley Riddell said: \u201cThis is unprecedented in medicine, to be honest, to get response rates in this range in these very advanced patients.\u201d\n\nTo administer the T-cell therapy, doctors remove immune cells from patients, tagging them with \u201creceptor\u201d molecules that target a specific cancer, as other T-cells target the flu or infections. They then infuse the cells back in the body.\n\n\u201cThere are reasons to be optimistic, there are reasons to be pessimistic,\u201d said Mr. Riddell, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Washington State. He added that the researchers believe that lowering the dose of T-cells can reduce the risk of side-effects.\n\n\u201cThese are in-patients that have failed everything. Most of the patients in our trial would be projected to have two to five months to live,\u201d he said.\n\nEven more hopeful was researcher Chiara Bonini, who said she has not seen remission rates like those of recent trials in over 15 years.\n\n\u201cThis is really a revolution,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cT-cells are a living drug, and in particular they have the potential to persist in our body for our whole lives,\u201d she added.\n\nMs. Bonini, a haematologist at San Raffaele University in Milan, said in another study researchers had tracked the presence of \u201cmemory\u201d T-cells between two to 14 years after they had been introduced into cancer patients for whom bone marrow transplants had failed to work.\n\n\u201cT-cells are a living drug, and in particular they have the potential to persist in our body for our whole lives. This is a living therapy,\u201d Mr. Riddell said. \u201cWhen you put it in the cells will undergo expansion in vivo,\u201d he said.\n\nTests so far have only targeted certain blood cancers, and the researchers acknowledged they needed to work on tumours and track how long patients would remain in remission. Cancer cells can sometimes hide unnoticed by the body\u2019s defences, or simply overwhelm them and throw the immune system into overdrive.\n\nT-cell therapy is often considered an option of last resort because reprogramming the immune system can come with dangerous side-effects, including cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) \u2014 and overload defence cells. Twenty patients suffered symptoms of fever, hypotension and neurotoxicity due to sCRS, and two died, but the researchers noted that chemotherapy had failed in all the patients who participated in the new trials. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
