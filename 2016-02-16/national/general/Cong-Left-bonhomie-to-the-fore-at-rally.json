    "text": "As they marched a brief stretch of an arterial road in central Kolkata on Monday, the alumni of Jawaharlal Nehru University, now prominent leaders of the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), successfully gave two messages to the electorate. Under the banner \u2018#KolkataMarchesforJNU\u2019 the leaders on one hand alleged that \u201cthe BJP and the RSS are attempting to foist and foster their narrow ideology\u201d in the country and on the other presented a united face of the Congress-Left alliance to the people of the State.\n\nState Congress secretary and the rally convener, Omprakash Mishra (JNU alumnus), said \u201cthe arrest shows that freedom of speech was under attack.\u201d CPI(M) MP and JNU alumnus, Ritabrata Banerjee, said people had hit the streets in protest against the \u201cundeclared Emergency.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the rally would boost the prospect of a Left-Congress alliance, Mr. Banerjee said the march had nothing to do with politics. But he was quick to point out, \u201cThe alliance of the people is ready to oust the undemocratic Mamata government from Bengal.\u201d",
