    "text": "The sessions court in Mehsana district on Monday rejected OBC quota agitation leader Hardik Patel\u2019s bail plea in a case of rioting and assault registered against him last year.\n\nAdditional sessions judge K.M. Dave upheld government\u2019s argument that Hardik may not cooperate with the investigation if released on bail and may tamper with the evidence.\n\nThe prosecution contended that Hardik was facing separate sedition cases at Ahmedabad and Surat too, and he may try to influence the witnesses, if released. The Visnagar police took Hardik\u2019s custody on January 11 from Lajpore jail in Surat. He was lodged in the Lajpore jail for the past four months. \u2014 PTI",
