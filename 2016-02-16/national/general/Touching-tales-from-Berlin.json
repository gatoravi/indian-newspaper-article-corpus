    "text": "Two movies, both love stories, but of a different kind, make a lasting impression in Berlinale 2016\n\nSometimes, the synopsis in the festival brochure doesn\u2019t tell you the real story.\n\nTake the Israeli documentary Who\u2019s Gonna Love Me Now? , directed by the brothers Barak and Tomer Heymann. (The title refers to the first question that comes up when a gay man is diagnosed as HIV-positive.) This is the official synopsis: \u201cSinging in the London Gay Men\u2019s Chorus gives Saar the courage for reunion with his estranged family in Israel.\u201d For a while, it does seem to be Saar\u2019s story. We feel for him when he says he wishes his family had stood up for him when he was sent away from the kibbutz. (\u201cThey did not say we will leave too.\u201d). He had to go to London to find another family in the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus. And what a rainbow family it is. One of them wears a kurta-pyjama. One of them wears a kilt. Saar, of course, is seen with the yarmulke.\n\nBut the film is more than that \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t take sides. It\u2019s a deeply felt cross-generational tale of a large clan trying to come to terms with the fact that one of them is leading a life that, according to the Torah, is punishable by death. We understand (even if we do not empathise with) the sister who fears that her children might get infected, the father who wonders why Saar cannot marry a woman and still be gay, and especially the mother who says, sorrowfully, \u201cIt\u2019s awful to feel a leper is coming, and this is my son and these are my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nAt the end, this isn\u2019t a gay story. It\u2019s a family story.\n\nRifles and roses\n\nA different kind of love is manifest in Ivo M. Ferreira\u2019s Portuguese drama Cartas da Guerra (Letters from War), which narrates, in epistolary form, the experiences of Antonio Lobo Antunes (Miguel Nunes), a young doctor in the military. Antonio had to leave his pregnant wife when he was posted in Angola during the Portuguese Colonial War in the early 1970s. The details are unimportant. It could be Vietnam. It could be Afghanistan. What\u2019s important is that Antonio is a writer (he\u2019d go on to become a famous novelist), the quintessential Byronian brooder, and the screenplay, with strong echoes of Miguel Gomes\u2019s Tabu , is adapted from the letters he wrote.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get enough of the film, which has everything I love: the shadows of black-and-white cinematography, the intoxicating sweetness of ripe language (it would be fascinating to compare Antonio\u2019s novels with those of M\u00e1rquez), and the unshakeable conviction that, when in love, when in longing, there is no such thing as over-the-top.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to get the film at one viewing, simply because you keep wanting to re-read the subtitles. This is another kind of war \u2014 the beauty of words versus the beauty of images. Over visuals of barbed wire, a soldier who dies from a bullet in his back, over sounds of exploding landmines and screams of men being operated on without morphine, over images of exotic celebrations by the locals, we participate in the writer\u2019s yearning. I remember our farewell as something that took place under a general anaesthetic... Find a big bed so we can die on it together, bodies glued to each other.\n\nBut war has a way of splashing ice-cold water on the most fevered romanticism, and slowly, Antonio\u2019s tone changes. I\u2019m beginning to understand what made Che Guevara tick: there\u2019s something genuinely exciting about this, really, and even the hard, cold touch of the rifle feels nice... In the most astonishing passage, which would have been shot through intense purple filters had this film been in colour, Antonio tosses about at night, dreaming of his wife: I adore you, my January cat, my black, my white, my glass of water, my mirrored castle room, my bird on the highest evening branch, my departing ship, my sand between my fingers... Cut to the next morning: He\u2019s seeing off a patient. \u201cHere\u2019s medication for a week, and then you should be okay.\u201d Ice-cold water.\n\nWar isn\u2019t always what happens between nations, races, peoples. It\u2019s also what happens in the mind. Cartas da Guerra is the most poetic examination of the mind-altering effects of war since Apocalypse Now .",
