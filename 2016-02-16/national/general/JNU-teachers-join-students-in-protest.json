    "text": "At the Jawaharlal Nehru University on Monday, teachers joined the students\u2019 strike against the arrest of JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, signalling a further deepening of the impasse.\n\nVHP leader Sadhvi Prachi also went to JNU, but was not allowed to enter the campus. She, however, criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for supporting students accused of \u201canti-national\u201d activities. JNU has sent the HRD Ministry a report on what happened on the campus at an event in memory of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.\n\nOn the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar, Delhi Police Commissioenr B.S. Bassi said, \u201cKanhaiya was present at the event where he delivered a speech and participated in an unlawful assembly which indulged in anti-India sloganeering. It was because of his involvement, and the evidence we have collected so far, that he has been arrested under charge of sedition\u201d. He said that Kanhaiya\u2019s interrogation would be analysed for terror links and the police were looking for some other students.",
