    "text": "Adivasi women allege rape, molestation\n\nThe Congress on Monday accused the BJP government in Chhattisgarh of using \u201cgang-rapes, fake encounters and intimidation\u201d to suppress the \u201chapless\u201d tribal population and demanded a \u201cfair investigation\u201d in such cases.\n\nAt a press briefing here, senior Congress leader Ajoy Kumar said the worst-hit were Bijapur and Sukma districts. \u201cNearly 40 Adivasi [tribal] women have alleged rapes and gang-rapes by the police between October 9 and Oct. 24, 2015, and from January 11 to 14 this year at three places,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides gang-rapes, at least 15 women from Peddagelur and Chinnagelur in Bijapur have alleged intimidation by the police.\u201d\n\nHighlighting a \u201cfake encounter,\u201d Mr. Kumar said the police declared that Meena Khalkho, a tribal girl from Sarguja, was killed because she was a Maoist, but a judicial probe revealed that she was not. The most unsettling aspect, he said, was that the girl was brutally gang-raped.",
