Each MCD, however, has gone downhill from 47 rank in 2014 to 52 in 2015.\n\nIn a year-long survey, the researchers studied 476 first-tier cities with two parameters: one, how \u2018minimal\u2019 open defecation was in the city; two, how robust the municipalities were with the solid waste management system. Mysuru was found impressive on both the counts.\n\nLaunched in October 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Swachh Bharat Mission is the flagship sanitation programme of the National Democratic Alliance government, which aims to bridge the gap between sewerage and solid waste management and construct several million toilets in the urban centres.\n\nWith a Central funding of Rs.14,623 crore, the government aims to build 1.4 crore household toilets, 2.5 lakh community toilets and 2.6 lakh public toilets by 2019.\n\nThe purpose of the rankings, Mr. Venkaiah said, is to encourage cities to fix their sanitation and sewerage infrastructure by showing them the performance of other cities.\n\n\u201cCompetition makes one strive better,\u201d Mr. Venkaiah added.",
