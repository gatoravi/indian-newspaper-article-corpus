    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the 2002 hit-and-run case on the ground that corrupt means have been adopted in securing the acquittal of actor Salman Khan.\n\n\"These are all wild allegations. He must have spent Rs. 25 crore on lawyers,\" a Bench led by Justices J S Khehar remarked when the petitioner-in-person, advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, said there were news reports quoting Salim Khan that they had to spend the amount to acquit his son.\n\n\"What are the materials to substantiate this? They must have hired lawyers. How can you say that they did something wrong,\" Justice Khehar said.\n\nThe PIL had alleged that Salman and others had \"succeeded\" in manipulating the \"police and judicial system\" in the case.",
