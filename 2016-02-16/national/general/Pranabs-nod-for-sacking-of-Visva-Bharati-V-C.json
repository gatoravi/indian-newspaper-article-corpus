    "text": "President Pranab Mukherjee has approved the dismissal of Visva-Bharati Vice-Chancellor Sushanta Dattagupta, the first instance of sacking of the V-C of a Central University, HRD Ministry officials said.\n\n\u201cThe President, who is the Visitor of Central Universities, has approved the dismissal of Visva-Bharati V-C Dattagupta, as proposed by the Ministry,\u201d Ghanshyam Goel, the spokesperson for the HRD Ministry, said.\n\nEarlier this month, the HRD Ministry had sent the file to the President recommending dismissal of Mr. Dattagupta, who was facing allegations of financial and administrative irregularities, after the Law Ministry and the Attorney-General approved the procedures followed by it.\n\nThe President\u2019s office had earlier raised certain queries after which the Ministry had sought the opinion of the Law Ministry. Mr. Mukherjee had twice earlier returned the file relating to Mr. Dattagupta to the HRD Ministry, the latest in November last year, asking whether denying the V-C a \u201chearing in person\u201d on allegations levelled against him was legally tenable, triggering speculation that both were not on the same page on the matter.\n\nHowever, after the Law Ministry backed the HRD Ministry\u2019s view, the file was again sent to the President paving the way for the V-C\u2019s dismissal. Amidst reports that Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Ministry had divergent views on the issue, HRD Minister Smriti Irani had met the President recently. - PTI",
