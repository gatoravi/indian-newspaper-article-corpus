    "text": "A day after a petition was filed in the Bombay High Court seeking a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the death of actor Jiah Khan in 2013, a local court on Monday said the trial will be conducted by the state government and not the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nUnhappy with the CBI for declaring her daughter\u2019s death as a suicide and not murder, Jiah\u2019s mother Rabia Amin had moved HC seeking direction to enable the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to assist the SIT. In a parallel development, Special Judge Anju Shende said the state will conduct the trial and CBI should assist them.",
