    "text": "In their charge sheet against R.K. Pachauri, executive vice-chairman of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), the police have rebutted his claim that the messages from his mobile phone to the victim were not actually sent by him, and that the device was hacked.\n\n\u201cHowever, because the nature of conversation is continuous, such a claim doesn\u2019t hold water. We will include forensic evidence in the supplementary charge sheet,\u201d a police officer said.\n\nThe police filed the case of sexual harassment in February last year under Sections 354A (physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures), 354D (whoever follows a person and contacts, or attempts to contact such person to foster personal interaction repeatedly), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.\n\nIn her statement to the police, the victim, a former TERI employee, alleged that on multiple occasions, Mr. Pachauri had groped her and forcibly kissed her despite her opposition and she was subjected to such harassment at her workplace and even outside.\n\nWe will include forensic evidence in supplementary charge sheet, says a police officer",
