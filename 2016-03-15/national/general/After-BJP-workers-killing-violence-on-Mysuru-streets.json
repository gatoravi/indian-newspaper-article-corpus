Raju was hacked to death at a tea stall on Sunday.\n\nWhile city and suburban services were withdrawn after buses were pelted with stones near the suburban bus stand, the police resorted to lathi charge near the Mandi police station to disperse a mob proceeding towards the communally sensitive Sawdey Road.\n\nProtesters entered Devaraja Market and ransacked fruit and vegetable stalls that remained open during the bandh after entering into an altercation with traders. While a car and a police van were also stoned, a two-wheeler and an autorickshaw were set ablaze.\n\nThere was tension at K.R. Hospital mortuary, where the post-mortem was conducted, as a large crowd had gathered demanding compensation for the next of kin of Raju and the arrest of the culprits. The protesters claimed Raju had sought police protection six months ago perceiving a threat to his life, but no security was provided.\n\nBJP leaders, including Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and C.T. Ravi, MLA, held a meeting with Deputy Commissioner C. Shikha, who later announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased.\n\nShops closed forcibly, KSRTC buses damaged; police resort to lathi charge",
