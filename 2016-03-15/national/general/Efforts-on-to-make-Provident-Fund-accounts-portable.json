    "text": "In an attempt to make provident fund accounts portable in view of the growing mobility of labour, the government has directed factory inspectors to link the Aadhaar or PAN number of workers with the Universal Account Numbers (UAN) assigned to their PF account.\n\nCentral Provident Fund Commissioner V.P. Joy has written to all the regional commissioners in this regard.\n\nThe UAN facility allows workers to transfer their provident fund deposits easily while switching jobs anywhere in India. However, in order to do so, linking UAN with bank accounts and either Aadhaar or PAN details is mandatory.\n\nSo far, only 17 per cent of the total 6.36 crore UAN accounts have become portable.",
