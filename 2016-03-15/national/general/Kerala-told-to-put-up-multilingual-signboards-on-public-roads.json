    "text": "The Kerala State Human Rights Commission on Monday ordered the Public Works Department (PWD) to set aside funds for putting up multilingual direction boards on public roads.\n\nIn his order, KSHRC member K. Mohan Kumar said there seemed to be substance in a public interest petition that pointed out that travellers were often led astray due to the absence of signboards.\n\nA large segment of travellers were persons from outside the State.\n\nThe government had submitted that it had allocated Rs. 6.1 crore to put up multilingual signboards along important thoroughfares.\n\nIt would require more than Rs. 1,000 crore to put them up at all important junctions.\n\nThe commission said direction boards indicating the way to railway stations, airports and bus stands and terminals should be put up at the earliest.\n\nAll pilgrim centres should be covered, it said.",
