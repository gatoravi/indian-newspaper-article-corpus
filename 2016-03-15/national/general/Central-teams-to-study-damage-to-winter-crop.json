The current spell of rain and hailstorms in parts of Rajasthan has also threatened the mustard crop.\n\nR.K. Gupta, Director at the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR), told The Hindu that it was too early to assess the damage. However, on a conservative side, the wheat crop might have been damaged in five per cent of the total sown area in these northern States. Wheat has been sown on around 29 million hectares this season across the country and out of this, around half the wheat is sown in the northern and western States.\n\nMeanwhile, an Agriculture Ministry official said: \u201cWe are monitoring the situation and our teams have already left to asses the crop loss. It would be only after the reports are submitted by these teams that an actual assessment of damage could be figured out.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntimely rain, hail and strong winds have flattened standing wheat crop. This would certainly reduce yield and affect quality as well,\u201d senior agriculture expert and Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser P.S. Rangi told The Hindu .",
