    "text": "Approved as Money Bill in the Lok Sabha, it is well on its way to becoming a law\n\nThe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 is well on its way to becoming a law. The 14-day period between tabling a Money Bill in the Rajya Sabha and it being considered as cleared by both Houses of Parliament has started as far as the Aadhaar Bill is concerned, despite strong protests from the Opposition.\n\nThe secretary general of the Rajya Sabha, Shumsher K. Sheriff, tabled the message received from the Lok Sabha of the Bill having cleared the Lower House. The Opposition had protested its terming as a Money Bill since it would then be immune to scrutiny by the Rajya Sabha.\n\nA Money Bill, once tabled in the Rajya Sabha can be deemed as passed even if no discussion on it takes place there.",
