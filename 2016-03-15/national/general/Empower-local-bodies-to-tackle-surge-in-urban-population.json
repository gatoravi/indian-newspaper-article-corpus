Since the schemes claim to empower municipalities, he said, they \u201cwill not be capable of bridging the (country\u2019s) urban infrastructure gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe estimates made about three years back suggests that India will need a trillion dollars, that\u2019s about Rs 40 lakh crore, to fund the urban infrastructure deficit over 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Viswanathan, adding that Smart City Mission and AMRUT only add a \u201cfew thousand crores\u201d to urban planning.\n\nIn the Jaanagraha survey, all Indian cities fare badly with a score ranging between 2 and 4, compared to benchmark cities London and New York, which have a score of 10.\n\nThe study suggests that financial instability, frequent administrative reshuffles, inadequate human resources, high budget variance, poor track record of generating and releasing data are the main factors that hamper India\u2019s urban progress.\n\nMr. Viswanathan said since 40 per cent of municipal posts were vacant in most States, it was hard to imagine mayors and commissioners formulating meaningful urban plans. The poor expertise at municipality level, he said, also discouraged private investors.\n\n\u201cTo manage the relationship between investments and outcome, we need systems to track where the money is going. With today\u2019s technology, it is easy to geo-code projects at a city level and figure out where the money is being spent,\u201d he said.\n\nWith that level of transparency, Mr. Viswanathan said, the Central and State money could be spent effectively, which could also attract private investors toward municipal projects. However, all that would be possible, he said, if the State governments amended the Municipal Corporation Act and empowered urban local bodies.",
