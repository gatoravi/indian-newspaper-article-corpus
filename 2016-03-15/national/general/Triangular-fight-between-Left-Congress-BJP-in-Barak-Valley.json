Silchar, itself an Assembly constituency, is the nerve centre of the region.\n\nSix Left parties would field candidates in 58 Assembly constituencies in Assam, including some seats in Barak Valley region, said Bijan Dhar, a member of the central committee of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M). The other five parties are Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Revolutionary Communist Party of India, Forward Bloc, and Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n\n\u201cThe Left parties would contest against both ruling Congress and the BJP. They would highlight 15 years of misgovernance in Assam by the Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CPI-M would contest elections in 19 constituencies in Assam, including the crucial Silchar seat where it has fielded its trade union leader Supriya Bhattacharjee, he said.\n\nSilchar, along with Karimganj North and Karimganj South, has a close political association with the adjoining Left-ruled Tripura.\n\nThe BJP has re-nominated for the Silchar constituency sitting legislator Dilip Kumar Paul who bagged the seat in 2014 by-elections.\n\nThe Congress is yet to select its nominee from five contenders: party general secretary Rajesh Deb, former district president Arun Dutta Majumdar, former union minister Santosh Monhan Dev\u2019s wife Bithika Dev, his daughter Bharati Dev, and former chairman of Silchar municipal board Tamal Banik, sources said.\n\n\u201cCentral leadership wants to win Silchar seat. The party will field a strong candidate here,\u201d Lok Sabha member from Silchar Sushmita Dev said.\n\nSushmita is another daughter of Santosh Monhan Dev who held the Assembly seat before being elected for the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe CPI-M had last won the seat in 1978. Since that time, Congress and BJP won the seat four times each. \u2014 IANS",
