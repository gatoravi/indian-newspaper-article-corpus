This is over and above the 40 to 50 patients who undergo treatment at the institute.\n\nDoctors attribute this rise in people seeking medical help to increased awareness on the disorder, which at its worst can drastically alter behaviour patterns.\n\n\u201cWorldwide, the prevalence of OCD is two to three per cent, and it is the same in our country,\u201d says Y.C. Janardhan Reddy, chief of OCD clinic at the Department of Psychiatry at Nimhans. \u201cTwo decades ago, people seeking treatment for the disorder was rare, but nowadays more people are coming forward especially to our Bengaluru facility. But there is still need for extensive awareness to kill taboo towards the disorder.\u201d\n\nBut OCD is much more than a need to tidy up. It is, as doctors call it, a malfunction of the brain circuitry that has to be treated through medication, therapy, or a combination of both.\n\n\u20188 new persons seek treatment for many forms of the disorder every week\u2019",
