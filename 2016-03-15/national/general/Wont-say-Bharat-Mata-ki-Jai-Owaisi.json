    "text": "Rejecting RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat\u2019s suggestion for infusing patriotism, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has said he will not chant \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 even if a knife is put to his throat, prompting Shiv Sena to tell him on Monday that he should go to Pakistan.\n\nMr. Owaisi\u2019s assertion days after Mr. Bhagwat said the new generation needed to be taught to chant slogans hailing mother India drew sharp condemnation from the RSS, the BJP and the Shiv Sena, while he stood by his statement made at a public rally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t chant that slogan. What are you going to do, Bhagwat sahab,\u201d the Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad said at the rally in Udgir tehsil of Latur district in Maharashtra on Sunday.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the Constitution it says that one should say: \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nOn March 3, Mr. Bhagwat had said the new generation needed to be taught to chant slogans hailing mother India, comments which came against the backdrop of the row over alleged anti-India sloganeering on the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus.\n\n\u201cNow the time has come when we have to tell the new generation to chant \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 (hail mother India). It should be real, spontaneous and part of all-round development of the youth,\u201d the RSS chief had said.\n\nAsked by reporters to comment on the condemnation of his statement, Mr. Owaisi said he stood by it, asserting there was no violation of any law or Constitution in what he said. \u2014 PTI",
