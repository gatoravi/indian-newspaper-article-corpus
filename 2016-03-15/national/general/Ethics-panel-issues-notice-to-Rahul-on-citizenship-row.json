    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has been issued a notice by the Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha, chaired by BJP leader L.K. Advani seeking his response to allegations related to his citizenship in the U.K.\n\nMr. Gandhi said that he would \u201cdeal with\u201d the notice once it is served on him, while Congress leaders accused the government of trying to divert attention from other issues.\n\n\u201cA person who is born in India and whose grandmother and father have been Prime Ministers of India, can that person be a citizen of some other country. The Ethics Committee should dismiss it,\u201d said AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh.\n\nBJP MP Mahesh Girri had written to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan requesting an \u201cappropriate enquiry\u201d on the matter, which Ms. Mahajan had forwarded to the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Supreme Court had in November last year rejected a plea seeking a CBI inquiry into the allegations against Mr. Gandhi and questioned the \u201cauthenticity of the document\u201d attached with the PIL and the manner in which the papers were procured.",
