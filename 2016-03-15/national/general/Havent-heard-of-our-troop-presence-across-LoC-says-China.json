We believe it is an issue between India and Pakistan left over from history and should be properly handled by the two sides through dialogue and consultation,\u201d Mr. Kang said. Responding to a question on the movement of Chinese forces across the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Mr. Kang said \u201cit is learnt that China\u2019s border troops were carrying out normal patrols on the Chinese side of the LAC\u201d.\n\nSlams media\n\n\u201cThere is no such a thing as \u2018border crossing\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kang slammed \u201csome media\u201d of having \u201ctwisted the fact and hyped up the China-India boundary question\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret that. At present, China-India relations are enjoying a sound momentum of development. Friendly cooperation represents the mainstream of the public opinion in the two countries. It is hoped that the relevant media can describe the situation along the China-India border as it is and do more to promote China-India friendship, mutual trust and bilateral ties,\u201d he said.\n\nAn article in the State-run Global Times on Monday noted that \u201cseveral Indian media outlets claimed on Sunday that Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops have \u2018transgressed\u2019 the Line of Actual Control on the Pakistani side of Kashmir, passing nearly six kilometres inside Indian territory.\u201d\n\nThe article said: \u201cIndian media have repeatedly hyped up similar incidents, citing information from unnamed sources. There are divergences between Beijing and New Delhi over the border line, especially over the Line of Actual Control. Both China and India are well aware of it. Therefore, in order to avoid conflicts, both countries have agreed to take turns to patrol the area to stagger the chances of encountering one another.\u201d\n\n\u2018No evidence\u2019\n\nThe daily observed that there \u201cis no evidence to prove India\u2019s claim of the latest incident. But Indian media is inclined to make a fuss over such issues, and often use words like \u2018transgression\u2019 or \u2018incursion\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chinese foreign ministry has repeatedly reiterated that Chinese troops have been patrolling on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control and have never trespassed over the line. On the other hand, it is reported that India has raised planning of infrastructural constructions in controversial areas, and carried out aggressive patrols in the disputed border regions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Indian media is irresponsibly creating an image of China. Instead of poisoning the public opinion, the Indian media should ponder what will happen to bilateral ties if Chinese media depicts India in the same way. The truth is that not a single gunshot has been fired near the Sino-Indian border over the years,\u201d the Global Times article observed.",
