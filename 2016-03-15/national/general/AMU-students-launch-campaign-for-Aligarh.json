    "text": "Students and faculty members of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), along with the residents of Meerut, launched a campaign on Monday saying the local administration should ensure that the critically acclaimed film Aligarh is shown in cinemas.\n\nThe film could not be screened in Aligarh, reportedly due to the anti-film stance taken by some fringe groups who believed that the film \u201cdefamed\u201d the city.\n\nThe campaign, #AligarhinAligarh, is led by a group of young women students of AMU. The campaign \u2014 which first started online \u2014 has now been taken to the streets. The group behind it has managed to get signatures of hundreds of residents as well.\n\nA Ph.D. scholar of AMU, Fizza Husain, who is a member of the campaign group, explained the rationale behind #AligarhinAligarh.\n\n\u201cI felt the ban was unnecessary because all of us have the right to watch what we want. At no point did I feel that the movie has defamed the city. It is a story of the struggle of Professor Siras, which needs to be told and watched,\u201d Mr. Husain said.",
