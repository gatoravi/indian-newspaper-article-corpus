The group first opened heavy fire at a CRPF bus on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway near Sempora, injuring around nine personnel, and a splinter group of three militants stormed the multi-storey Entrepreneur Development Institute, killing two special forces officers.\n\nConfirming to The Hindu about Dujana\u2019s role, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Syed Javaid Mujtaba Gillani, said: \u201cDujana is behind the attack. We have been able to identify how the militants were ferried from north Kashmir to south Kashmir in February. He has been behind several big attacks in the Valley since 2011.\u201d\n\nThe police ruled out that the group comprised fresh infiltrators. These LeT militants had crossed the Line of Control in October last year. They were suspected to have engaged the Army in Bandipora in more than two encounters, said Mr. Gillani.\n\nA cash reward of Rs. 8 lakh had been announced to nab Dujana.",
