The canal was to carry Haryana\u2019s share of Ravi-Beas waters.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent its neighbouring States from getting share from Punjab\u2019s river waters, the State assembly unanimously passed a bill against the construction of SYL canal, providing transfer of proprietary rights back to the land owners free of cost.\n\nLeader of House and Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal moved the \u2018Punjab Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal land (transfer of proprietary right) Bill\u2019 with the objective \u201cto provide for transfer of proprietary rights to the land owners from whom the land was acquired by the state government for the construction of SYL.\u201d\n\nMoving the Bill, Mr. Badal said: \u201cThe Bill had been taken on priority basis as Punjab had no surplus waters to share it with other States.\u201d\n\nHe said that a water crisis existed in Punjab and \u201cif a drop of water flow to other states from rivers of Punjab it will be very dangerous for the State.\u201d - PTI",
