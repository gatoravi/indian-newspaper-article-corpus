It is a fight of perspectives. We are against the narrow fundamentalist mindset, whether it is of a Hindu, Sikh or Muslim. We oppose and reject the forces that are destroying the Muslim nations. We protest against the IS type of forces in the same measure as we oppose outfits like the RSS,\u201d he had said.\n\nUnion Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi raised the issue and said the Congress must apologise for Mr. Azad\u2019s statement. The comparison of the RSS with the IS was the \u201cgreat old party\u2019s grand new secular formula,\u201d he said.\n\nBiggest threat: Jaitley\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said: \u201cNothing is a bigger threat to the world currently than the IS. It is using tanks and armies against other religions. It offers instructions on how to rape women. To suggest it is like another organisation gives it respectability, this is what you have done, perhaps inadvertently.\u201d",
