Shankar. He had married a girl belonging to a higher caste last year.\n\nThe NHRC has issued notices to the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary and Director-General of Police, calling for a report in the matter within four weeks. The Commission observed that the incident had raised serious questions about the safety of those belonging to the so-called lower castes in the country.\n\nAs the youth, belonging to a Scheduled Caste, had married caste Hindu girl, the matter was known to the police. However, the police failed to provide adequate security to the couple, observed the Commission.",
