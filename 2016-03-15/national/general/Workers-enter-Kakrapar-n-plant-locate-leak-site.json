A plant emergency was declared.\n\nS.A. Bhardwaj, Chairman, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), told The Hindu on Monday that plant personnel entered the reactor building of the first unit late on March 12 \u201cafter verifying the radiation field and they have identified where the leak occurred.\u201d The personnel were working inside the reactor building and would prepare plans and procedures [on how to stem the leak]. \u201cWhatever water has come out is being re-circulated,\u201d Mr. Bhardwaj said. The AERB team, which went to Kakrapar to study the situation, had returned to Mumbai with data, the AERB Chairman said. Mr. Bhardwaj added: \u201cThe situation is perfectly safe and people are working inside. There is no disturbance. Everything is safe. Nobody has been exposed [to radiation] inside and outside the plant. That is confirmed.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, N. Nagaich, Director (Human Resources), NPCIL, said the plant personnel, who had entered the reactor building, were \u201cnormalising the systems one after the other.\u201d The reactor was under cold shutdown now.\n\nAsked whether it was a big leak of heavy water, Mr. Nagaich said it was a \u2018small leak.\u2019 \u201cWhatever has come out ... it is a small leak.\u201d The reactor used an inventory of about 75 tonnes of heavy water. The leaked heavy water had mixed with about 2,500 tonnes of ordinary/light water from the suppression pool, which was used to cool the nuclear fuel core. \u201cThis degraded water is being circulated in the reactor now ... When everything normalises, we will recharge fresh heavy water in the reactor by upgrading the heavy water in the upgraders at the site,\u201d Mr. Nagaich said.",
