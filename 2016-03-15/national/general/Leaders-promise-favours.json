    "text": "One of the producers of the sting video which allegedly shows Trinamool leaders and a senior police officer taking cash, while promising favours, said the operation was not related to coming elections in the State.\n\n\u201cThe sting has nothing to do with the West Bengal polls,\u201d Mathew Samuel later told a Bengali news channel. So far no media organisation or the Opposition has claimed to have verified the authenticity of the video.\n\nIn the first segment, Md. Ahmed Mirza, former police chief of Bardhaman district, who claims in the video to be a trusted aide of Trinamool vice-president Mukul Roy, is \u2018shown\u2019 accepting money. He claims to have arranged \u201c60 lakh\u201d for Mr. Roy.\n\nIn a different shot, Mr. Roy is seen telling the conduit and the Narada News reporter to \u201cgo immediately\u201d to \u201cmy SP Mirza\u201d to pay the cash. It is not clear from the footage whether Mr. Roy is doing any favour to the fictitious firm, Impex Consultancy. He is not seen accepting money directly from anyone.\n\n\u201cI am not taking it straightaway,\u201d he says and instructs that the money be delivered to his office on Elgin Road in central Kolkata. In a press conference, Mr. Roy later challenged the content and denied his involvement.\n\nThe footage however, purportedly shows other leaders, including senior State Ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Madan Mitra, taking bundles of cash. Mr. Mukherjee allegedly took Rs. 4 lakh, says an off-screen voice.\n\nMr. Mitra is \u2018seen\u2019 reclining on a bed while a hand from the right hand corner of the screen places many bundles of currency notes in front of him. Mr. Mitra watches from the corner of his eyes. After the entire amount is placed in front of him, he is seen picking up the money and passing it to his aide, telling him \u201cKeep the money aside.\u201d Mr. Mitra is presently in jail for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore Saradha scam.\n\nThe other important leader who is \u2018seen\u2019 taking a few bundles is the mayor of Kolkata Corporation, Sovan Chatterjee. Mr. Chatterjee is heard promising to introduce the team from the fictitious company to important power centres \u201cafter the election.\u201d",
