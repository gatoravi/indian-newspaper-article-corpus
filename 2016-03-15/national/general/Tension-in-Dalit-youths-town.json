Shankar, 22, a Dalit student who had married Kausalya, a caste-Hindu girl, on Sunday.\n\nSuperintendent of Police Saroj Kumar Thakur said the teams would comb the area.\n\nPolice sources initially said one suspect each was picked up by the Tirupur and Dindigul police, and both were being questioned. By evening, the sources said a few more suspects had been picked up from different localities.\n\nOn Monday, tension prevailed in Komaralingam, the town near Udumalpet, from where Shankar hailed.\n\nRelatives of Shankar and people from the locality blocked the road for almost four hours, demanding Rs. 10 lakh in compensation to his family and a government job for Kausalya.\n\nIn the evening, activists attached to the Untouchability Movement staged a similar agitation in Udumalpet. Some people threw stones at a few shops in Komaralingam in the morning when the shop owners did not down shutters as a mark of respect to Shankar.",
