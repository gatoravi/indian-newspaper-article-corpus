    "text": "Setting of a political furore, a 24-minute video of a sting operation, was released by a news portal on Monday, purportedly showing 11 senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders and a senior police officer, close to the leaders, promising favours and accepting wads of currency notes from representatives of a fictitious firm.\n\nThe TMC has called the footage a \u201cmanufactured video\u201d and threatened to go to court while the opposition demanded the resignation of the TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee, though she does not feature in the footage.\n\nThe sting operation conducted by the news portal Narada News released a finely crafted video called \u2018X Files\u2019 on its website. It shows nearly all the top leaders of the TMC \u2014 including party vice president Mukul Roy, three Cabinet Ministers and six sitting MPs \u2014 accepting money from a person, who claims to have come to Kolkata from Chennai, for favours to a fictitious company, Impex Consultancy. The money ranges from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh. Within minutes, the video had gone viral on social media.\n\nThe producers of the video, well known journalist and former Managing Editor of Tehelka magazine, Mathew Samuel and Angel Abraham, claim that they started making the sting-video more than two years back.\n\nIn the first segment, Md. Ahmed Mirza, former police chief of Bardhaman district, who claims in the video to be a trusted aide of Mr Roy, is shown accepting money.\n\nIn a different shot, Mr. Roy is seen telling the conduit and the Narada News reporter to \u201cgo immediately\u201d to \u201cmy SP Mirza\u201d to pay the cash.\n\nIn another shot, however, he is seen instructing them to pay the money \u201cdirectly to his office.\u201d",
