Balakrishnan, in \u2018benami\u2019 property transactions involving his relatives, the Supreme Court on Monday asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi to submit a detailed chart of Income Tax assessments and orders concerning the former top judge\u2019s family members.\n\nA Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra sought the income details of Justice (retired) Balakrishnan's relatives despite Mr. Rohatgi's submissions that they were individual assesses who had already been subjected to Income Tax screening.\n\nBut the Bench insisted, asking Mr. Rohatgi to hand over to the court the necessary details \u201cregardless\u201d of any such screenings in the past. The case was then posted for hearing to July 12.\n\nThe period under scanner concerns Justice Balakrishnan\u2019s tenure as Chief Justice of India between January 2007 and May 2010. He later went on to complete a five-year tenure as the National Human Rights Commission Chairperson in May last year.\n\n\u2018Dangerous precedent\u2019\n\nIn November 2015, Mr. Rohatgi argued that enquiries against a former CJI would set a \u201cvery dangerous precedent\u201d.\n\nHowever the court had been sceptical. Justice Misra had remarked that if a person who earns Rs. 100 buys properties worth Rs. 10 lakh, the source of the money should be investigated.\u201d",
