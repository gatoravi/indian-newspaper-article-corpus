    "text": "Scientists now believe that they have come a step closer to one of the greatest mysteries of the world, Bermuda Triangle, which swallows aircraft and ships. This belief has been established with the discovery of a series of underwater craters at the bottom of the Barents Sea, off the coast of Norway, reports News.com.au.\n\nWhile the location is not close to the Bermuda Triangle, which stretches from Florida to Puerto Rico and the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda, it is hoped that the craters are the key for explaining the bewildered phenomenon.\n\nThe craters, measured up to 800m wide and 45m deep, are believed to have been created by methane building up in sediments on the sea floor of the gas-rich Norway coast, which then leak, \u201cpopping\u201d through the sea bed and into the water above.\n\nAccording to a scientist, the crater areas represent one of the largest hot spots for shallow marine methane release in the Arctic, which creates enormous blowouts of gas bubbles, leading to sinking of ships.\n\nLast year, this possibility was explored by a scientist, who said the Bermuda Triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions. \u2014 ANI",
