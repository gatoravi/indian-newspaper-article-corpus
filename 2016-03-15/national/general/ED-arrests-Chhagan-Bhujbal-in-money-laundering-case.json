    "text": "Senior NCP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal was on Monday arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case related to new Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi. The arrest, under Section 19 (1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, came after more than ten hours of sustained questioning.\n\n\u201cThere were clear indications of the money being routed through companies belonging to the family and other facts pointed to his involvement. However, despite more than ten hours of questioning, he was not at all cooperating with the investigations. The need for custodial interrogation was hence felt,\u201d a source told The Hindu.\n\nThe ED has for over a year been investigating the routing of money allegedly received as kickbacks in exchange for awarding choice government construction projects to select contractors through companies owned by the family. The companies are owned by Mr. Bhujbal\u2019s son Pankaj and nephew Sameer, who is already under arrest. Mr. Bhujbal reached the ED office around 11.30 a.m., accompanied by a large group of party workers and supporters. The Bhujbal family has been under the scanner since early last year, first by the Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau and then the ED.\n\nHeld under PMLA, officer finds him \u2018uncooperative\u2019 after 10 hours of questioning",
