Palestine won. All 10 of us have the power, we can change the world,\u201d said Ms. Hroub, who is in her early 40s, as her name was announced by Pope Francis via video link.\n\nPlay and learn\n\nMs. Hroub runs the Samiha Khalil High School in al-Bireh, Palestine, where she uses a special approach she developed herself detailed in her book \u2018We Play and Learn\u2019 to overcome tense environments of the region under the shadow of the Israel-Palestine conflict. \u201cI am proud to present to you the message of teachers of Palestine: There is no doubt that we live in unnatural conditions.\n\n\u201cViolence and Israeli occupation surrounds us from all sides and imposes itself and leaks to each corner of educational process and its components, so our task is complicated as we see daily the suffering in the eyes of our students and our teachers. We want our children to live peacefully, as all children of the world,\u201d she said, in her part-English and part-Arabic acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cA child has the right to play. Part of education is to teach children how to play because you learn how to be social through games as well as learn the joy of life,\u201d Pope Francis said, in reference to the winning candidate.\n\nMs. Hroub\u2019s approach has led to a decline in violent behaviour in schools where this was a frequent occurrence and she has inspired her colleagues to review the way they teach and their classroom management strategies.\n\n\u201cI suggest that this year is the year of the Palestinian teacher. The world should support us to achieve hope for justice and peace,\u201d Ms. Hroub said.\n\nThe Global Teacher Prize, now in its second year, was set up by Kerala-born entrepreneur and educational philanthropist Sunny Varkey to recognise an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in society.\n\nHollywood stars Matthew McConaughey and Salma Hayek and Bollywood stars Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra joined former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai, at the gala awards ceremony in Dubai. \u2014 PTI",
