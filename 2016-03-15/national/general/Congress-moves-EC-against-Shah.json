    "text": "Congress on Monday lodged a complaint against the BJP president Amit Shah at Election Commission of India, accusing Mr. Shah of violating the model code of conduct by making \u201cdefamatory\u201d statements against its party vice-president Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIn a memorandum to EC, Congress lawyer K.C. Mittal said that since Mr. Shah has wrongly attacked Mr. Gandhi for supporting anti-India slogans that were allegedly raised on JNU campus on February 9, the remarks could \u201cmislead\u201d voters in the poll-bound States. \u201cSuch malicious and defamatory statements have been intentionally made at a time when poll exercise has commenced in five States,\u201d the memorandum said.\n\nAs per Congress, the statement was made the day after the election dates for Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry were announced on March 4. Since the model code of conduct was applicable right from the day election dates were announced, Congress asked the EC to take a \u201cstern action\u201d against Mr. Shah.",
