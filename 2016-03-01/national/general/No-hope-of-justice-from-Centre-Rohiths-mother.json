This exposes their anti-Dalit mindset,\u201d the BSP said, quoting Ms. Radhika.\n\nThe BJP government, and in particular, HRD Minister Smriti Irani, tried to \u201cmislead the people by giving incorrect statements in both Houses of Parliament,\u201d she said. Rohith\u2019s family thanked the BSP supremo for demanding that a Dalit be included in the panel probing his suicide. By rejecting this demand, the Centre\u2019s intention was exposed, she said.",
