    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday admitted a petition filed by a woman to declare the practice of triple talaq, nikah halala (bar against remarriage with divorced husband without an intervening marriage with another man) and polygamy under Muslim personal laws as illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of the rights to equality, dignity, life and freedom of religion under the Constitution. A Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave and A.K. Goel issued notice to the Centre on the petition filed by Shayara Bano, who introduced herself in the petition as a \u201cMuslim citizen whose husband has attempted to illegally divorce her after frequently subjecting her to cruelty during the currency of their marriage\u201d.\n\nMs. Bano, through senior advocate Amit Singh Chadha and advocate Balaji Srinivasan, said she only wished to \u201csecure a life of dignity, unmarred by discrimination on the basis of gender or religion.\n\nPolygamy has\n\nbeen recognised\n\nas injurious\n\nto public morals, says the petition",
