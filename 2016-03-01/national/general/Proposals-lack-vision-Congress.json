Chidambaram slammed the Union Budget 2016-17 as having \u201cno vision.\u201d\n\nDr. Singh said the announcement by the government that it would double the farm income in five years was an \u201cimpossible dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a nit-picking budget. There is no big idea except one that was mentioned yesterday [on Sunday] by the Prime Minister himself that the government plans to double the farmers\u2019 income in the next five years,\u201d Dr. Singh said. Mr. Gandhi called out the government for large allocations to the MGNREGS. Mr. Chidambaram said the budget turned out to be an \u201caccounting exercise\u201d rather than a road map for the economy. \u201cThere is no major relief to the taxpayer or the middle class or the small and medium businesspersons,\u201d he added. Speaking of agriculture, Mr. Chidambaram expressed his happiness that the UPA schemes were being continued, but urged a caution over the price rise.",
