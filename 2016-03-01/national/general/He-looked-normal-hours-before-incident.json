    "text": "Altaf Warekar, cousin of Thane mass murder accused Hasnain Warekar, is struggling to come to terms with Sunday\u2019s turn of events. Altaf (36), who stays close to where Hasnain lived, was one of the first to reach the spot after Subiya, the sole survivor of the massacre, started screaming for help. Altaf\u2019s shock is rooted in the fact that he had met Hasnain only hours earlier, and he had seemed perfectly normal.\n\n\u201cI met Hasnain around 11.30 pm on Saturday, when I was on my way to meet some friends. He was walking towards his house with a plastic bag. He said he had bought soft drinks as there was a daavat under way. His daavats were well known \u2026 he would call his sisters home on most weekends,\u201d Altaf told The Hindu .\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, Altaf was one of the few to wake up after Subiya started screaming for help through the ground floor window. Alarmed, he ran to the window to check what was happening. Subiya told me: \u201cBhaijaan ne sabko maar diya, woh mujhko bhi maar denge (brother has killed everyone, he will kill me too). I immediately thought of the calm, silent person I had met only hours earlier. I told her to come out and she said she was afraid to move as Hasnain was standing near the front door with the qurbani dagger in his hand,\u201d Altaf said. For nearly half-an-hour, Altaf and his friends pulled a part of the window grille loose, while two others sped to the Kasar Wadavli police station on a motorbike. Subiya was pulled out of the window in a near unconscious state, while the police sent armed personnel to the spot in case Hasnain tried to attack anyone who tried to enter. Hasnain, however, had killed himself by then.\n\nHasnain never\n\ngot into a fight\n\nall his life, says\n\nAltaf Warekar,\n\nhis cousin",
