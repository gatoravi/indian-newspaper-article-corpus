With one eye on TV screens showing market reactions (which remained in the red), the spokespersons highlighted the push towards rural India, the boost to infrastructure, the allocation for irrigation and the tax relief for first-time homeowners as issues at various TV debates to follow. By afternoon, BJP president Amit Shah, too, hailed the budget. \u201cThe 2016 budget has done the job of taking us towards Gaon [village], Kisan [farmer] and gareeb [poor],\u201d he said. Power Minister Piyush Goyal went a bit further. He said the budget \u201ctouched the lives of 1.25 billion Indians\u201d.\n\nSenior BJP leaders told The Hindu that the budget was \u201cpolitical and necessary at this time\u201d when the government had found itself under fire from the Opposition for being anti-farmer.\n\n\u201cThe only problem in the budget and the push for infrastructure is that the States will have to meet 40 per cent of the funding because they have received more funds from the Finance Commission\u2019s payout. That will work only if the political priorities of the State and the Union government match; in the States not under the BJP\u2019s rule, that may be a problem,\u201d said a senior Minister dealing with an infrastructure Ministry.\n\n\u201cThere are reforms in the budget, but the emphasis on rural roads and irrigation and tax exemption to the neo-middle class are important indicators,\u201d said another senior Minister.\n\nA scheme to be launched on B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s birth anniversary to start a unified agricultural e-market and a Rs.500-crore corpus to finance entrepreneurs of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is meant to handle the fall-out of the suicide of Rohith Vemula. The BJP feel that the budget could be \u201csold\u201d not just in the coming Assembly polls, but also in the U.P. elections in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt has done the job of taking us towards Gaon [village], Kisan [farmer] and gareeb [poor]\u201d",
