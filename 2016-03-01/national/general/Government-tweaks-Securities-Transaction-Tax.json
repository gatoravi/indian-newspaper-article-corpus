    "text": "From a capital market perspective, the Union Budget 2016-17 touched upon the issue of securities transaction tax, dividend distribution tax and the holding limit for foreign exchanges in Indian bourses.\n\nA review of the securities transaction tax (STT) was on the market wish list and the Finance Minister did not disappoint though market players expected more. Arun Jaitley announced an increase in the quantum of securities transaction tax (STT) on options contracts from the current 0.017 per cent to 0.05 per cent.\n\nSilver lining\n\nEssentially, the Finance Minister has increased the tax on speculative trading in the derivatives segment while leaving the STT on investments unchanged. In another move that spooked the markets to a large extent, the Budget laid down that dividend income in excess of Rs. 10 lakh would be taxed at 10 per cent.\n\nThe silver lining was the limit of Rs. 10 lakh that effectively insulates small investors from the new tax.",
