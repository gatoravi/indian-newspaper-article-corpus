    "text": "The recent water crisis in the Capital has revealed that Delhi remains unprepared if trouble brews in the neighbouring States, like the Jat agitation in Haryana\n\nith green fields on both sides, the banks of Munak Canal in Haryana\u2019s Mundela village could have been a picnic spot. But, instead of families enjoying the last few days of winter, there are mounds of earth, heavy machinery and columns of Armed forces.\n\nThe canal, which brings 80 million gallons per day of water to Delhi, became a target of Jats protesting for reservation in Haryana last week. First, a mob blocked the gates of the canal at Mundela, then they closed gates 35km upstream at Khubdu, and finally they damaged the canal at Mundela on February 21. The 102-km canal is actually two parallel canals \u2013 a carrier-lined channel (CLC) and the Delhi Sub-Branch or Western Yamuna Canal.\n\nThere is a 200-feet-long breach in the CLC that will take at least 15 days to repair. Haryana has diverted water to the Delhi Sub-Branch canal, but its capacity is 350 cusecs as opposed to the CLC\u2019s 720 cusecs. Till the CLC is repaired, large parts of Delhi, especially Dwarka, will face a shortage.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the water being released by Haryana through the Yamuna river, which accounts for about half of Delhi's supply, has become so polluted that it can't be used. Water treatment plants have been forced to close three times in a week because of high ammonia levels, said Delhi Jal Board chairperson Kapil Mishra on Sunday.\n\nWith taps in lakhs of households going dry, the crisis has once again reminded Delhiites that the Capital is at the mercy of others \u2013 Haryana \u2013 for its basic drinking water needs.\n\n\u201cRight now, the agitation was only in Haryana. Can you imagine what would have happened if it had spread to Uttar Pradesh? We get 240 MGD of water from the Murad Nagar drain in U.P,\u201d said Mr. Mishra.\n\nDelhi had come up with ambitious plans of setting up three dams in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, but the projects have been held up due to environmental concerns and disputes between governments.\n\nThe Renuka Dam in Himachal Pradesh was proposed about 17 years ago, and was supposed to add 275 MGD to Delhi\u2019s water supply. But, the future of the project is up in the air as the Centre and the Himachal Pradesh Government have disagreements over mandatory clearances and compensation.\n\nThe other two projects \u2014 at Lakhwar-Vyasi in Uttarakhand and at Kishau on the Uttarakhand-Himachal Pradesh border \u2014 have also been pending for years.\n\nEven if the land acquisition issues are solved, there are environmental concerns to be addressed. Delhi\u2019s dependence on river waters from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh seems here to stay.",
