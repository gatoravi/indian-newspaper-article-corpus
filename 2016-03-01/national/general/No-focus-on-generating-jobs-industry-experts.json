Joining over 16,000 readers and answering their questions were Dr. Suresh Surana, founder, RSM Astute Consulting Group, a tax, audit and consulting firm, Pankaj Mathpal, MD, Optima Money Managers.\n\n\u201cThe working class may not feel very excited since there is no increase in basis exemption limit of Rs. 2.50 lakh,\u201d said Dr. Surana. Although, as Mr. Mathpal noted, \u201cSuper rich surcharge has been increased to 15 per cent from the existing 12 per cent.\u201d\n\nReaders were concerned about the announcement on the National Pension Scheme and the move to tax only 40 per cent of withdrawals at the time of retirement.\n\nA lot of the focus was also on the announcements to boost start-ups. \u201cThe ease of doing business is the focus of government. The increase in limit of businesses eligible for presumptive tax from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2 crore of annual turnover and bringing professionals with receipts up to Rs. 50 lakh are steps in this direction,\u201d remarked Dr. Surana.\n\nMr. Mathpal felt it was overall a good budget, and \u201cThere is focus on creating jobs and supporting entrepreneurs.\u201d Dr. Surana saw this budget as \u201ca solid step towards fiscal consolidation, reducing litigation and generating employment. It is not a populist budget.\u201d\n\nThe Hindu conducted a live chat with experts to understand the budget better",
