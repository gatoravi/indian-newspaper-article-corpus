    "text": "CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the Union Budget lacked vision and would burden the common man with \u201cinflationary\u201d indirect taxation.\n\n\u201cAs with the previous two budgets, this budget of the Modi govt. is again full of hollow promises and slogans. The numbers just don\u2019t add up. FM says budget is about fulfilling \u2018desires and dreams\u2019 but it has no vision. The dead certainty from it is of a shrinking economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis budget will not kick-start the economy. It is appealing to international capital more than meeting the requirement of the people. Living standards of the people are bound to fall further,\u201d Mr. Yechury said.\n\n\u201cWe have adequate resources which can improve growth. Our objective should be to protect ourselves from the contraction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was not a word on minimum support price for farmers. Our farmers are committing suicide. There has been 26 per cent increase in farmers\u2019 suicide since the NDA assumed power,\u201d Mr. Yechury said.",
