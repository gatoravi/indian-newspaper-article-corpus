This is also reflected among the student community. It is essential that students have a sense of fearlessness and freedom for expressing their thoughts. This should go beyond the curriculum and extend to the state of society and nation,\u201d Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu on the sidelines of a function here on Monday. The former Governor of West Bengal also stressed the need for political leaders to counsel students against extreme and violent thoughts. He held the view that student organisations themselves should practise the balance between freedom of thought and expressions and responsible speech. Pointing out that education and politics had always gone hand-in-hand since the days of the freedom struggle, Mr. Gandhi said that students had to carefully select the kind of politics they wanted to practise. Referring to the tragic death of research scholar Rohith Vemula, Mr. Gandhi said the episode went beyond universities and politics to pose existential questions about the country.\n\n\u201cIn present-day India, individuals have become digits and numbers. This form of digitization of the Indian mind should be countered at all costs,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that Rohith\u2019s \u2018farewell note\u2019 was a testament to the current times and had many layers to it.",
