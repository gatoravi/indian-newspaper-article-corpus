    "text": "The government on Monday opposed a petition filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of penal provisions pertaining to hate speech, saying \u201cthis is not a public interest litigation but a private interest litigation.\u201d\n\nIn a hearing before a Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel, Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar submitted that an FIR under Section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code (hate speech) had been registered against Dr. Swamy and the current petition before the apex court was \u201cbelated\u201d and should be dismissed.\n\nDr. Swamy vehemently protested Mr. Kumar\u2019s submissions, saying he was misrepresenting the issue and the petition was a constitutional challenge. \u201cThis provision has a chilling effect on my freedom to speech and expression. I am questioning its constitutionality,\u201d Dr. Swamy said, objecting to the Solicitor-General\u2019s portrayal of his case. Both men were also seen engaged in a brief but heated exchange in the court.\n\nThe Bench suggested to Dr. Swamy to amend his petition and go to the High Court concerned.",
