This will boost the NDA government\u2019s Make in India initiative and attract foreign players.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said 100 per cent FDI would be allowed through the FIPB route in the marketing of food products made in India. This would address the problem of crop wastage and benefit farmers, he said.\n\nDeep pockets are needed for sustaining a retail food business, and corporates and chambers of commerce are united in their support for this move, even as they await the details of the plan.\n\nSuch a move will support Make in India by encouraging a farmer\u2019s son to set up a food processing unit.\n\nAt present, agriculture has little money for him. He migrates to the city for a better life.\n\n\u201cThe entry of FDI in food marketing will incentivise farmers to adopt correct agricultural practices and make internationally acceptable products,\u201d said a food processor who owns an 80-year-old brand.",
