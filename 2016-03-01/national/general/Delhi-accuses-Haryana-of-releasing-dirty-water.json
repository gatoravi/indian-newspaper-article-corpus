But with the river being highly polluted, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has been unable to use it.\n\nDJB chairperson Kapil Mishra accused Haryana of allowing pollutants to enter the river. A DJB team travelled along the river in Haryana, taking water samples to test the ammonia levels. Referring to a satellite image, Mr. Mishra said the colour of the Yamuna waters turned dark at Sanjoli village where a drain entered the river.\n\nAt Shimla Jujran village in Haryana, where the Panipat Drain brings effluent from the nearby industries, the ammonia level was found to be 56ppm. The permissible limit for untreated water is 0.2ppm.\n\n\u201cIn Delhi, we shut down plants. But people of that village have been exposed to the polluted water. They are getting cancer because of it,\u201d said Mr. Mishra.\n\nWhile talks were on between the chief secretaries of the two States, Mr. Mishra said Delhi had asked Haryana to shut the Panipat Drain, at least till Munak Canal was repaired. Delhi has also written to the Central Pollution Control Board, the Home Secretary and the Union Ministry of Water Resources, asking them to resolve the problem.",
