    "text": "Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday asserted that the budget will take care of the people\u2019s fear of taxation.\n\nAddressing a post-budget press conference, Mr. Jaitley said: \u201cThe monumental change in the presumptive taxation regime will eliminate people\u2019s fear of taxation \u2026that takes care of the shopkeepers and small traders.\u201d\n\nThe proposed extension of the simplified presumptive taxation regime to professionals including lawyers, doctors, architects and interior designers who report total gross receipts of less than Rs. 50 lakh under which profits will be deemed to be 50%, said Mr. Jaitley, will further reduce the compliance burden of the middle class. The increased rent deduction from Rs. 24,000 to Rs. 60,000 and the higher ceiling for tax rebate under Section 87A from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,000, he said, are all relief and benefits for the middle class. \u201cIf I\u2019d raised the income tax threshold that would have been a benefit also for the super rich but what I have done instead is to give relief to the middle class.\u201d\n\nDefending the reliance of the budget on new cesses, including the infrastructure cesses on cars and vehicles, Mr. Jaitley said that since the Government needs resources for building infrastructure it must opt for one of the available levies. \u201cIf I have to provide for new roads I can only levy a cess or raise the service tax rate or excise duties on petrol and diesel\u2026the funds will have to come from somewhere.\u201d The Budget, he said, undertakes the largest ever simplification of taxes, proposes not only strategic disinvestment but also reallocation and recycling of government-owned assets.",
