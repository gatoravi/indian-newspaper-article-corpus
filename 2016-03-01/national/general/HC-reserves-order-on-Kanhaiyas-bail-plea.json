    "text": "After questioning the prosecution about the evidence gathered by it, the Delhi High Court on Monday reserved its order on a bail petition moved by JNU Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar in the sedition case registered against him. The court also inquired about CCTV footage that could establish that Kumar raised \u201canti-India slogans\u201d.\n\nAfter hearing arguments on the bail petition for three-and-a-half hours, the Bench of Justice Pratibha Rani said it would pronounce the order on March 2. Even as Kumar\u2019s counsel refuted the allegations of police, the Delhi Police claimed that some witnesses had identified Kumar and others raising slogans in a controversial event held on the JNU campus on February 9.\n\nSenior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing on behalf of Kumar who is in judicial custody, said a few persons seen with their faces covered had raised slogans inside the campus, while the police had registered the sedition case against Kumar solely on the basis of a video footage circulated after its telecast on a channel.",
