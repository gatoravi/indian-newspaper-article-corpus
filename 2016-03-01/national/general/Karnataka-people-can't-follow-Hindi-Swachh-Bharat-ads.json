Thakur heard a petition by H. Satish Halappa against forcing Hindi or English on the poor of the State. Mr. Halappa said such compulsion was discriminatory and a violation of the people\u2019s rights to use their own language. This, especially when Karnataka had declared Kannada as its official language under the Karnataka Official Language Act, way back in 1963.\n\nMr. Halappa argued that students were left disadvantaged as they were forced to take competitive exams in Hindi or English and not in their mother tongue. Even the Railways used Hindi or English for the tickets issued within the State in violation of Article 345 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Kannada language is losing its primacy in the State due to the dominant use of languages like Hindi in a State where Kannada is spoken and understood by the majority\u201d, the petition contended.\n\nAs far as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign was concerned, Mr. Halappa said, \u201cWhile campaigning in the State of Karnataka, the Central government put up several hoardings with slogans in Hindi, which is not understandable to the general public and ultimately, all the exercise and huge expense of the Central government goes to waste as no fruitful purpose has been served by putting the said advertisements in Hindi.\u201d\n\nActivist tells apex court that public money is\n\nbeing wasted\n\nin the State",
