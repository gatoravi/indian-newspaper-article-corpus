    "text": "The government on Monday defended India\u2019s democratic institutions and diversity, in response to a February 26 letter that 34 US Congressmen had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the threats to religious minorities in India.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that these Members of Congress while applauding India as a pluralistic society with a longstanding commitment to inclusion and tolerance have chosen to focus on just a few incidents,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement, explaining that incidents of intolerance in India are \u201caberrations\u201d.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs had however, refused to comment on the Congressional Report on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in 2015 terming it an \u201cinternal\u201d report.\n\nIn view of similar past examples, Monday\u2019s detailed response from the MEA was noted by veteran diplomats who pointed out that the MEA had the option of ignoring the criticism as it was not made by a government body in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere have been stronger criticism of India in the past by the American caucuses and lobby groups. But we preferred not to respond unless the criticism reflected the opinion of the government of the United States,\u201d said former Indian ambassador to the U.S., Lalit Mansingh, who pointed out that several lobbies are apparently at work in the American power corridors trying to highlight certain recent developments in India.\n\nEarlier, the MEA had downplayed the comments by the U.S. ambassador Richard Verma when the envoy had spoken about \u201cfreedom on campuses\u201d indirectly supporting the agitating students of Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nHowever, in response to the letter from the 34 Congressmen, the MEA drew attention to the vibrant civil society, media, and other institutions that uphold and protect constitutional values of India.\n\n\u201cIndia is proud of its status as the world\u2019s largest democracy. The Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens,\u201d said the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nMEA downplays U.S. envoy\u2019s comments on freedom on campuses",
