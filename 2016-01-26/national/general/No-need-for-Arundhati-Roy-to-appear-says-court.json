    "text": "The Bombay High Court had issued a \u2018criminal contempt of court\u2019 notice to Arundhati Roy on December 23.\n\nJustice Arun Choudhary had issued a \u2018criminal contempt of court\u2019 notice to Ms. Roy on December 23 last on an intervention petition filed by advocate S.P. Bhandarkar for making \u201cscandalous and scurrilous allegations\u201d against the judiciary in an article published in Outlook magazine in May 2015. He asked her to be present in court.\n\nIn a surprise move, Justice V.M. Deshpande recused himself from the matter on Monday.\n\nThe case was then taken up in the court of Justices Gavai and Deshmukh, who disagreed with the argument of K.H. Deshpande, counsel for Ms. Roy, that a matter of criminal contempt could be heard only by the Chief Justice and not by any other judge.\n\n\u201cAgreeing with your contention would be negation of Article 215 of the Constitution,\u201d Justice Gavai said.\n\nThe Division Bench also refused to hear another intervention proposed by advocate Bhandarkar against Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan and asked him to file the petition after the Supreme Court decided on Ms. Roy\u2019s application.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court sought a response from the High Court and the Maharashtra government after Ms. Roy argued that criminal contempt proceedings amounted to choking dissent and produced an \u201cintense chilling effect\u201d on the fundamental right of free expression.",
