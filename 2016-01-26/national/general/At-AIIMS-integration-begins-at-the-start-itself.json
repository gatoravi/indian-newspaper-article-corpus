The lower caste students were quick to conclude that caste discrimination had pushed Meena to end his life.\n\nSince then the AIIMS administration has \u201cconsciously taken measures towards integration of all students. Integration of students begins at the very beginning,\u201d maintains the AIIMS administration.\n\nThough the last student suicide \u2014 third-year nursing student in 2014 \u2014 allegedly due to academic strain and harassment at school is still a fresh memory, the AIIMS asserts that implementation of the integration programmes and anti-ragging measures are followed in a stringent manner.\n\n\u201cStudents are monitored, offered counselling and security and there is no question of allowing any form of isolation or groupism based on caste/State/religion etc here,\u201d says Dr. Sanjeev Lalwani, Registrar, AIIMS.\n\nHe says that to prevent any isolation of certain groups, \u201cafter the initial admission process, students are allotted hostel rooms and faculty mentors by draw of lots and this is done in a totally random manner. The concept is to ensure that no student faces discrimination and is quickly integrated with the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe AIIMS has already put in place a rigorous system to ensure that there is no ragging, harassment or maladjustment among the students. We have several systems in place including, ice-breaker programme, student and faculty orientation sessions, mentoring scheme and a robust security system which ensures that students have the facility to speak up and discuss their problems with the new challenging environment and the academic load,\u201d says Dr. Lalwani.\n\nThe AIIMS also conducts language (English and Hindi) classes which are to help students to tide over any communication problems they may face.\n\n\u201cAbove all, the Institute has requested the faculty \u2014 often the first contact point for students \u2014 to ensure that they stay accessible to students all the time,\u201d says the Registrar.",
