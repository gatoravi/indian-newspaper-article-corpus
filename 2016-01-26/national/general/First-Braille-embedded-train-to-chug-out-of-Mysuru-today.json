The bi-weekly express (Train No. 16229/16230), which chugs out on Tuesday, will leave Mysuru for Varanasi on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nIt has been provided with metallic Braille signage indicating berth numbers, location of alarm chains, toilets, and emergency windows. There are also instructions on how to operate the emergency exit windows. The initiative has been financed by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha from the MPLAD fund.\n\nThough the Puri-Delhi Purushottam Express was the first train in the country to have a Braille-embedded coach, the Mysuru-Varanasi Express will be the first in the country where all reserved coaches have embedded Braille signage, said Rajkumar Lal, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru Division, South Western Railway.\n\nBraille signage has been introduced on one rake of the express and it will soon be introduced in the second rake as well. The Chamundi Express and the Mysuru-Talguppa Express are the other two trains that will be provided with Braille displays after this, Mr. Lal said. \u201cThe plan is to extend the facility to all reserved coaches of long-distance trains in a phased manner,\u201d he added. Braille signage indicating the coach number is next on the agenda.",
