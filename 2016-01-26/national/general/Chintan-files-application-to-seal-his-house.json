    "text": "Artist Chintan Upadhyay filed an application on Monday before the Borivali magistrate court urging the court to direct the police to seal his house and work premises in Juhu.\n\nChintan was arrested on December 28 last year in connection with the murder of his estranged wife Hema Upadhyay and her advocate Harish Bhambhani. In his application, Chintan urged that his house and workplace be sealed.\n\nHe said that in Hema\u2019s absence, Chintan\u2019s workplace is used by her family members and they may plant certain evidence. The advocate appearing on behalf of Chintan said that there is apprehension that an attempt may be made to implicate him, therefore to avoid any misuse of the said property, it should be sealed by Mumbai Police.",
