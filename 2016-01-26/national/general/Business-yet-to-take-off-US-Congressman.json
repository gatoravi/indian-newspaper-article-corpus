    "text": "India\u2019s refusal to amend nuclear liability laws cited as reason\n\nOne year after the Indo-U.S. civilian nuclear deal was announced as done, the commercial end of the deal is moving slower than hoped, says the co-chair of the U.S. Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, Ami Bera. Mr. Bera, who had accompanied U.S. President Barack Obama for his Republic day visit in January 2015, had predicted \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d in trade for U.S. companies after India clarified its liability laws at the time.\n\nThe two companies that had been expected to close deals for nuclear power reactors were GE-Hitachi and Toshiba-Westinghouse, each of which had planned six reactors each several years ago, but had shelved them after India refused to amend its nuclear liability laws. Westinghouse has since revived negotiations on the basis of India\u2019s assurance of an insurance pool for the nuclear supplier, for a plant in Gujarat\u2019s Mithivirdi that it had signed an \u201cearly works\u201d MoU for in 2012. Even so, GE has remained \u201cless than satisfied\u201d with the Indian law, Mr. Bera told The Hindu , adding, \u201cOn the nuclear side, things have been moving quite slowly.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the term disappointed, but it\u2019s not moving as fast as I would have liked to see,\u201d Mr. Bera said in an exclusive interview to The Hindu during a visit to Delhi recently.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bera, it is the defence sector that has seen \u201creal progress\u201d in the year following Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. \u201cI am optimistic and pleased with how the defence relationship is faring. Companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin are looking to produce here, take advantage of Make in India, and it\u2019s all happening quite rapidly,\u201d he said. However, he said he hadn\u2019t given up hope on the nuclear partnership, given that other countries such as Canada, Japan and Australia were moving ahead in their nuclear trade with India. \u201cWe\u2019ll see progress on the civil nuclear front, hopefully, because we are seeing other countries starting to take advantage of the structure, and we hope (U.S.) companies will take advantage of the opportunities there too,\u201d Mr. Bera, who represents Sacramento, California, which has many companies that can benefit from the deal, said.\n\nOfficials say the next big fillip to the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal could come when Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to Washington in March this year to attend the Nuclear Security Summit hosted by Mr. Obama. In recent weeks, negotiations between Toshiba-Westinghouse have picked up pace, Westinghouse chief executive Daniel Roderick disclosed in an interview to Reuters agency in mid-January. In the interview, Mr. Roderick said that the aim was to make a \u201ccommercially significant announcement\u201d during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit, and the final decision would be taken after a closer scrutiny of the Rs.1,500-crore ($222 million) liability-capped insurance pool.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Mr. Roderick said Mr. Modi\u2019s office was \u201cdriving the deal,\u201d but other government authorities also had to hasten the process. \u201cIt is just going to take everyone deciding to have this done by March,\u201d Mr. Roderick said.\n\nCalling for \u201cpatience\u201d from U.S. companies wishing to do business with India, Mr. Bera said that despite Mr. Modi\u2019s commitment to improving the \u201cease of doing business,\u201d a lot still needed to be done to remove red-tape.\n\n\u201cI think the Prime Minister\u2019s challenge is more on the domestic front, working through his bureaucracy on the Indian side,\u201d Mr. Bera explained, adding, \u201cMy message to U.S. companies would be to be patient. It could take 4-5 years to pass the necessary reforms, so they shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the broader goal.\u201d\n\nOn the U.S. election campaign, Mr. Bera, the first Indian-American in the U.S. Congress and who is a supporter of Hillary Clinton, said he expected Indo-U.S. ties to move \u201cwithout a hitch\u201d if Ms. Clinton was elected. On the Republican side, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d he said.",
