    "text": "The Jammu and Kashmir police are distributing posters to help its personnel identify fidayeen dressed in fatigues, while a ban has been imposed on retaining guns during vacations in the wake of growing incidents of policemen disappearing with their weapons.\n\nAs part of the security drill for Republic Day, the police have come up with a diagrammatic differentiation between security personnel and fidayeen. The police asked its personnel to first spot sports shoes and haversacks, a trademark of suicide attackers in Jammu since 2014.\n\nPossession weapons during vacations has been banned, in the wake of cases of policemen joining militancy. \u201cIt has been observed that police personnel\u2026 while proceeding on leave do not deposit their allotted weapons in the posts\u2026. Many times, this has resulted in theft of weapons and there is every possibility of weapons falling into the hands of anti-national elements,\u201d says the order.",
