    "text": "SVS College administrator surrenders before court in Tambaram\n\nThe father of 21-year-old Monisha, one of the three students of SVS Naturopathy and Yoga Science Medical College, Villupuram, who allegedly committed suicide, moved an urgent plea before the Madras High Court on Monday seeking a second post-mortem examination and for transfer of the investigation of the case to the CB-CID.\n\nThe petitioner, M.K. Tamilarasan, who is working as an unskilled labourer with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), also urged the court to direct the authorities to grant an interim compensation of Rs. 25 lakh to his family. When the petition came up for hearing before Justice M.M. Sundresh, Additional Advocate General Arvindh Pandian argued that the petition was not maintainable as the relief being sought (to transfer the investigation to CB-CID) did not fall under the jurisdiction of the court.\n\nConcurring with his submissions, the judge said, \u201cI cannot hear the other two prayers when the main prayer does not fall under this court\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d and directed the High Court registry to post the matter before the appropriate court on Wednesday.\n\nRepresenting the petitioner, advocate R. Sankara Subbu contended that the autopsy of petitioner\u2019s daughter was conducted without the consent of Mr. Tamilarasan. Hence, a second post-mortem should be done by a team of doctors, including a doctor of petitioner\u2019s choice. Meanwhile, Vasuki Subramanian, SVS College administrator, surrendered before the Judicial Magistrate\u2019s court in Tambaram on Monday.\n\nSVS College administrator surrenders before Judicial Magistrate\u2019s court in Tambaram",
