The member countries are to be those that enjoy 300 or more days in a year of bright sunlight.\n\n\u201cFor the last one year, the world has been discussing global warming and how to mitigate it\u2026 For two weeks, there were discussions on global warming in Paris. India expressed keenness on solar alliance. President Hollande was very helpful, did everything possible to bring all nations together,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\nThe Alliance, Mr. Hollande said, would focus on three broad areas. \u201cFirst, it is about pooling together the requests of countries with a huge potential in order to reduce their cost of capital. Second, it is about opening the markets in order to reduce the cost of investment. Third, it is about transferring the necessary technology and know-how from developed to developing countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is also to bring in a lot of investments. We estimated the amount necessary for the advancement of this energy to be more than $1 trillion. We therefore mobilised all resources provided by the COP 21 so that they are made available to all the countries willing to develop solar energy,\u201d Mr. Hollande said.\n\n\u201cProgress is impossible without energy. The developing countries still have a lot of progress to achieve. But the problem is that energy through fossil fuels yields issues of global warming and harm to the environment, and without energy, these countries will sink into darkness,\u201d Mr. Modi said.",
