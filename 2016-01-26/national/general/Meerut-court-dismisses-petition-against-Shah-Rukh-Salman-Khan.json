    "text": "A court here that had earlier accepted a Hindu Mahasabha petition against actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan for \u201churting religious sentiments of Hindus\u201d dismissed the plea on Monday. The Hindutva body had approached the court against the two actors for entering a \u201ctemple\u201d with their shoes on in a promotional advertisement of a reality show.\n\nThe court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the petition, saying the complaint against the actors for their alleged act should come from the management committee of the temple.\n\n\u201cThe court also said there were provisions for people to enter temples with shoes made of clean cloth. I personally have never come across any such instance. Hence I will appeal against the verdict,\u201d said the petitioner Bharat Rajput, president of the Meerut unit of the Hindu Mahasabha.\n\n\u201cThe channel shows Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan inside a Kali temple on the sets of the reality show Bigg Boss that was broadcast last December. This offends my sentiments as a Hindu. Hence I had earlier approached the local court in this regard,\u201d said Mr. Rajput.\n\nThe channel promo shows the two actors in the backdrop of a temple with an idol of goddess Kali in what the channel claimed to be a \u201crecreation\u201d of a scene from the Hindi movie Karan Arjun in which the two acted together.\n\n\u201cNobody should offend anybody\u2019s religious feelings so outrightly. These days, people take Hindu emotions for granted and get away with that. We are against that,\u201d Mr. Rajput said.\n\nHindu Mahasabha had moved court against the actors for entering a temple with shoes",
