Women are prohibited as locals believe there is \u2018harmful vibration emanating from Saturn.\u2019\n\nWith hours to go for Republic Day, Pune-based women\u2019s outfit, Ranragini Bhumata Brigade, on Monday said it would go ahead with its plan to offer worship at the Shani Shingnapur temple in Maharashtra\u2019s Ahmednagar district on Tuesday, defying strong local opposition and administrative diktat.\n\nBy tradition, women are prohibited from offering worship at the famous temple\u2019s sanctum sanctorum owing to the myth of \u2018harmful vibration emanating from the Saturn God or Lord Shani.\u2019\n\nThe brigade is determined to do away with the gender barrier and age-old patriarchal tradition, using democratic means to achieve its goal.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to resort to any form of violence. We are not going to \u2018storm\u2019 the inner sanctum as is being perceived. All 400 women will walk in a single line and worship Lord Shani,\u201d said Trupti Desai, president of the brigade, reacting to the notice served by the Joint Charity Commissioner\u2019s office in Pune barring the brigade\u2019s entry in the temple premises.\n\nCopter booked\n\nMs. Desai said the brigade had booked a helicopter as part of its plan.\n\nAs per the plan, Ms. Desai is to alight from the helicopter to offer worship at the prohibited inner sanctum even as the local administration has doubled its security for fear of a melee that might cause damage to temple property.\n\n\u201cThey may bar us on land but they cannot stop us from the skies,\u201d she said, adding that even if her outfit\u2019s activists were denied entry to the premises, they would offer flowers to their detractors to win them over.\n\nMeanwhile, in the village of Shani Shingnapur, locals and several right-wing groups, represented by the Sanatan Sanstha, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti and its women\u2019s wing, Ranragini Shakha, are galvanising thousands to block the activists from setting foot in the temple.\n\n\u201cIt is not an issue of gender discrimination \u2026 an age-old ritual stipulated by the Vedas and the shastras decrees that no woman can perform the puja of Lord Shani,\u201d said Sanjay Bankar, the temple manager.\n\nAnita Shete, the first woman to be elected president of the temple trust board, said the age-old practice barring women would be \u201cupheld.\u201d",
