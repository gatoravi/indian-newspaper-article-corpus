Rowling\u2019s latest honour isn\u2019t only for her writing.\n\nThe Harry Potter author is to receive the PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award, PEN America told The Associated Press on Monday. Ms. Rowling will be presented her award on May 16 at the literary and human rights group\u2019s annual spring gala in New York. Previous winners include Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie and Tim Stoppard.\n\nIn its announcement on Monday, PEN cited Ms. Rowling\u2019s advocacy of free expression; her founding of the charitable trust Volant, which supports multiple sclerosis research and other causes; and her nonprofit organisation Lumos, which works to reconnect institutionalised children with their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply honoured to receive this award and humbled that my work has been recognized as having moral value by an organisation I so admire,\u201d Ms. Rowling told the AP in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve long been a supporter of PEN, which does invaluable work on behalf of imprisoned writers and in defence of freedom of speech.\u201d Ms. Rowling\u2019s own Potter books have been the targets of censorship and attempted censorship, with the fantasy series\u2019 feats of wizardry leading to worldwide allegations that the author advocates witchcraft and the occult.\n\nPEN America president and prize-winning author Andrew Solomon said in a statement that Ms. Rowling\u2019s writing provides a wealth of \u201cimagination, empathy, humour, and a love of reading, along the way revealing moral choices that help us understand ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough their experiences with Rowling both on and off the page, countless children have learned not only the power of speaking their own minds, but the critical importance of hearing others,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u2014 AP",
