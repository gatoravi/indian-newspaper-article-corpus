Under the \u2018Make in India\u2019 banner, India and France signed a deal that will allow French industrial major Alstom to make 800 high horse power locomotives in India. The locomotives are expected to be made in the electric locomotives factory in Madhepura, Bihar.\n\nBoth sides also signed an agreement on upgrading the Delhi-Chandigarh line to 200 kmph, in keeping with France\u2019s special focus on the Chandigarh \u2018Smart City\u2019 project.\n\nThe broad spectrum covered by the range of agreements marked continuity in bilateral ties, said the former Foreign Secretary, Shyam Saran.\n\n\u201cAgreements on nuclear issue, counterterror, defence show a positive continuum of the past work. But the visit obviously highlights the fact that France remains an important interlocutor for India, in the European Union, as India\u2019s position on sensitive issues have often been supported by France even when it faced opposition from other European powers,\u201d said Mr. Saran, who oversaw the talks on the India-U.S. nuclear agreement, which paved the way for the India-France civil nuclear deal.\n\nIn the joint statement, France also committed itself to supporting India\u2019s bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and India\u2019s accession to the multilateral (nuclear) export control regimes in 2016 itself.",
