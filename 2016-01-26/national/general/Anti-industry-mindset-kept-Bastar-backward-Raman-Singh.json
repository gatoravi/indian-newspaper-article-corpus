Does the iron ore of Bastar belong to Japan, China and other countries? Does Bastar not need roads and infrastructure?\u201d\n\nLambasts Naxals\n\nLashing out at Naxals, Mr. Singh questioned the outlawed party\u2019s contribution to Bastar and its progress.\n\n\u201cNaxals talk of unequal land distribution and claim to be fighting against feudalism. But there was no inequality or feudalism in Bastar. Even the richest person in the village used to go and collect tendu patta (leaves) here. They (Naxals) came to Chhattisgarh because Chhattisgarh\u2019s tribals are bhola bhala (modest). Now, the people of Bastar understand that Maoists have only exploited the region,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHave you (Naxals) educated the people of Bastar in the last 40 years? Have you talked of land reforms? Have you trained people here? It\u2019s all about extorting money,\u201d Mr. Singh charged.\n\nThe Chief Minister said the people of Bastar never accepted Maoists who used terror as the tactic.\n\n\u201cOnly due the fear of the gun, they (Maoists) were given a place here. Now, only two percent of the people support them and that too due to terror. People are convinced that Bastar cannot progress with violence,\u201d Mr, Singh said.\n\nRecounting how the construction of an 8 km-long road in Sukma district a few years ago witnessed the killing of eight policemen by Maoists, Mr. Singh said the situation, however, was improving rapidly.",
