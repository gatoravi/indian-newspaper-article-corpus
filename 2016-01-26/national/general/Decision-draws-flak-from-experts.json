    "text": "Some feel the recommendation is grossly improper, others say it is too early to begin a debate\n\nFrom calling it \u201cgrossly improper\u201d and a \u201cpolitical mischief\u201d to dismissing it as \u201cmere impropriety,\u201d leading Constitutional experts on Monday crossed swords on the Cabinet recommendation to impose President\u2019s rule in Congress-ruled Arunachal Pradesh without waiting for the Supreme Court to show a way out of the political turmoil.\n\nThe State\u2019s ongoing crisis has seen \u201cAssembly sessions\u201d held in a hotel and even a community hall and \u201cimpeachment\u201d of the Speaker.\n\nSenior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said the recommendation was the kind of \u201cpolitical mischief, totally reprehensible, against federalism and parliamentary democracy.\u201d He called the Cabinet\u2019s recommendation \u201cgrossly improper,\u201d specifically because a Constitution Bench of the highest court is examining the issue.\n\n\u2018Political conspiracy\u2019\n\nRajya Sabha member and senior advocate K.T.S. Tulsi did not mince his words. \u201cThe Centre is on a collision course with the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is no doubt that the political conspiracy in Arunachal was hatched in Delhi. By making the recommendation, the Centre wants to present the Supreme Court with a fait accompli and make the entire judicial process infructuous.\u201d\n\nReferring to the historic S.R. Bommai judgment, Mr. Tulsi said the Supreme Court should now seize the moment to judicially review the relevant material based on which the Cabinet advised President\u2019s rule under Article 356(1). The nine-judge Bench verdict in 1994 had held that the validity of a Proclamation for President\u2019s Rule can be subjected to judicial review to find out if there was mala fide exercise of power. This view was reiterated in the 2006 Bihar Assembly Dissolution case judgment involving the then State Governor Bhuta Singh.\n\nHowever, Constitutional expert and senior advocate Soli Sorabjee said the debate should not ignore the fact that the Cabinet had only made a recommendation, and President Pranab Mukherjee had not accepted it. In fact, the President had sought clarifications from the government. \u201cPresident\u2019s rule has not been imposed as yet. The recommendation is only a ministerial advice to the President. It is pre-mature to file any writ petition or debate the legality of President\u2019s rule at this point.\u201d\n\nPadma Bhushan awardee and Constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap said neither the Union Cabinet\u2019s recommendation nor the proclamation of President\u2019s rule would in any way affect the current Supreme Court hearing. \u201cEven after President\u2019s rule kicks in, the Supreme Court can revive the Legislative Assembly, which will not be dissolved but kept in a state of suspended animation, if it finds the President\u2019s proclamation unconstitutional,\u201d he argued.\n\nSenior advocate Arvind P. Datar agreed that there was nothing \u201ctechnically wrong\u201d in the Cabinet recommendation when the matter is sub judice in the Supreme Court. \u201cYou can at best call it impropriety.\u201d Mr. Datar said the entire edifice of the Article 356 law was based on the rather ambiguous phrase \u201cfailure of the Constitutional machinery in States.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here the Centre can argue that there is no working government in Arunachal Pradesh. There is no functional legislature to give instructions to the Executive. Thus, there has been a failure of the Constitutional machinery in the State,\u201d Mr. Datar said.",
