    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Monday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Centre\u2019s recommendation to impose President\u2019s rule in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n\u201cModiji you talk about federalism but murder democracy. You talk about cooperation but use every means to coerce. Imposing President\u2019s rule in Arunachal is a blatant bid to topple a duly elected government. The Congress party will fight this attack on our Constitution, on our democracy and on the people\u2019s mandate,\u201d he said on social media site Twitter.\n\nBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came out in support of the Congress and criticised the Centre\u2019s recommendation. \u201cI strongly condemn the Centre\u2019s move to impose President\u2019s rule in Arunachal Pradesh, while the matter is still pending before the SC\u2019s Constitutional Bench,\u201d said Mr. Kumar.\n\nThe official spokesperson for the BJP, Sudhanshu Trivedi, however, said not recommending President\u2019s rule would have, in fact, imperilled the law and order situation in the State.\n\n\u201cPolitically, this is a subject of internal conflicts of the Congress party, its MLAs crossed over as the Chief Minister and the Speaker were first cousins and that was creating issues among other MLAs of the party,\u201d he said. \u201cConstitutionally too, the State government did not call an Assembly session in the last six months. Even if they do not acknowledge the session, run outside the Assembly premises by so-called rebels in December, the Chief Minister should have called a session by January 21st. In either case it is a fit case for President\u2019s rule,\u201d Mr. Trivedi added.",
