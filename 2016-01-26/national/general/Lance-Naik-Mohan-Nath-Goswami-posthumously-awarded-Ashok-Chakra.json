He returned fire and killed one terrorist at close quarters which also bought them additional time, officials said. He was awarded the Kirti Chakra for his \u201cexemplary leadership, selflessness and courage beyond compare\u201d.\n\nThe other Kirti Chakra was posthumously awarded to Sepoy Jagdish Chand from the Defence Security Corps for his display of raw courage in tackling terrorists during the attack on the Pathankot air base on January 2.\n\nOf the eight Shaurya Chakra given to Army personnel, two were awarded posthumously.\n\nAmong the four Navy gallantry awards, three went to personnel at INS Shikra , the naval air station in Mumbai, for their efforts in the rescue of vessels in distress.\n\nIn the Air Force, the two Vayu Sena Medals (Gallantry) went to Wing Commander Nirmal Kumar Bakshi and Wing Commander Rajiv Dobhal, both Mi-17 helicopter pilots, for their role in Operation Maitri to provide relief operations in adverse weather conditions in Nepal following the devastating earthquake last year.\n\nPresident Pranab Mukherjee approves 365 gallantry awards and other defence decorations",
