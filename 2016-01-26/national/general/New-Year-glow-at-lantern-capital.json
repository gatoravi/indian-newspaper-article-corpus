Known as the \u2018Spring Festival\u2019 in China, the holiday, which falls on February 8 on this occasion, compares in importance to Christmas in the West, and marks a time when for far-flung family members return home for merriment and meals \u2014 according to tradition, they must be back by midnight on the eve of the new year.\n\nTuntou village has specialised in artisanal lantern-making for nearly 40 years. It is not the site of enormous factories, instead the industry is driven by a number of private workshops in which families concentrate on the production of a single lantern element \u2014 their spindly metal frames, the exterior \u201cskin\u201d of fabric or silk, the decorative inscriptions.\n\nAt the back of one assembly unit, high piles of nearly completed lanterns awaited processing, while workers wielded wooden canes to lift others high off the ground to dangle delicately from the ceiling.\n\nThe colour red symbolises luck and happiness in Chinese culture, and the lanterns are omnipresent throughout towns and countryside, trotted out at most important occasions: marriages, business openings, and most of all the Lunar New Year, which generally falls in late January or early to mid February.\n\n\u201cOutside of the peak holiday season, we also receive special requests: giant models, for example, or orders to decorate the Forbidden City in Beijing,\u201d explained Mr. Bai.\n\n\u201cTens of millions of lanterns are produced each year and all or almost all of them are sold. A portion is exported to Southeast Asia, the US or Japan. It\u2019s become an economic pillar for the village,\u201d he said.\n\nTraditionally, positive Chinese characters such as \u201chappiness\u201d, \u201cpeace\u201d, and \u201cfamily\u201d are painted on their sides. But in recent years their inscriptions have become increasingly political. \u201cThe majority of these lanterns are decorated with one of the twelve \u2018socialist core values\u2019 promoted by President Xi Jinping,\u201d said Mr. Bai. \u2014 AFP",
