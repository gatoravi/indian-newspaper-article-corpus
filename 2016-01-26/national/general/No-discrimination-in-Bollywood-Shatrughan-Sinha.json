    "text": "On the fifth and concluding day of the ZEE Jaipur Literature Festival on Monday, BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha said there was no intolerance or discrimination in the Hindi film industry.\n\n\u201cMany things were said by people in the film industry on tolerance and intolerance. But, certainly I stand by what Kajol said [there is no intolerance in Bollywood],\u201d Mr. Sinha said.\n\n\u201cI have never seen discrimination in the film industry on the basis of caste, or religion. The only colours they recognise in the film industry are the colours of success and failure. Film industry avoids failures whether it comes from a Bihari or a Pahadi. It only recognises success regardless of caste, creed and religion,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.\n\nBringing in the political angle, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was present during the session with Mr. Sinha, said the political environment in the country was \u201chighly intolerant.\u201d",
