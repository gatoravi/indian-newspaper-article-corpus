    "text": "Hitting out at Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan for advocating a rethink of reservation, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Monday said the remark reflected a \u201cparochial anti-Dalit\u201d and \u201cManuwadi\u201d mentality.\n\nWhile addressing officials of local bodies at an event on smart cities in Ahmedabad on Saturday, Ms. Mahajan had wondered why a review had not happened even after so many years after Independence.\n\nMs. Mahajan also quoted B.R. Ambedkar to justify her point. Though she later clarified that her remark was not a verdict for or against reservation, coming months after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat expressed similar views, it triggered sharp responses.\n\nMs. Mayawati said the Speaker\u2019s remarks added fuel to the controversy over the death due to \u201ccasteist oppression\u201d of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula.",
