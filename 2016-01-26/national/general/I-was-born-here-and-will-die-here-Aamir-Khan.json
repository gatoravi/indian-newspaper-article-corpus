These kind of things happen. There are so many good things also which we don\u2019t speak about. Unfortunately, we have the habit of only pointing out the wrong things but, nevertheless, everybody has the right to talk,\u201d Akshay told India Today TV.\n\nAsserting that no other country is as diverse as India, Aamir said, \u201cI was born here and I will die here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said India was intolerant or I wanted to leave the country. I also understand the emotions of those who were hurt. I would like to say that my statement was misunderstood and to some extent the media is responsible for it. I was born here and I will die here,\u201d the PK star told reporters in Mumbai on the eve of his 2006 superhit Rang De Basanti completing 10 years.\n\nAamir\u2019s statement last November that he was \u201calarmed\u201d by a number of incidents and that his wife Kiran Rao even suggested that they should probably leave the country caused a nationwide outrage. \u2014 PTI",
