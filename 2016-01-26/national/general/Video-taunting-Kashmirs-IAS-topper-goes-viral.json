Look at his [Faesal] property in Kupwara and now in Srinagar. How does he acquire such a property\u2026He doesn\u2019t know he has laid his hand in lion\u2019s mouth,\u201d says Wani in the video.\n\nWani apparently was enraged by the department\u2019s move to transfer many teachers associated with the forum. Faesal has been critical of the forum in the past and called it \u201ca mafia.\u201d\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader and MLC Nayeem Akhtar, also former Education Minister, expressed his \u201cdeep regret\u201d over the video.\n\n\u201cTo put it mildly, our public discourse has touch a new low. It becomes a societal crisis when it\u2019s led by a teacher against the son of another teacher, who has distinguished himself as one of the best statements Kashmir society has made in recent history,\u201d said Mr. Akhtar.\n\nWhile netizens demanded action against the teachers\u2019 leader for his remarks, Wani distanced himself from the video. \u201cIt is a managed video\u2026My speech was not against Faesal, but the government policies,\u201d Wani told The Hindu .\n\nHe said his forum is organising state wide protests on January 30 against the government policies. \u201cThe government under Nayeem Akhtar and others instituted screening test for teachers and is imposing more bureaucrats than academicians on the department. Similarly, the ban on private tuition during the winters has affected 13.5 lakh students, while government-run coaching is a big failure. Teachers hired under several schemes continue to be without salaries for months together,\u201d said Wani.\n\nOn Facebook Faesal wrote: \u201cOur problem is that we didn\u2019t join IAS to get easy salary and run the system as per requirements of the moment. We didn\u2019t join to make fortunes or make friends with the evil. We were trained to challenge the status quo.\u201d",
