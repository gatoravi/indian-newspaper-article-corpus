    "text": "The Marathi literary world received a shot in the arm on Monday with the Sahitya Akademi\u2019s announcement in New Delhi that Pune-based author-translator Dr. Damodar Khadse had won an award in the Best Translation category.\n\nDr. Khadse has been awarded for his adroit translation of noted Marathi litterateur Sadanand Deshmukh\u2019s visceral award-winning 2004 novel Baromas (Forever) \u2014 it deals with the plight of farmers in Vidarbha \u2014 into Hindi. Mr. Deshmukh himself was awarded the Sahitya Akademi for the book. \u201cIt was a challenge and a pleasure tackling Mr. Deshmukh\u2019s complex book as I had to unravel the syntax written in a dialect spoken by the farmers of the Vidarbha region. I was in close consultation with Mr. Deshmukh as I wanted to render the rhythms and cadences of the novel as faithfully and flavourfully as possible,\u201d said an ecstatic Dr. Khadse, who has more than 30 poetry and prose collections in Hindi to his name besides numerous renderings of Marathi works into Hindi.\n\n\u201cThis will immeasurably help in foregrounding Marathi literature besides making a great novel accessible to vast multitudes of Hindi readers.\u201d\n\nOne of his particularly noteworthy translations is that of Laxman Mane\u2019s searing 1980 award-winning autobiographical work Upara (An Outsider), which is considered to be an iconic book in Marathi Dalit literature.",
