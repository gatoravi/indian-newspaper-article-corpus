Attack on mediapersons is highly improper and condemnable\u201d, he tweeted, even as mediapersons were attacked by lawyers within the Patiala House court complex for a second day.\n\nClosure of varsity demanded\n\nBut even as Mr. Jaitley expressed some solidarity with the media, one of his colleagues in the Union Council of Ministers, Minister for Small and Medium Enterprises, Giriraj Singh, demanded the closure of the university.\n\n\u201cThe supporters of traitors are the agents of (JuD chief ) Hafiz Saeed. I feel ashamed of Rahul Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) should be shut down,\u201d he said. Minister of State for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi participated in a protest on the JNU issue, saying, \u201cThe anti-national events in JNU are a fight between Break India and Build India.\u201d\n\nHe asked, \u201cWhether supporting anti-national activities and anti-national elements is not sedition? Whether demanding \u2018freedom\u2019 of Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, is not sedition? Whether raising slogans such as \u201c Bharat ki barbadi tak jang rahegi jari \u201d is not sedition? Are these activities not anti-national?\u201d\n\nMinister for Communications Ravi Shankar Prasad referred to JNU as a premier institute that had produced many eminent thinkers, civil servants and leaders. \u201cWe all think that there is also a very eloquent, powerful and constructive alternative voice in the JNU. The country is equally eager to hear that voice,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue of the JNU campus as an ideological battle ground for the government and the BJP, therefore, remains.",
