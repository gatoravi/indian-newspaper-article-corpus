    "text": "The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday asked the State government to respond to a plea by the non-minority private unaided schools seeking an increase in the fee to be paid by the government to them for 25 per cent of the seats filled up under the Right to Education (RTE) Act quota.\n\nJustice A.S. Bopanna passed the order on an application filed by the Associated Managements of Government Recognised English Medium Schools in Karnataka in a pending petition, filed by it questioning the government\u2019s right to admit students to pre-school under the RTE quota.\n\nNotification\n\nIn its plea, the association pointed out that the government, on May 8, 2012, issued a notification stating that it would reimburse a fee of Rs. 11,848 for primary education (from Class 1 onwards) per child every year, and Rs. 5,924 for pre-school sections. The association said the government had not increased the fee from the past four consecutive academic years even though private school managements had given representations seeking an increase, and added that it would be difficult to run the schools as the government had failed to reimburse the fee in full as per the 2012 notification.\n\nThey questioned the rationale of fixing a \u201cmeagre\u201d fee of Rs. 11,848 for primary section when the government recently published a draft fee of Rs. 11,500 for reimbursement for admissions under the RTE quota to pre-schools in Bengaluru city limits.\n\nHigh Court asks govt. to respond\n\nto plea by school managements\u2019 association",
