    "text": "At a time when Jawaharlal Nehru University Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar has been booked under sedition, eminent historian Romila Thapar said on Wednesday that sedition was a colonial-era law meant to clamp down on people and should be reconsidered in a free nation.\n\nThe veteran scholar, who taught ancient history at JNU for decades, also said universities should sort out matters and that student outfits should refrain from impressing their political parties by playing up issues.\n\n\u201cWe have inherited a vast number of colonial laws that were meant for a different society. Today, we are not a colony. These laws need to be reconsidered now,\u201d Professor Thapar told students at Ramjas College here while delivering a lecture on secularism.\n\nShe expressed concern over the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaque at Dadri near Delhi, saying, \u201cPeople in authority kept saying it was an accident. One does not expect this as a citizen.\u201d\n\nShe underlined that secularism and nationalism were \u201cinseparable,\u201d while asserting that secularism did not mean religion had no place in society.\n\n\u201cSecularism does not deny religion\u2019s presence. It separates institutions that have religious control and those which should not have it,\u201d she said.",
