More extreme bends speed up the page flips,\u201d said Vertegaal.\n\n\u201cUsers can feel the sensation of the page moving through their fingertips via a detailed vibration of the phone. This allows eyes\u2014free navigation, making it easier for users to keep track of where they are in a document,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a user plays the \u201cAngry Birds\u201d game with ReFlex, they bend the screen to stretch the sling shot. As the rubber band expands, users experience vibrations that simulate those of a real stretching rubber band,\u201d Vertegaal said.\n\n\u201cWhen released, the band snaps, sending a jolt through the phone and sending the bird flying across the screen,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI",
