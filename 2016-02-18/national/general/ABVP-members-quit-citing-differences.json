The letter adds that they cannot be the \u201cmouthpiece\u201d of a government that has \u201cunleashed oppression\u201d on the student community.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be mouthpiece of a government which has legitimised the action of right-wing fascist forces in Patiala House court and in front of JNU North Gate,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cEvery day we see people assemble at the front gate of JNU with the Indian flag to beat up students. Well this is hooliganism not nationalism, you can\u2019t do anything in the name of the nation, there is a difference between nationalism and hooliganism,\u201d it adds.\n\nIt also clarifies their position that they cannot tolerate \u201canti-national\u201d slogans. \u201cAnti-India slogans can\u2019t be tolerated on the campus or any part of the country.\u201d",
