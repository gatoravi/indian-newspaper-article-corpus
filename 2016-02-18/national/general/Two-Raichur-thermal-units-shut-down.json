The remaining five units, with an installed capacity of 210 MW each, were generating power at half their installed capacity.\n\nAccording to sources, RTPS requires 100 cusecs of water at any given point for running all its eight units at optimal level. However, owing to the reduced water-level in Krishna river, the RTPS units are being operated with 40 cusecs of water.\n\nIn order to meet the water requirement for RTPS, 1,000 cusecs of water from Basavasagar reservoir and another 300 cusecs of water from Gugal barrage is released. However, the illegal drawing of water for irrigation along the river and huge pits caused by massive sand extraction have delayed the water reaching RTPS.\n\nRTPS executive director C. Venugopal. however, said that water was expected to reach the power station within a day and all the units would resume power generation.",
