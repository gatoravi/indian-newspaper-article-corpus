    "text": "The four persons, allegedly associated with a SIMI module, who were arrested on Wednesday in Rourkela, Odisha, had taken shelter in Karnataka for a long time after they escaped from a Khandwa prison in October 2013. They are also suspected to be involved in three terror-linked cases in the State. Sources said the gang was suspected to have taken a rented accommodation in Dharwad and were posing as cloth merchants till November 2014. At least two safe houses of the module were discovered after the gang moved out, with the police on their trail.\n\nAfter the police recovered CCTV camera footage of a bank robbery in Karimnagar, Telangana, in February 2014, showing the gang members carrying out the loot, the investigators believe that the same gang may have been involved in a dacoity at a private finance firm in Kalaburagi in which Rs. 1.52 crore worth gold ornaments were looted in November 2013.\n\nNational Investigation Agency (NIA) and intelligence sleuths suspect that these robberies were carried out to fund the gang\u2019s terror activities.\n\n\u201cThey had taken away the digital video recorder (DVR) and the probe had hit a dead end. Now, the private firm officials may be able to identify the arrested suspects,\u201d a senior Kalaburagi police officer said.\n\nThe module is suspected to have visited Bengaluru multiple times.",
