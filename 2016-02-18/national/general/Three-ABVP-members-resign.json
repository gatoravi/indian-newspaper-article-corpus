    "text": "Three office-bearers of the JNU unit of the ABVP on Wednesday resigned from the student wing of the BJP protesting against the Centre\u2019s handling of the raging row at the premier university and \u201clegitimising\u201d actions of right wing fascist forces.\n\nPradeep Narwal, Joint Secretary of JNU unit of the ABVP, said he has quit the party. Rahul Yadav, President of ABVP unit of JNU\u2019s School of Social Sciences (SSS) and its Secretary Ankit Hans have also said they have quit.\n\nIn a joint statement, they said have decided to quit ABVP as they have serious differences over the way the NDA government was handling the issue, adding there was a difference between \u201cinterrogation and crushing ideology and branding entire Left as anti-national.\u201d\n\nThey expressed deep anguish over assault on mediapersons and JNU students and teachers in Patiala House Court complex on Monday as well as attack on JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar in the same court complex on Wednesday, alleging that the government was \u201clegitimising\u201d the action of right wing fascist forces.\n\n\u201cWe are resigning from the ABVP and disassociating ourselves from any further activity of the party as per our difference of opinion over the current JNU incident and long standing difference of opinion with MANUSMIRITI (Smriti Irani) and Rohith Vermula incident.\n\n\u201cAnti-national slogans on February 9 on university campus were very unfortunate and heart breaking. Whosoever responsible for that act must be punished as per the law but the way NDA government is tackling the whole issue, the oppression on professors, is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u2014 PTI",
