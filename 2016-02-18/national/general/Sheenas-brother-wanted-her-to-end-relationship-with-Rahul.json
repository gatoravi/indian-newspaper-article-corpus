This has come to light in Rahul\u2019s statement as told to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is mentioned in the supplementary charge sheet filed by the agency on Tuesday.\n\nSheena Bora was Indrani\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage while Rahul is Peter Mukerjea\u2019s son from his first marriage. It is known that Peter and Indrani, who have been charged with Sheena\u2019s murder, were opposed to her relationship with Rahul .\n\nHowever, Rahul\u2019s additional statement states that Mikhail also pressured Sheena to break her relationship with him.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of pressure on Sheena to break the relationship with me. Indrani Mukerjea was pressuring her through Mikhail Bora to sever our relationship or be ready to face the disinheritance from Guwahati property as consequences thereof.\u201d\n\nIn this regard, Sheena was trying to contact Indrani Mukerjea on her mobile phone a number of times through calls/SMSes to tell her to sit and talk on the issue of our relationship and to put an end to the harassment because of that,\u201d reads Rahul\u2019s statement.\n\nRahul stated that Sheena\u2019s grandparents were also against their relationship due to pressure from Indrani.\n\nHe said he did not attend Sheena\u2019s friend\u2019s marriage in Guwahati as he thought his presence would not be liked by her grandparents and her brother Mikhail.",
