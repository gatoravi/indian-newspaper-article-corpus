The End\n\nWhen Astrid (Julia Jentsch) learns she\u2019s going to have a child with Down\u2019s syndrome, she storms out of the doctor\u2019s office. Luckily, her boyfriend Markus (Bjarne M\u00e4del) is a good, strong man. \u201cI\u2019m getting two pieces of Danish. One for you, and one for... you,\u201d he smiles. \u201cAnd then we will sleep on it.\u201d But does the we word apply? What\u2019s at stake, after all, are the rest of her life, her emotions, her chaotic career as a stand-up comic (and all the attendant media attention that will fall on her ).\n\nAnna Zohra Berrached\u2019s 24 Weeks ( 24 Wochen in German; the number refers to the six-month-old foetus) doesn\u2019t judge Astrid, but it\u2019s impossible for us not to be conflicted when we hear how the child will go if she decides to abort (which is legal in Germany). A Potassium Chloride injection will stop the heart, the 1.50-kg corpse will be placed on the mother\u2019s chest for a last goodbye. 24 Weeks make us see \u2013 literally see \u2013 what the pro-life people are talking about, even if we are pro-choice.\n\n* * *\n\nThe great French director Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9 likes to say he doesn\u2019t make movies \u2013 he finds them as he goes along. His new film, another one of his high-toned melodramas, is ostensibly the story of two boys \u2013 Damien (Kacey Mottet Klein), Thomas (Corentin Fila) \u2013 who cannot stand each other. But when Thomas\u2019s mother gets pregnant, he moves into Damien\u2019s house so he can be near the hospital, and... Being 17 ( Quand on a 17 ans ) is divided into three \u201ctrimesters\u201d, as we follow the relationship between the boys, who battle sexual confusion with aggression. But this is also about Damien\u2019s mother, whose husband is off fighting a war.\n\nIt\u2019s also about Thomas\u2019s parents, who 17 years after adopting him, are overjoyed at the prospect of a \u201creal child,\u201d though we are told there is no such thing as a \u201cfake child.\u201d It\u2019s the complex web of life, in other words \u2013 and T\u00e9chin\u00e9 is a master weaver. The tale may be clich\u00e9, but the telling never is.\n\n* * *\n\nDanis Tanovic\u2019s Bosnian drama Death in Sarajevo ( Smrt u Sarajevu ) is set in a hotel on the centenary of the assassination that set off World War I. A high-level EU delegation is expected, and the staff, who haven\u2019t been paid in months, want to use the opportunity to stage a strike. The film, as it follows multiple characters, instantly slots itself as \u201cAltmanesque\u201d. Children practice Ode to Joy , the staff members elect a leader, a French dignitary rehearses a speech even as CCTV cameras spy on him, and Lamija (Snezana Vidovic), the overwhelmed manager\u2019s right hand, is trying to shrug off the moonstruck man she spent the night with.\n\nThe action, mirroring the various hierarchies of politicking and negotiations, glides from the terrace to the lobby to the kitchens and laundry rooms below, and the snaking camerawork lets us see how labyrinthine the situation is. Even if a lot of the content goes over one\u2019s head (the Bosnian Muslim position, the Black Hand, unity of Southern Slavs, Chetnik thugs), the form, the filmmaking , is a model of clarity.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Guillaume Nicloux\u2019s The End \u2013 one of the many films much better than those in the competition section \u2013 Gerard Depardieu plays a man who goes on a hunt with his dog. It disappears, and looking for it, he loses his way. What is this pond doing here?\u201d he wonders. \u201cWhere\u2019s all this water coming from?\u201d More questions follow: Who stole his gun? Who is the strange boy who seems to know his way through this maze? Who is the ashen woman who lands up naked? And are those really scorpions, the kind you find in deserts? What looks, at first, a man-cut-off-from-civilisation drama (like Cast Away or All Is Lost ) slowly morphs into an existential horror movie. Soon, bugs are crawling all over the Depardieu character, but even that\u2019s not as scary (to us) as his slow approach to the woman, in a scene where she\u2019s seen only from the back. We expect her to turn and... But there are no cheap thrills. Only a what-just-happened? ending that you will be discussing for days.",
