    "text": ": The government has denied that the Intelligence Bureau (IB) had generated a report which said that Umar Khalid, one of the students who was shouting slogans at a pro-Afzal Guru event at JNU on February 9 was a supporter of Pakistan based terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).\n\nSome television news channels carried a report that Khalid, who was among the most vocal supporters of Afzal Guru at the JNU event had been to Pakistan on several occasions and received help from the terrorist group to organise protests here.\n\n\u201cWe have not issued any such alert. It is a figment of someone\u2019s imagination. You can always attribute anything to the IB, since we don\u2019t come out in the open to deny or confirm,\u201d a top intelligence official told The Hindu .\n\nA senior Home Ministry official also said that he was not privy to any such IB report. Officials also said that Delhi Police acted in an \u201coverzealous\u201d manner while handling the student issue at JNU and they could have been hasty in arresting JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\n\u201cThe aspect that outsiders would have raised \u2018anti-India\u2019 slogans is also being looked into. We are not sure but we are closely watching the activities of Committee of Release of Political Prisoners, an organisation which called the meeting at the Press Club of India for which Kashmiri activist SAR Geelani was arrested,\u201d said the official.\n\nOfficials said that the case could have been investigated in a more professional more and should have gathered enough evidence before arresting Kanhaiya Kumar.",
