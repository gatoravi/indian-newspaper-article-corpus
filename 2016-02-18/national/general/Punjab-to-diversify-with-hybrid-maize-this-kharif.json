The file photo shows hybrid maize being displayed at an exhibition.\n\nTo give an impetus to crop diversification, the government in Punjab, India\u2019s grain bowl, plans to replace the water-guzzling paddy (rice) with hybrid maize in two lakh hectares this kharif season (2016-17).\n\nThe government will go in for hybrid maize, considered the best alternative to paddy, in 14 districts.\n\nData from the Agriculture Department show that during 1976-77, maize was grown on 5.8 lakh hectares, and the area has now come down to 1.3 lakh hectares.\n\n\u201cSince the hybrid varieties of maize that yield 6-7 tonnes a hectare are now available, the area can be increased to 8 lakh hectares to meet the requirements of cattle feed, poultry and starch production,\u201d said an agriculture department official.\n\nThe government has established a maize board to help farmers in production and marketing.\n\n\u201cFarmers face problems in marketing maize because of its higher moisture content of 25-30 per cent at the time of harvest. For storage, the moisture content should not be more than 14 per cent,\u201d the official said.\n\nTo overcome this problem, the government has installed dryers in many markets at a cost of Rs. 52.85 crore. Small dryers, costing Rs. 6 lakh each, are being given to village co-operative societies and individual farmers on a 50 per cent subsidy, subject to the maximum of Rs. 2.5 lakh.",
