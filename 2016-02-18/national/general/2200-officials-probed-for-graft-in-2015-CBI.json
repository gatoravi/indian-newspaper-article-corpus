If CBI will not side with them, who will?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe CBI\u2019s efforts led to issuance of Interpol alerts in 114 cases, whereas in 80 cases, letters of request were sent to foreign jurisdictions seeking information on various cases.\n\nIn the past one year, the CBI also focussed on cases of bank fraud.
