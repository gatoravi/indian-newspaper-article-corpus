    "text": "The Bombay High Court on Wednesday refused to grant any relief to Peter Mukerjea and his kin who had sought a stay on the release of a Bengali film Dark Chocolate based on the Sheena Bora murder case.\n\nA division bench of Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari and Justice G.S. Patel gave this ruling while hearing a petition filed by Peter Mukerjea, who has been charged with murder, and his sister Shangon Dasgupta alleging defamation. The petition states that the Kolkata-based director Agnidev Chaterjee was openly promoting the film and its characters.\n\nThe Bench said that the trailer alone could not be considered adequate premise for the allegations of defamation and contempt.\n\nThe Bench held that Ms. Dasgupta\u2019s apprehensions were \u201cpremature\u201d since she had relied only on the promos or the trailer released by the film-makers on the Internet.\n\nThe Bench ruled that the petitioner should have gone through the entire film and its script before making any allegations.\n\nBesides, the Bench said, Ms. Dasgupta should have stuck to inferring \u201conly whether her brother\u2019s right to a fair trial was being affected by the film or not\u201d.\n\nThe court said the depiction of what was already in public domain did not necessarily prejudice one.",
