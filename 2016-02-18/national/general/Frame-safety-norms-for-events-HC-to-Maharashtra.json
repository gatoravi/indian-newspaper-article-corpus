    "text": "Taking cognisance of the fire that interrupted at the Maharashtra Night gala at the Make In India Week on Sunday, the Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the state to frame guidelines for the safety of artists and technicians on stage during performances.\n\nA division bench of Justices VM Kanade and Revati Mohite-Dere was hearing a PIL petition filed by the Association For Aiding Justice seeking safety measures for artists and others performing in an event.\n\nThe PIL demanded that all those working on a production (set) or at an event should be given information that enables them to do their job safely.\n\nThe PIL said that irrespective of the duration of the engagement period, all those working on a production or an event must be given orientation at every work site where they perform. This must include information relevant to the event or production.\n\nIt also contended that \u201cThere is no general code of safe practices for events like the one held at the Girgaum Chowpatty where the stage was engulfed in fire\u201d.\n\nThe court said if such guidelines have not been framed yet, then it is high time that a policy is framed or rules are drawn up immediately to ensure safety of artists and technicians on stage and also that of the audience.\n\n\u201cThis is not about this event where a fire broke out causing panic among the audience. Fortunately, the government took steps and no untoward incident happened and everyone was evacuated,\u201d the bench said.",
