Jagadesh Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, JNU, states: \u201cIt is ironic that this attempt to suppress dissent occurred at one of the country\u2019s leading universities\u2026. Senior members of the government have aggressively targeted your students. The JNU administration should have protected its students against these attacks and charges that have also vitiated the police investigation. We are deeply disappointed that you have failed to carry out this responsibility.\u201d\n\nUrging the university authorities to protect freedom of speech, the statement says: \u201cWe hope that you will take urgent corrective steps to ensure that the police release the arrested students, and also ensure that they drop the unsubstantiated charges against them. We also hope that, in the future, you will take steps to protect freedom of speech on the JNU campus.\u201d\n\nThe petition has been signed by 379 senior academics and scientists, including Jean Dreze of Ranchi University, Speta Wadia and Shiraz Minwalla of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Debasis Sengupta of the Indian Institute of Science and Madhusudhan Venkadesan of Yale University.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that this attempt to suppress dissent occurred at one of the top varsities\u201d",
