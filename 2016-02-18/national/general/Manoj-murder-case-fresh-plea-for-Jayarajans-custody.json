    "text": "The Central Bureau of Investigation probing the murder of RSS functionary E. Manoj withdrew its plea in the District and Session Court at Thalassery seeking the custody of CPI(M) P. Jayarajan, now in judicial custody, and filed a fresh plea with the same demand.\n\nThe CBI withdrew the plea in the morning on technical grounds as the report of the medical board that examined Mr. Jayarajan had not arrived. The court was likely to reject the plea since the medical board\u2019s report was not sent to the court. The defendant\u2019s counsel had already argued that his client\u2019s health condition was not good. Had the Sessions Court rejected the plea, the CBI would have had no option but to approach the High Court. This led to the CBI\u2019s withdrawal of the earlier plea and submission of the fresh plea.\n\nSources said the preliminary report submitted to the court on February 15 had said that Mr. Jayarajan was under observation for a couple of days and the detailed report of the medical board was also expected.",
