    "text": "Forests in Adilabad district, especially the vegetation in the core area of Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR), is currently under attack by termites. The stem of thousands of trees in the jungle is covered with mud layers.\n\nThis has spread on an unprecedented scale and teak trees ( Tectona grandis ) seem to be the main target though trees of other species have also been attacked by termites. Though mature teak and other trees are sturdy enough to resist the attack, it is the trees with smaller girth which can succumb to the pestilence.\n\n\u201cEnvironment can be a fragile entity and the one in KTR cannot be any different. A scientific study is essential to take timely action to prevent any loss due to termite attack,\u201d opined Dr. E. N. Murthy of the Botany Department, Shatavahana University, Karimnagar.",
