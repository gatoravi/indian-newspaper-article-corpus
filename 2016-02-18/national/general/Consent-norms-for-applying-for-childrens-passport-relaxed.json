Though the Ministry had introduced some relaxation last year, there were other RPOs too who felt the need for further liberalisation, sources said.\n\nNow, \u2018Annexure G,\u2019 an affidavit that single parents have to file if there is no consent from the other parent, specifies reasons one can pick under the clause: \u201cSignature/consent of ... (name of the father/mother) who is father/mother/parents of the child has not been obtained by me for the following reasons.\u201d This was earlier blank \u2014 allowing parents to fill in whatever the reason was, said P.S. Karthigeyan, Regional Passport Officer, Bengaluru. The problem with that was a lack of clarity on what could be considered a \u201cvalid\u201d reason.\n\n\u201cThis would be limited to reasons such as not knowing the whereabouts of the other parent. The Passport Seva Kendras are not designed to take up such issues on a case-to-case basis,\u201d he said.\n\nMEA has increased grounds applicants can cite for not having the other parent's consent",
