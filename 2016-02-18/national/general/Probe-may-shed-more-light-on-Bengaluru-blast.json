The NIA had then claimed that Afridi was working on the instructions of a \u201chandler\u201d, who they suspect is part of the SIMI module busted in Rourkela.\n\nAfridi, suspected to be involved in the 2008 Ahmedabad blast also, was hiding in Bengaluru under the alias Rafeeq and working as an AC mechanic.\n\nAfridi is accused of participating in the December 2007 terror training camp at Vagamon in Kerala. A key member of the now-busted Khandwa module, Sheikh Mehboob alias Guddu is also an accused in the Vagamon terror camp case. Abu Faisal, the leader of the Khandwa module, who escaped from prison in October 2013 but was nabbed in December 2013, had also allegedly participated in the camp.\n\n\u201cNot just that, Afridi is a known associate of Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer, a SIMI leader and one of the organisers of the Vagamon camp. Intelligence reports have recorded a meeting between Abu Faisal, the now-jailed leader of Khandwa module and Tauqeer in 2011. Afridi is either one of the two verticals working for Tauqeer (the other one is suspected to be the Khandwa module) or he may have been directly working for the Khandwa module,\u201d a senior NIA official said.",
