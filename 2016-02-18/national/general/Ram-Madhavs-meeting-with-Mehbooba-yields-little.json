No other leader was present, sources said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Madhav avoided the media and rushed to the Srinagar airport for his return flight.\n\nThe meeting once again failed to yield a decision on government formation.\n\nSources said Ms. Mufti again reiterated her demands. Sources said the PDP-BJP coalition continued to hang by a thread. \u201cTo sustain the coalition, more spadework is needed, and we are not meeting any deadline,\u201d a top PDP source said.\n\nPDP sources denied that the Jawaharlal Nehru University issue might cast a shadow on government formation. But it might delay the process. Ms. Mufti, a Member of Parliament from Anantnag, is leaving for Delhi on February 21 to attend the parliamentary session. The two parties may announce the final decision in the capital.\n\nThe sources said the recent developments did create a positive atmosphere.",
