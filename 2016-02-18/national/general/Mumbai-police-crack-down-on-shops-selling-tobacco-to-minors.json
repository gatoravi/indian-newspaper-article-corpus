    "text": "Armed with the new Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Act, 2015, enacted in January this year, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has launched a citywide crackdown on commercial establishments selling tobacco products to minors.\n\nThe Act was amended last year after the controversy surrounding the punishment given to a minor in the Nirbhaya rape case. The amendment changed the age limit from 18 to 16 years for juveniles accused of serious crimes. Simultaneously, the Act also introduced several stringent sections for crimes committed against minors, which attract strict punitive measures. Among them is Section 77, which makes giving any kind of drugs, liquor or tobacco products to children punishable by law, and Section 78, which forbids use of children for vending, peddling, carrying, supplying or smuggling any drug or liquor.\n\n\u201cThe earlier Act had Section 25, which only forbade giving liquor or intoxicants to a child and made it punishable with up to three years of imprisonment. Section 77 of the new Act specifically mentions tobacco products and imposes a sentence of seven years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh,\u201d said DCP (Enforcement) Pravin Patil.\n\nAmended law imposes a sentence of seven years\n\nRI and up to\n\nRs. 1 lakh fine",
