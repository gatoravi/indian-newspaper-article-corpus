Nagesh at a recent meeting in Adilabad.\u2014 Photo: Special Arrangement\n\nAlthough the worst forms of discrimination have been jettisoned by society at large, it still exists in many forms in the act of serving tea and snacks during government meetings, for instance.\n\nMinisters, MLAs, Collector and other \u2018dignitaries\u2019 who officiate at meetings are served tea in porcelain or ceramic cups while the beverage is handed over to subordinate officials and non-officials in disposable paper cups.\n\n\u201cThe VIPs are even served costly dry fruits while we are given plain biscuits for a snack,\u201d pointed out Githe Keshav, Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency member from Gudihatnoor, who is among those who have taken objection to what they call a discriminatory practice. \u201cWe have decided to represent the matter to the authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just to denote heirarchy,\u201d stated R. Aravind Kumar, the Administrative Officer at Adilabad Collectorate whose job it is to organise official meetings of the Revenue Department.\n\n\u201cIt is an old practice,\u201d he added of the official position on the issue.\n\nThe Civil Society organisation in Adilabad, however, is in no mood to dismiss the trend lightly. \u201cIt may look trivial but the custom has a demoralising effect on subordinate staff,\u201d stated S.P. Pataskar, a retired tahsildar.\n\n\u201cMeetings should be held in an atmosphere wherein subordinate staff are not bogged down psychologically,\u201d Mr. Pataskar said. \u201cSimple things like exhibiting equality, which can be done by doing away with serving tea in different cups, can be a morale boosting exercise.\u201d\n\nAmong the non-officials who regularly face the discrimination are media persons. \u201cIt certainly seems unfair to drink tea from paper cups while top officials and leaders enjoy a sip from lovely beakers,\u201d says A. Srinivas Rao, a senior journalist.\n\nTea is served to officials and others in cups of different quality based on their status",
