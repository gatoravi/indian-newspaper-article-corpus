It also says that the actor has already benefited a lot because of furlough and parole.\n\nThe petition also levels allegations against senior prison officials for favouring Mr. Dutt and demands an inquiry into the officials\u2019 assets.\n\nA Division Bench headed by acting Chief Justice VK Tahilramani heard the petition, directed the State to file its reply and posted the matter to next week.\n\nMr. Dutt was convicted for illegal possession of an automatic assault rifle, a part of cache of arms and ammunition that landed ahead of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, in which 257 people were killed.",
