We will definitely contest the matter in the Bombay High Court,\u201d said Mr. Hazare\u2019s lawyer, Milind Pawar.\n\nMr. Hazare said the government should not harass NGOs like the BVJAN with a proven track record for fighting corruption.\n\n\u2018Government\u2019s job\u2019\n\nEarlier in June, Mr. Hazare opposed the Maharashtra government\u2019s directive prohibiting non-governmental organisations from using the words \u2018anti-corruption\u2019 or \u2018corruption eradication\u2019 in their names following allegations of \u201cdubious activities\u201d by such NGOs.\n\nJoint Charity Commissioner (Pune) Shivkumar Dighe had issued notice to 15 NGOs to strike off references to the word \u2018corruption,\u2019 the \u2018anti\u2019 prefix to corruption and affixes signifying the weeding out of corruption from their names.\n\nThe order had said that rooting out corruption \u201cwas the government\u2019s job\u201d and \u201cnot the business of so-called anti-corruption NGOs.\u201d It further directed the NGOs to rename themselves.\n\n\u201cThe BVJAN had been issued with a notice to rename itself in June last year, but they have not done so. Hence, we have issued the order to disband the trust\u2019s Board,\u201d Mr. Dighe said.\n\nDubbing the diktat permitting only official bodies and not NGOs to use the \u2018anti-corruption\u2019 tag \u201cludicrous,\u201d Mr. Hazare had said that the move was utterly unjust to those NGOs who had been doing exemplary work in tackling corruption, especially in areas where the government had failed to do so.",
