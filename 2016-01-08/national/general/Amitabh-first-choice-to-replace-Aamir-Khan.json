    "text": "India will remain incredible, says Aamir Khan\n\nActor Amitabh Bachchan, brand ambassador of Gujarat tourism, is the Modi government\u2019s first choice as the new face of its \u2018Incredible India\u2019 campaign after actor Aamir Khan ceased to be its mascot.\n\n\u201cAmitabh will be the first choice of the Ministry for the job,\u201d a Tourism Ministry source said.\n\nHe described the veteran actor as a \u201cnon-controversial\u201d figure.\n\nMr. Khan, whose comments on perceived intolerance in the country had invited flak from the BJP, ceased to be the mascot for the campaign.\n\n\u201cIt was the [private] agency which hired him. Since the contract with the agency is no more, the arrangement with the actor no longer exists,\u201d Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma said on Wednesday.\n\nAsked about Mr. Khan\u2019s removal, Mr. Bachchan said: \u201cI think you need to clarify first whether he is being removed because of something that he may have said or it\u2019s the end of his contract. I don\u2019t think that people are removed just because they did not agree or said something that is controversial.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether I am brand ambassador or not, India will remain Incredible, and that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Aamir Khan said. \u201cIt is the prerogative of the government to decide whether they need a brand ambassador for any campaign, and if so, who that ambassador should be,\u201d Mr. Khan added.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",
