Otherwise courts intervene and the suspects are bailed out.\u201d\n\nAsked about the specific information provided, the MEA spokesperson wouldn\u2019t give details, but said that \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d had reached the concerned authorities in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, the ball is now in Pakistan\u2019s court. The immediate issue in front of us is Pakistan\u2019s response to the terrorist attack and the actionable intelligence provided by it.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson\u2019s words are the sharpest public comments from the government on the Pathankot attack that left seven Indian soldiers dead.\n\nGovernment and Cabinet officials have thus far avoided pointing a finger directly at Pakistan, or of naming any particular group that is involved.\n\nHowever, sources told The Hindu that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s conversation with his Pakistan counterpart had been more candid.",
