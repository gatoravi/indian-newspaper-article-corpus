    "text": "In a significant ruling, a federal judge in San Francisco has declined to give a macaque monkey the right to his famous selfie, taken in Indonesia in 2011.\n\nThe People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a lawsuit last September asking a U.S. federal court in San Francisco to declare Naruto, a then six-year-old male, free-living crested macaque, the author and owner of the internationally famous photographs that he took himself.\n\nOn Wednesday, the judge ruled that the macaque monkey cannot be declared the copyright owner of the self-portraits. PETA had earlier said, \u201cThe U.S. Copyright Act grants copyright ownership of a \u2018selfie\u2019 to the \u2018author\u2019 of the photograph, and there\u2019s nothing in the law limiting such ownership on the basis of species\u201d. Naruto has been accustomed to cameras throughout his life, saw himself in the reflection of the lens, made the connection between pressing the shutter and the change in his reflection, and posed for the pictures he took. PETA had filed the lawsuit against photographer David J. Slater and his company, Wildlife Personalities Ltd., which both claim copyright. \u2014 IANS",
