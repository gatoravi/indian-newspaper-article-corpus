It will be done soon,\u201d said a senior government official.\n\nBesides the Ford Foundation, there are 15 other NGOs and associations which are under this restricted category. Organisations in the prior approval category are required to seek the MHA\u2019s clearance before transferring money to any bank account in India.\n\nThe U.S. government has, on several occasions, taken up the issue of the clampdown on the Ford Foundation with Indian authorities.\n\nThe move comes after the foundation registered itself under FEMA Act",
