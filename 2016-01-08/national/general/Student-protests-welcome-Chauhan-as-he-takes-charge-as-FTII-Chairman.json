The protesters were being held at the Shivajinagar police station as the first meeting of the new FTII society got under way almost six months after its reconstitution.\n\nStudents claimed that police resorted to violence despite \u201cbeing fully aware of a silent protest\u201d about to take place against the contentious appointments of Mr. Chauhan and Sangh Parivar propagandists Anagha Ghaisas, Narendra Pathak, Rahul Solapurkar and Shailesh Gupta in the reconstituted FTII Society.\n\nThe Deccan police issued notices to 17 students on Wednesday urging them to refrain from any act of protest, while warning them against attempts to \u201cdisrupt the peace on the campus\u201d. Police authorities on the spot justified their actions, stating they were compelled to remand the agitators as they refused to peacefully pave the way for the FTII society members attempting to enter the campus. The agitators were later released .\n\nThe latter part of the day proceeded uneventfully as Mr. Chauhan presided over the first meeting of the newly-constituted Governing Council since his official appointment in June 9 last year.",
