In Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency, Amethi too, the SP tasted victory. The party\u2019s candidate was elected unopposed after the Congress candidate Krishna Chaurasiya withdrew nomination, embarrassing the party.\n\n\u201cIgnoring the baseless allegations the Opposition levelled against Akhilesh Yadav, the SP\u2019s win displays the faith people have in his leadership. People have given approval to Mr. Yadav\u2019s development agenda,\u201d SP spokesperson and Cabinet Minister Rajendra Chaudhary said.\n\nOut of the 74 districts, 44 were won by women candidates, including Mulayam Singh\u2019s niece Sandhya Yadav, who was elected unopposed from Mainpuri. Mr. Singh\u2019s nephew Abhishek Yadav alias Anshul Yadav was also elected unopposed from Etawah. In Unnao, two candidates secured 26 votes each and the winner was eventually declared by a lottery.\n\nWhile the BJP and its allies claimed victory in five districts, including Muzaffarnagar and Shamli, the BSP claimed four chairman posts and the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal got one each. The Congress\u2019 lone chairman, Avdesh Pratap Singh, was elected in its bastion Rae Bareli.\n\nThe build-up to the elections saw the ruling SP take stern action against dissenters, expelling and suspending several members, including sitting MLAs. The party also replaced candidates frequently. In the end, it faced minor embarrassment in two districts, Sitapur and Bijnore, where SP rebels defeated the party candidates. Jitendra Yadav, son of rebel SP MLA Rampal Yadav, who was suspended recently for anti-party activities, defeated the official SP candidate Seema Gupta. Mr. Jitendra Yadav had been expelled from the SP. In Bijnore, suspended MLA Ruchi Veera\u2019s husband Udhyan Veera defeated the SP candidate Neelam Paras by a single vote. Mr. Veera was supported by the BJP.\n\nThe BJP alleged that the SP misused the State machinery to win the elections. Putting up a brave face, BJP State chief Laxmikant Bajpai said the SP had \u201ccrossed all limits of anarchy\u201d to \u201ccapture all the seats\u201d but could not prevent the BJP from securing some.",
