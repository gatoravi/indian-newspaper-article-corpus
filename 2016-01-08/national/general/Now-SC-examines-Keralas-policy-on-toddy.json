    "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday began hearing a batch of petitions challenging Kerala\u2019s law prescribing imprisonment if a toddy shop owner is found with brew containing over 8.1 per cent ethyl alcohol.\n\nA Bench led by Justice Madan B. Lokur was hearing the petitions by licensees and employees of toddy shops in the State, crying foul and questioning the constitutionality of a law that deprives them of their liberty and allows them to be put behind bars solely on the ground that their toddy fermented over 8.1 per cent.\n\nThe toddy shop owners argue that the 8.1 per cent bar is unrealistic and the alcohol level may quickly cross this level due to fermentation within a matter of 24 hours after tapping. They said the Abkari policy, which entails prison and revocation of toddy licence if found guilty, was impractical, and worse, arbitrary.\n\nHowever, the Kerala government stood by its stand that as a welfare State it has to ensure that consumers have the opportunity to get unadulterated and healthy alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe Bench asked both parties to place on record scientific proof in support of their respective claims.",
