    "text": "The Union government is considering a proposal to name all airports in the country after their respective cities and not personalities.\n\nGovernment sources said the decision might be a part of the civil aviation policy, which will be placed before the Union Cabinet later in January.\n\n\u201cIt is under the active consideration of the government to name all the present and future airports after the city in which it is located. This may be a part of the civil aviation policy which will go to the Cabinet,\u201d a Civil Aviation Ministry source said.\n\nAnother official said a final call had not been taken yet. \u201cWe have received different representations on this issue.\n\nThe file is still pending with the Minister,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Punjab and the Haryana governments have been locked in a tussle over naming the Chandigarh airport. While Punjab wants it to be named after martyr Bhagat Singh, Haryana has suggested an RSS leader\u2019s name.\n\nSeveral MPs have come up with similar requests to the Civil Aviation Ministry.",
