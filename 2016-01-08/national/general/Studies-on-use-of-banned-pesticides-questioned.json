We have asked the university to share the laboratory data under the RTI, but it\u2019s not being shared, raising doubts on the authenticity of these studies.\u201d\n\nThe two studies on which the inquiry is being sought are: \u201cAssessment of the concentration, distribution and health risk of organochlorine pesticide in Momordica charantia grown in Periurban region of Delhi, India\u201d and \u201cHealth risk assessment of organochlorine pesticide exposure through dietary intake of vegetables grown in the periurban sites of Delhi, India\u201d.\n\nK.K. Sharma, national co-ordinator, All India Network Monitoring Pesticides Residues, ICAR, said the findings in these studies were in stark contrast to those by laboratories functioning under the ICAR and accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.\n\n\u201cWe (ICAR) have sent three letters to the university demanding raw data. But, the latter is still dodging,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the ICAR\u2019s monitoring studies found vegetable samples carrying 2-3 per cent of pesticide residues above the maximum residue limits (MRL) while the university study claimed 100 samples exceeding the MRL.\n\n\u201cSuch studies, published outside India, negatively affect the image of the Indian agriculture industry. It is an accepted protocol and mandatory for any laboratory to maintain all laboratory records including gas chromatography readings for challenge inspection and verification post-publication,\u201d he said, adding that the citizens of the country had the right to seek the laboratory data.\n\nFarmer leader Krishenbir Chaudhary said farmers in India adopted best farming practices and it was wrong to say that they used banned pesticides.\n\nFarmer leader\n\nK. Chaudhary said that farmers in India did not use banned pesticides",
