He had later told the media that two youths had on the night of September 28, 2015, pressured him to announce from the loudspeaker of the village temple that Akhlaq had slaughtered a cow, asking the villagers to gather outside Akhlaq\u2019s house.\n\nThe priest later mysteriously disappeared. While some said he left for his village in Saharanpur, police personnel who visited his village, failed to trace him.\n\nAkhlaq\u2019s lawyer, Yusuf Saifi, plans to file an application in the Greater Noida court, where the case is under trial, to request the Chief Judicial Magistrate to call the priest, as an accused in the case.\n\nThe charge sheet lists Akhlaq\u2019s wife, mother, daughter and son as primary witnesses. The other 21 witnesses include police officials and medical staff. It was on the identification by Akhlaq\u2019s family members that the police listed 19 accused in the case.\n\nThe only material evidence mentioned in the charge sheet are the weapons recovered by the police in the aftermath of the lynching. As per the recovery memo, weapons allegedly used by the accused Rupinder, Om, Sandeep, Saurav and Gaurav, include five sticks, of which three are smeared with blood. Two iron rods with blood stains are also recovered. But these weapons did not go through forensic tests.\n\nThe case diary quotes Akhlaq\u2019s neighbours as telling the police that they were sleeping while he was lynched.\n\nThe investigation, as it is mentioned in the case diary, declares the lynching case to be a case of spontaneous reaction of people when the rumour about cow slaughter spread in the village.",
