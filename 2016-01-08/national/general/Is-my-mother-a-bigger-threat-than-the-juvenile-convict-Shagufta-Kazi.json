    "text": "Daughter of Zaibunissa Kazi wonders why her mother is not getting any concessions\n\nShagufta Kazi, daughter of one of the 1993 bomb blasts case convict Zaibunissa Kazi, on Thursday questioned the reasoning behind keeping her mother in jail when others like actor Sanjay Dutt and the juvenile convict in the Nirbhaya rape case were walking free.\n\n\u201cI met my mother in jail today. I cannot describe what I felt. At her age and in her condition, she needs to be in the care of her loved ones, not in a prison,\u201d said Ms. Kazi.\n\nActor Sanjay Dutt, who was also convicted in connection with the serial bomb blasts, has been granted remission of 103 days for \u2018good conduct\u2019. Ms. Kazi wondered why her mother was not being granted any concessions.\n\n\u201cThe conviction itself was questionable. Dutt was acquitted of TADA charges while my mother was convicted under the same Act on the basis of a bag of weapons that was never recovered. Now I read that Dutt is coming out of prison in February. More importantly, the juvenile convict in the Nirbhaya case is out of jail. Is my mother a bigger threat to society than him?\u201d she asked.\n\nZaibunissa was 75 years old when she surrendered following her conviction in 2013, and has been in jail since then. She is also suffering from several health complications and had undergone a surgery for a malignant tumour shortly before her surrender.\n\nMs. Kazi said she had been writing to the Home Department almost every month but there had not been even a hint of leniency from the government in her mother\u2019s case. \u201cSo many letters and pleas have fallen on deaf ears. But I cannot and will not give up hope,\u201d she said.",
