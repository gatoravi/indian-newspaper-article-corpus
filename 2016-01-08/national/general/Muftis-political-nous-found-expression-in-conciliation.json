    "text": "The spirit of reconciliation, of mainstreaming Kashmir\u2019s democratic politics and relentlessly engaging with separatist movements in the State, characterised the long political career of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who passed away here on Thursday. Another highlight was that he joined hands with a spectrum of political forces in that effort.\n\nHis opponent, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, termed him the \u201cgreat manipulator\u201d in an interview to The Hindu in November, while his supporters called it conciliation.\n\nOne of the last speeches that Mr. Sayeed delivered was at the India Ideas Conclave organised by the RSS-backed India Foundation in Goa in November. Departing from the prepared text, Mr. Sayeed, who became the Chief Minister of J&K for the second time with the support of the BJP in March 2015, described the unlikely alliance thus: \u201cThere was no comparable template from the past from where lessons could be drawn, where two such different partners had to form a government. When I looked at the mandate, it was clear that reconciliation had to take place.\u201d\n\nBorn on January 12, 1936, in south Kashmir\u2019s Bijbehara town, Mr. Sayeed spent the formative years of his political career in the Congress. He made his debut in 1962 from Bijbehera, after being nominated by the National Conference led by Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, who enjoyed the patronage of Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nIn 1967, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperative by Mr. Bakshi\u2019s successor, Ghulam Mohammad Sadiq. The same year people saw the first glimpse of Mr. Sayeed\u2019s political skill \u2014 he secretly joined Mr. Sadiq\u2019s main political rival, Syed Mir Qasim, to topple the government. The bid was scuttled by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nThe following years, Mr. Sayeed spent making his way into the Congress. Makhanlal Fotedar, a senior Congress leader, told The Hindu that he introduced Mr. Sayeed to the Congress high command in New Delhi, which included Indira Gandhi. \u201cHe quietly moved to the relevant circles,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Sayeed became indispensable as Indira Gandhi would consult him on Kashmir affairs.\n\nOver the course of his political career, Mr. Sayeed changed several sides. He joined the Congress in late 1960s, then moved to the Janata Dal in 1988, which chose him as Home Minister after he won the Lok Sabha elections in 1989 from U.P.\u2019s Muzaffarnagar constituency. His tenure was marred by the kidnap of his daughter Rubaiyya Sayeed by militants.",
