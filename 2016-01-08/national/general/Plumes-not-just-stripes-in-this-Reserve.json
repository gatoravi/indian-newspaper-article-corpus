Deliberations will be held on how to plan conservation projects for the bird population in the park,\u201d said Srinivasulu K., Chief Conservator of Forests and Director of the reserve.\n\nC.R. Naik, Deputy Range Forest officer, who since 2007 has been involved in the research on hornbills, said the population has seen a stark increase in the past decade, particularly since the hornbill conservatory was set up in the region.\n\n\u201cIn places like Ganeshgudi, it would be easy to spot flocks of more than 100 hornbills. The creation of non-disturbance areas for these birds has had a positive impact,\u201d he said.\n\nThe thriving flora in the forests have set up an ideal nesting ground for these birds \u2014 with some hornbills having been recorded to gorge on 168 fruits during a feeding session, he said.\n\nCeylon frog mouth, verditer flycatcher and the Malabar trogon have been spotted here",
