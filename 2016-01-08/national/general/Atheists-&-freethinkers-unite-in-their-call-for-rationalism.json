They also vowed to uphold the universal rights of children, women and the marginalised communities.\n\nEarlier, two group discussions running concurrently in the auditorium saw participants deliberating on \u2018Youth and Extremism\u2019 and \u2018Women and Social Change\u2019.\n\nModerating the debate on the first topic, Vikas Gora, Rotary World Peace Fellow and co-convenor of the conference, said many youngsters who joined the support movements had borne the brunt of decades of state corruption, poor governance, repressive regimes and poor development policies.\n\n\u201cAlthough they come from various socio-economic classes, they have witnessed or even experienced rising inequality and absence of opportunity to live a life of dignity. From Pakistan to Yemen, violence has worsened this structural injustice and military actions have further fuelled a sense of outrage,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nUrging the need for holistic economic development and psychological counselling of youth on positive and critical thinking, he said they are resorting to violence because they are deliberately not shown a constructive alternative by vested interests.\n\nNau Gora, who facilitated the other session, said religion had always subdued women\u2019s capacities. \u201cWomen should be given more economic opportunities and space to voice their concerns,\u201d she demanded.\n\nActivists from across the world come together in a conference hosted by Atheist Centre",
