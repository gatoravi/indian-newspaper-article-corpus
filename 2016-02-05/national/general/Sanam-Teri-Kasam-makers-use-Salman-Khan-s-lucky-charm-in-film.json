On Wednesday, Salman tweeted: \u201cDirectors of my film \u2018Lucky...\u2019 and \u2018Sanam Teri Kasam\u2019 churaud [stole] my song from Himesh [Reshammiya]. Lovely song. Had selected it for \u2018Tere Naam\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe song in question is titled \u2018Haal-e-dil\u2019.\n\nAsked about it, Sapru told IANS that it\u2019s the first song that appears in the film. \u201cSalman Khan is our mentor, so we do all our work keeping Salman informed about it. But as a project, we had not discussed \u2018Sanam Teri Kasam\u2019 with him. When we were discussing it and were showing everything that we have done in the film, \u2018Haal-e-dil\u2019 came up, and he said, \u2018This is my song!\u2019 He got a little upset about it,\u201d Sapru said. \u2014 IANS",
