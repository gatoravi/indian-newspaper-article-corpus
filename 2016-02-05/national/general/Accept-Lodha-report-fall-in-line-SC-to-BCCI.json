He said certain States such as Maharashtra had multiple members.\n\nHe pointed to Maharashtra, which has representations from the central province, Vidharba and parts exchanged between Karnataka and Maharashtra during the States\u2019 re-organisation post-Independence. \u201cEven if we want to comply 100 per cent with the reforms, there are legal wrangles,\u201d Mr. Naphade said.\n\nThe Justice Lodha report had been distributed among members and a meeting of its legal committee fixed for February 7, he saidBut the Bench refused to be snowballed by the Board\u2019s list of \u201ccomplications\u201d. \u201cThen we have a simple solution. We will say that since BCCI has difficulties and impediments in respecting and implementing the recommendations, let the Justice Lodha Committee continue and help the Board push through with the reforms... What do you say, Mr. Naphade?\u201d Chief Justice Thakur asked. \u201cThe recommendations are straightforward, understandable and rational... if you can\u2019t do it, we will ask the committee to steer you,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Naphade said the BCCI should not be seen as \u201cobstructionist\u201d.",
