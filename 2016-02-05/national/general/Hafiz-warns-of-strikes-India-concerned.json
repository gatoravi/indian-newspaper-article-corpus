In response, India termed the threat a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou have only seen one attack on Pathankot. Matters could easily escalate,\u201d he said at a rally in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nHe alleged that Indian troops were committing \u201cgenocide\u201d on Kashmiris, and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t they have a right to carry out Pathankot-style attacks for their defence?\u201d\n\nSaeed, in the rally on Wednesday, lauded Kashmiri militant leader Syed Salahuddin, who heads the United Jihad Council (UJC) that had claimed responsibility for the January 2 terror attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot.\n\n\u2018Rein in Saeed\u2019\n\nExternal Affairs Ministry Spokespeson Vikas Swarup said it was for Pakistan to rein in the JuD chief.\n\n\u201cHafiz Saeed is a globally designated international terrorist. His claim that his many front organisations are carrying out charitable work is not even a fig leaf. He indulges in terrorist activities and terrorist financing. It should be a matter of grave concern to everyone that terrorist like Saeed and his associates continues to enjoy the freedom to indulge in their activities,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI",
