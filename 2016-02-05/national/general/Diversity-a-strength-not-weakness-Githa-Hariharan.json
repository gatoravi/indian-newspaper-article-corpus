Vasudevan Nair, speaking at the inaugural function of the maiden Kerala Literature festival here on Thursday. Festivals were meant to celebrate literature that was the philosophy of life.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Minister for Cultural Affairs K.C. Joseph spoke on the importance of literature festivals at a time of rising intolerance. He said they played a major role in preserving the identity of languages and cultures. Writer Githa Hariharan spoke on the \u2018government of the tongue\u2019 which has gone beyond State or mob censorship. \u201cIt is no longer about preventing the tongue from asking hard questions, but about cutting it off\u201d, she said citing instances of attack against writers and intellectuals in the country. \u201cThe difference is that the forces that govern the tongue are now supported by the authorities and ideologies shared by a majority.\u201d\n\nWriter Prathibha Ray said diversity was a strength, not weakness. \u201cEach language is a star in the sky that makes it more beautiful,\u201d she said.Festival Director K. Sachidanandan presided over the inaugural function which was followed by a discussion on \u2018Literature in troubled times.\u2019 The four-day festival will see about 160 writers from across the country participating in it.
