    "text": "For, unsuccessful candidates may try to take revenge from examiners: judge\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday held that candidates in recruitment examinations can seek scanned copies of answer sheets and tabulation of interview marks under the Right to Information Act, but the right to information does not extend to disclosure of names of examiners.\n\nA Bench of Justices M.Y. Eqbal and Arun Mishra said disclosure of those who evaluated their mark sheets would not be in public interest.\n\n\u201cIf we allow disclosing name of the examiners in every exam, the unsuccessful candidates may try to take revenge from the examiners for doing their job properly,\u201d Justice Eqbal observed.\n\nThe case saw extensive arguments by senior advocate V. Giri, Supreme Court advocates Vipin Nair, P.B. Suresh and Vinod Nair for the Kerala Public Service Commission.\n\nThe apex court was modifying a Kerala High Court judgment allowing the disclosure of examiners\u2019 names under the RTI Act to candidates of the Public Services Commission Examinations.\n\n\u201cThis practice will ensure a fair play in this competitive environment, where candidate puts his time in preparing for the competitive exams, but, the request of the information seeker about the details of the person who had examined/checked the paper cannot and shall not be provided,\u201d the apex court observed.",
