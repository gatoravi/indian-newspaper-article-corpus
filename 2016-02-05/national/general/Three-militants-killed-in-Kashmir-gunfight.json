Locals alleged the explosion was aimed at demolishing the house where suspected militants were holed up.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest three militants have been killed. Some more militants are suspected to be hiding in the house.\n\nDeputy Inspector General of Police, Gareeb Das, said the operation may take time. \u201cThree militants have been killed so far, whose identity has not been identified yet,\u201d said Mr Das.\n\nThere were reports of stone throwing by locals. Para-military personnel lobbed grenade shells to disperse the protesters. The operation has been halted for the night and may resume in the morning, according to sources.",
