    "text": "GoT 6 will be epic, says Emilia\n\nEmilia Clarke, the Game of Thrones star, has promised that the sixth season of the medieval fantasy drama will be bigger and more exciting than ever before.\n\nClarke, 29, said filming it \u201clegitimately almost killed\u201d the cast and crew.\n\nThe HBO series will be returning at the end of April, with Clarke starring once again as Daenerys \u201cMother of Dragons\u201d Targaryen, in the next adaptation of George R.R. Martin\u2019s series of epic novels. The plotlines are probably the most closely guarded secret in the entertainment industry at the moment, particularly as the timeline will overtake where Martin has gone with his books.\n\n\u201cLegitimately, this season almost killed us. Like, it is epic, it is huge, it\u2019s insane, it\u2019s silly,\u201d she said.\u2014 PTI",
