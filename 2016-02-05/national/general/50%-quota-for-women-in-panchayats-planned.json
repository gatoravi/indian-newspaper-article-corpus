The Bill had first been introduced in the Lok Sabha in November 2009, after which it went through the committee process. It was re-introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2010 after the report had been tabled, after which it lapsed at the end of the 15th Lok Sabha in 2014.\n\nThe Constitutional Amendment was to ensure that 50% of total seats filled by direct elections in every panchayat be reserved for women.\n\nAmong the States that already follow 50% reservation for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are Bihar, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe Minister also made a strong pitch for the faster implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act by States for the uplift of tribals, saying that had already waited for 65 years for development.",
