    "text": "There has been virtually no decrease in call drops and improvement in the quality of mobile network coverage in recent months despite the government\u2019s tough posture on the issue, a service quality audit by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has revealed.\n\nWhile telecom firms give performance monitoring reports to TRAI every quarter, the telecom regulator has been auditing and assessing their Quality of Service through independent agencies to verify their claims since June 2015 in view of complaints about call drops and other network issues.\n\nThe audit agencies conduct sample \u201cdrive tests\u201d across various cities in the country to assess coverage quality.\n\nWhile the last two audits tested only 2G networks, 3G networks were also tested in this audit conducted in December 2015 and January 2016 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Surat and Indore.\n\nThe capital was the only region to see some decrease in call drops between September 2015 and January, but in most other cities, not a single telecom player met the TRAI standard of less than 2 per cent calls dropping after connecting.",
