However rescue efforts are still on to locate and retrieve the bodies, officials said.\n\n\u201cDemise of soldiers in Siachen is very tragic. I salute the brave soldiers who gave their lives to the nation. Condolences to their families,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted late in the day.\n\nThe soldiers belong to the Madras regiment of the Army and have been posted there recently. They include one Junior Commissioned Officer and nine soldiers.\n\nDefence Minister Manohar Parrikar too expressed \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to the bereaved families of the soldiers \u201cmartyred in the line of duty.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day a senior officer said that \u201crescue teams are braving adverse weather and the effects of the rarified atmosphere to locate and rescue survivors.\u201d\n\nA very large rescue team has been deployed to reach down to the swamped Army post. The rescuers are working at extremely low temperatures hovering between -25 to -45 degrees putting their lives at risk.\n\nAs per inputs received complete blocks of snow and ice had fallen on the post burying it very deep and clearing it was a very difficult task, the officer said.\n\n\u201cHeavy snow cutters and major equipment are being used to clear and cut the ice blocks,\u201d the officer said. A rescue dog too was flown to the spot in an Air Force Mi-17 helicopter.\n\nThe major avalanche struck the Army post in Northern Siachen Glacier located at a height of 19600 feet in the early hours of Wednesday. The Indian Army has been controlling the dominant heights of the glacier, the world\u2019s highest battlefield, since occupying it in April 1984 under Operation Meghdoot pre-empting Pakistan\u2019s move which controls heights at the lower altitudes.\n\nPakistan offers help\n\nThe Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) of Pakistan tweeted an offer to help in the search mission.\n\nHowever the Indian Army, while appreciating the gesture, declined it as \u201cadequate resources and personnel have already been pressed into service.\u201d",
