    "text": "BJP leader Prem Kumar on Thursday staged a \u201c24-hour protest\u201d against what he called deteriorating law and order situation and distress of farmers in Bihar. Dr. Kumar, who is also the Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, demanded an increase in the quota for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the panchayat polls.\n\n\u201cEveryday, incidents of murder, rape and extortion are taking place in Bihar and the government has completely failed to control them. The farmers too are forced to sell their produce to brokers as the government is not purchasing it,\u201d Dr. Kumar said outside the party headquarters here.\n\nHe also took on the Nitish Kumar government for imposing VAT charges on clothes, which has \u201csignificantly affected\u201d cloth merchants. Later in the day, BJP\u2019s alliance partner and leader of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) Jitan Ram Manjhi joined the demonstration.\n\nCrimes are on the rise and farmers being exploited, says Leader of the Opposition",
