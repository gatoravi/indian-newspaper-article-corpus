Men such as him are appropriating a naturally occurring phenomenon from older men and giving it a millennial twist.\u2014 Photo: The New York Times\n\nOn two magazine covers that singer Zayn Malik has graced in the last few months \u2014 for Billboard and L\u2019Uomo Vogue (as well as the racy video with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid) \u2014 he looks every bit the young, brooding pop star. The requisite smouldering stare, perfectly manicured stubble and bad boy tattoos are all in tow.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the hair.\n\nMalik, 23, a former member of the musical group One Direction, peers out in both images from beneath a silver mane. This isn\u2019t a case of a young man going prematurely grey, but a premeditated decision by the performer, who has a penchant for dyeing his hair and then broadcasting it to his 6.5 million Instagram followers.\n\nGus Kenworthy, the Olympic freestyle skier who came out as gay last year on the cover of ESPN magazine, debuted an ashen dye job in December on Instagram, thanking Anderson Cooper for the inspiration, adding the hashtag #50shadesofgay.\n\nThey\u2019re not alone.\n\nGone are the days when guys would actively avoid greying hair. For a new generation of adventurous men, dyeing one\u2019s hair grey is gaining traction, appropriating a naturally occurring phenomenon from older men and giving it a millennial twist.\n\n\u201cMen are embracing colour more in a general way,\u201d said Amie Rau, a stylist at Matthew Morris Salon in Denver, who dyed Kenworthy\u2019s hair. \u201cThis is an extension of that.\u201d\n\nBoth Malik and Kenworthy declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nRau said that since their first session, Kenworthy had brought in an image of a young woman with dyed grey hair as inspiration. \u201cHe kept asking me, \u2018Is it crazy that I want to do this?'\u201d\n\nAfter the ESPN cover, Kenworthy, 24, went to Rau to go platinum blond. \u201cI said: \u2018You know, you just came out to an entire nation. You should do what you want to do,\"\u2019 she recalled saying.\n\nGray and silver hair has definitely been trending, said Aura Friedman, a senior hair colourist at the Sally Hershberger Salon in New York. \u201cThe demographic of guys who come to me to go gray are doing it more as a fashion statement,\u201d she said, as opposed to a more natural look.\n\nFriedman said she has dyed the hair of Phillip Picardi, the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue, and Drew Elliott, the chief creative officer for Paper magazine, among others.\n\nInterest definitely seems to be up. A representative from Amazon said it had seen a threefold increase in the last year in customers searching for gray hair dye.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an ironic statement, especially when the wearer is noticeably young and probably years away from natural graying,\u201d said Michael Fisher, creative director of menswear at Fashion Snoops, the trend forecasting agency. \u201cIt\u2019s just another bold way to stand out from the crowd.\u201d\n\nTyler Oakley, 26, the social media personality who parlayed his online cachet into the documentary \u201cSnervous\u201d and book \u201cBinge\u201d last year, has experimented with his hair color, adopting many shades, from purple to green.\n\n\u201cGray is the favorite color I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was unique and fun, but it\u2019s not eye-catching in the way that like lilac or mint was. When I had those colors, I felt like everyone was looking at me. With gray, I felt like I was trying on a new look, but it was also relatively natural.\u201d\n\nCelebrities aren\u2019t the only ones to take the plunge. \u201cI\u2019ve always been confident, but now I feel more fun and cooler,\u201d Michael Vasquez, 30, a senior business analyst, said of his artificial gunmetal hue, now several months old. \u201cI really love it. I feel sexier.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, part of that is because of the positive response he received from friends and on social media, getting 90 \u201clikes\u201d on his Instagram account. \u201cOf course, my mom doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Vasquez said with a laugh.\n\nAchieving the silver fox look is an involved process. \u201cIn the industry, we call it a bleach and tone or a double process,\u201d Friedman said, referring to a two-part procedure in which the hair is first stripped of its natural pigment and then colored, an undertaking that can last eight hours and is often costly. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
