Are the housing needs of Mumbaiites less intense than the Bharatanatyam need of Hema Malini?\u201d the PIL asks.\n\nCalling the allotment \u201ca clear-cut case of fraud\u201d on the lines of the Adarsh housing scam, the PIL seeks that the Mumbai Police Commissioner be directed to file a criminal case against the actor and Mr. Khadse under section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security) of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant Sections.\n\n\u201cThe PIL will be mentioned before the court on Friday,\u201d Mr Tirodkar told The Hindu .",
