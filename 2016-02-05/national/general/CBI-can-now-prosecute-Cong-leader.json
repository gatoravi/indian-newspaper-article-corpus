    "text": "However, it cited no grounds for the sanction.\n\nReacting to the development, Mr. Chavan questioned the legality of the CBI seeking sanction from the Governor for the second time.\n\nIn 2013, the agency had moved a similar request under the same provisions and then Governor K. Sankaranarayanan had refused sanction.\n\nWhile rejecting the CBI request, Mr. Sankaranarayanan had stated: \u201cHaving considered the matter from all angles, the entire papers and documents, I do not find that even a prima facie case is made out and hence the request of the CBI for sanction to prosecute under Section 197 of the Cr.PC is liable to be rejected and, therefore, I am hereby constrained to refuse the same.\u201d\n\nAlleging that the CBI\u2019s re-application for sanction was done under BJP pressure to target Congress leaders, Mr. Chavan said: \u201cThe previous Governor had held legal consultations before refusing to sanction my prosecution. It is illegal on the part of the CBI to seek sanction once again from the new Governor. There is no such provision. I will fight this in court.\u201d\n\nChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis refuted the charge of \u201cvendetta politics\u201d by the BJP. He said the Governor had consulted State Advocate General Srihari Aney and he had opined that permission could be given to prosecute Mr. Chavan in the light of new facts in the case.",
