    "text": "Five years after signing the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC), India ratified the convention on Thursday, the IAEA\u2019s Office of Public Information and Communication reported from Vienna.\n\nIndia\u2019s Permanent Representative to the IAEA, Rajiva Misra, delivered the instrument of ratification to Juan Carlos Lentijo, the acting Director General of the IAEA and other officials.\n\nMr.Misra is reported as saying, \u201cWe were eager to complete the process at the earliest, and today, with India joining the CSC, we are contributing to strengthening an international convention and global nuclear liability regime\u201d.\n\nThe CSC is a convention that allows for increasing the compensation amount in the event of a nuclear incident through public funds pooled in by contracting parties based on their own installed nuclear capacities. It entered into force on April 15, 2015.\n\nIndia had also passed its own domestic nuclear liability law, the Civil Law for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act in 2010. Countries such as the U.S. have said that the Indian law\u2019s provisions are violative of the CSC, but this has been denied by India.",
