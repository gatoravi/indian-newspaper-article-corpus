    "text": "Environmental activists and legal experts who recently visited the Sunderbans have accused the West Bengal government of \u201cgross negligence\u201d in protecting the forest-dependent communities under the Forest Rights Act (FRA). Moreover, the forest officials torture the villagers in the name of forest and wildlife protection. Even women are often subjected to \u201cmolestation,\u201d claimed the activists, who include Medha Patkar, anthropologist Nandini Sundar and Kolkata-based social activist Naba Dutta.\n\nThe activists say the primary concern of the forest department officials is to protect the wildlife, including the Royal Bengal Tiger of the Sunderbans. In doing so, they are keen to extend the boundary of the core area which can be inhabited by the tigers. But in implementing their policy, the forest officials are violating the FRA, the activists claimed.\n\n\u201cProject Tiger area has recently been extended without the consent of local gram sabhas. This goes against the FRA [2006],\u201d said Ms. Patkar.\n\nShe criticised the State government for not protecting the \u201clivelihood, culture and identity\u201d of the dwellers by implementing the FRA. \u201cThe State government must recognise these rights as they have already been granted under the Act,\u201d she said.\n\nThe activists have conducted a public hearing in the islands of the Sunderbans \u2014 Shamsernagar, Gosaba, Saatjaliya, Kultali, Bali and Kumirmari. At the hearing, the villagers have alleged that \u201cthough there are no restrictions on tourists from visiting the core areas, the forest-dependent communities are prevented to visit the core area for their livelihood needs,\u201d the activists said.\n\nFact-finding mission\n\nThe national and state-level organisations that hosted the fact-finding mission followed by a public hearing on the FRA implementation in the Sunderbans \u2014 Jana Sramajibi Manch, Delhi Forum and All India Union of Forest Working People \u2014 have stated in a release that the villagers are \u201crequired to pay fines arbitrarily\u201d to forest guards. Moreover the \u201ccore area ... is changed as the Forest Department deems fit without properly informing the locals,\u201d said M. Ilango, chairperson of the National Fishworkers\u2019 Forum, who issued the release on behalf of the organisations.\n\n\u201cThey [villagers] are illegally detained, charged with false cases and their collections of the forest products are confiscated. On the other hand, the authorities do not register complaints raised by the community people, be it sexual harassment or SC/ST [Prevention of Atrocities] Act,\u201d the release said.\n\n\u201cThe women community members have filed complaints against the FD staff charging them with molestation, verbal and physical abuse. Immediate penal action should be taken against those FD staff and steps should be taken to set up a special women\u2019s cell in the region for the protection of victims,\u201d the release said.",
