[At one level] these terrorist groups and their aims and goals are known. But at the other, details of the attacks and any linkages must be discussed by the countries directly not in the media.\u201d\n\nOn Taliban talks, Dr. Abdullah said there would be \u201cno preconditions for talks with the Taliban\u201d as and when they would be resumed, holding that the only \u201credlines\u201d announced by former President Hamid Karzai, which insisted on the Taliban giving up violence and accepting the Constitution, were meant to be outcomes of the talks, and not preconditions. \u201cIf the outcome anyway violates our Constitution that is an absolute redline. If the groups want to continue links with terrorists but join the political mainstream the same time, that is an absolute redline too. Or if they want deny the rights for men and women, then that won\u2019t be allowed. But there will be no preconditions for talks with the Taliban,\u201d Dr. Abdullah said.\n\nOn the widely held perception that India had opposed talks with the Taliban, and that it was blind-sided by President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s announcement of an intelligence partnership with the Islamic State, Dr. Abdullah said this was a misconception of the media.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you see it from the outside. Within, India is kept in the loop throughout, because India has a stake in the stabilisation of the country and India has helped with stabilising Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his visit to Delhi, where Dr. Abdullah met Mr. Modi, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he discussed the upcoming meeting of the \u201cQuadrilateral Cooperation Group\u201d (QCG), made up of the U.S., China, Pakistan and Afghanistan that are facilitating the talks with the Taliban. The meeting on Saturday is expected to lead to a resumption of direct talks with Taliban leaders that were called off when it emerged that former leader Mullah Omar had been dead for several months, if not more. In the interview, Dr. Abdullah accepted that the last round of talks with the Taliban, held in July 2015, that were abruptly called off after it emerged that Taliban chief Mullah Omar had been dead for several months, were a sham, but that it was necessary to keep engaging Pakistan.",
