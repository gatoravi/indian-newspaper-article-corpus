    "text": "Reacting to submissions by BJP MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh that a Governor\u2019s official acts cannot be scrutinised threadbare by the judiciary, the Supreme Court on Thursday said the court could not be expected to watch quietly from the sidelines if \u201cdemocracy is slaughtered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf democracy is slaughtered, how can the court remain silent?\u201d a Constitution Bench led by Justice J.S. Khehar asked senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for the MLAs.\n\nThe senior advocate submitted that the Governor was \u201cduty bound to act\u201d when he realised that he was being stonewalled.\n\nMr. Naphade argued that the Governor\u2019s reports to the President were part of his constitutional compulsion to act in the face of adversity, and had he not done so, he was even liable to be removed under the Doctrine of Pleasure held by the President over his tenure.\n\nThe Bench summoned for the correspondence of the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly from last October to ascertain the circumstances which led to the Governor\u2019s decision to advance the Assembly session from January 14, 2016 to December 16, 2015.",
