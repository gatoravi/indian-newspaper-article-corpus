Kigazi, two Joint Secretaries and a representative of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations, which provides scholarships, will travel to Bengaluru on Friday, Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.\n\n\u201cWe will extend the cooperation of both the Central and State governments and will reach out to the students to reassure them that their security and well-being is our primary concern,\u201d he said.\n\nExpressing hope that the government would keep its commitment to ensure the safety of students, Mr. Kigazi said it was necessary to bring to book the 40-50 people who molested the Tanzanian student.\n\n\u201cThese students had nothing to do with the crowd\u2019s anger over a car accident by another person. Even so, they were targeted because there was anger against each and every black person,\u201d he told presspersons.\n\n\u201cThat means it was a racist attack.\u201d.\n\nMr. Swarup said External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had been in contact with the officials responsible and said she was \u201cdeeply pained over the incident\u201d.\n\nThe Ministry has often had to deal with complaint from diplomats from African nations about attacks on Africans studying and working in the country.\n\nSeveral countries took up the issue during the India-Africa summit in 2015.\n\nEnvoy says there was anger against each and every black person, and it was a racist attack",
