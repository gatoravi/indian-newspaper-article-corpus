    "text": "The arrest of suspended chief engineer Yadav Singh by the Central Bureau of Investigation has provided fresh ammunition to the Opposition in Uttar Prasad to target the Samajwadi Party government and could also expose chinks in the armour of the Bahujan Samaj Party, ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls.\n\nThe controversy suits the interests of the BJP, which plans to use the corruption charges against Singh to target both the SP and the BSP. Singh\u2019s arrest has also provided fuel to the theory that investigations in the case could reveal the names of some \u201cbig fish\u201d political leaders who shielded the engineer and benefitted from his dealings.\n\nAccused of amassing disproportionate assets and high-level corruption in awarding contracts, Singh enjoyed political clout through his career and he richly gained under the BSP and SP regimes, which parachuted him to plum positions. Starting his career in 1980 as a junior engineer in the Noida Authority, he was soon elevated to the post of assistant project manager in 1985, superseding many senior engineers, despite the fact that Singh did not have a degree.\n\nIn 1995, when Mayawati first came to power, Singh was made the project manager, and in 2002, held the key post of chief project engineer in Noida. He continued to hold political sway even under the regime of Mulayam Singh, which extended all the way to the last government of Mayawati in 2007-12, during which he was elevated as chief engineer.\n\nSoon after the Akhilesh Yadav government came to power, Singh faced allegations of irregularities in rewarding tenders and was suspended. A CB-CID probe was initiated against him. He was given a clean chit and soon re-instated.",
