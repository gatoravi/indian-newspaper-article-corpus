Officials said Agat was intercepted at the Customs counter at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai around 12.45 a.m. He was stopped and searched at the Customs counter based on a tip-off from the DRI about an attempt to smuggle foreign currency on board the flight.\n\n\u201cAgat was to be a crew member on board the Jet Airways flight number 9 W 076 to Hong Kong leaving at 2.05 a.m. on Thursday. He did not mention carrying foreign currency in his declaration. However, a search of his baggage revealed USD 3.9 lakh, which he had concealed inside leather diary covers,\u201d said an official.\n\nAgat was detained after the cash was found and was questioned by Customs officials, and later handed over to the DRI. Initial investigation has revealed that the foreign currency was attempted to be smuggled to buy gold that would then have been smuggled into the country by the airline crew, said sources.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday afternoon, a Jet Airways spokesperson said, \u201cJet Airways is cooperating with the relevant authorities in their investigation. Jet Airways has a zero tolerance policy towards actions of employees that contravene local or international laws. This is clearly stipulated in employee contracts and reinforced in training sessions. We take all necessary disciplinary action in accordance with company policy and procedures.\u201d\n\nIn the last one year, the DRI has registered several cases of smuggling which have revealed involvement either of either airlines flight crew or ground staff members.\n\nRislie Agat, a crew member, had concealed USD 3.9 lakh inside leather diary covers",
