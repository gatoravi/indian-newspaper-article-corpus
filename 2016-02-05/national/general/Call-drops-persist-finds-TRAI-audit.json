    "text": "There has been virtually no decrease in call drops and improvement in the quality of mobile network coverage in recent months despite the government\u2019s tough posture on the issue, a service quality audit by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has revealed.\n\nWhile telecom firms give performance monitoring reports to TRAI every quarter, the telecom regulator has been auditing and assessing their Quality of Service through independent agencies to verify their claims since June 2015 in view of complaints about call drops and other network issues.\n\nThe audit agencies conduct sample \u201cdrive tests\u201d across various cities in the country to assess coverage quality.\n\nWhile the last two audits tested only 2G networks, 3G networks were also tested in this audit conducted in December 2015 and January 2016 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Surat and Indore.\n\nThe capital was the only region to see some decrease in call drops between September 2015 and January, but in most other cities, not a single telecom player met the TRAI standard of less than 2 per cent calls dropping after connecting.\n\nIn Kolkata, only CDMA telecom carriers were able to meet the benchmark.\n\nNetwork coverage improved a bit in New Delhi and Mumbai, but saw no improvements in Kolkata and other cities.\n\nHowever, no telecom firm met the standards for quality of reception and voice services in New Delhi and Bhubaneswar, while voice quality has got worse in Pune.\n\nIn Mumbai, only CDMA telecom firms met the TRAI\u2019s quality benchmark.\n\nThe ability to set up a call successfully and the rate of blocked calls have improved in the case of some players in the capital and most telecom firms in Kolkata.\n\nMost telecom firms have raised doubts about TRAI\u2019s findings and sought the complete audit data trail from the regulator.\n\nOn the audit findings in Mumbai, Vodafone said there was a large variance between the summary results in \u201cyour reports vis-\u00e0-vis our own experience and information on performance of our networks\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe drive test reports shared by you should not be published,\u201d Vodafone representative Manish Gupta wrote to the regulator asking for details of the audit methodology.\n\nIdea, which operates in five of the seven cities audited, said, \u201cthe results are way different from the last tim\u2019 so it is very difficult to make any specific comments without access to the raw data on which the findings are based\u201d.",
