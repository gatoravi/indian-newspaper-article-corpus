    "text": "The Prime Minister mentioned the Narada News sting\n\nIn his maiden election speech in West Bengal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took jibes at the Trinamool Congress about the Narada News sting, but was relatively subdued in his criticism of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nCompared with his aggressive stand against Ms. Banerjee in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Mr. Modi did not refer to the investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam. He chose to explicitly underscore the achievements of the Bharatiya Janata Party over the past two years rather than launch a direct tirade against the ruling party and Ms. Banerjee.\n\nThe Prime Minister was speaking at Kharagpur in Paschim Medinipur district on Sunday.\n\n\u2018Saradha then,\n\nNarada now\u2019\n\n\u201cFirst there was Saradha [Ponzi scam] and now there is Narada [sting operation on Trinamool leaders]. The entire leadership was seen in front of the camera asking, \u2018When will you give me my next bribe\u2019,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cThe [currency] notes taken there [in the sting operation] are public money. We have been in power at the Centre for two years now and not a single allegation of corruption has been raised against us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s criticism of the Trinamool supremo was limited to the \u201cchange in her nature, intention and action\u201d after her party came to power. \u201cFrom an Opposition leader, she started behaving like an empress who does not want paribartan (change),\u201d he said.\n\nEven while comparing the 34-year Left Front rule with that of the Trinamool, Mr. Modi chose sectors such as power, health and education where West Bengal has done \u201cmarginally\u201d better under the Mamata-led government.\n\nOn law and order and industry, the Prime Minister's criticism was relatively stronger. \u201cWhile other industries are shutting down in Bengal, the only one flourishing is that of making crude bombs,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s attack on the Left-Congress tie-up was much more direct. Referring to the rivalry of the Left Front and Congress in the Kerala Assembly polls, he accused them of \u201cdoing dosti (friendship) in Bengal and kushti (wrestling) in Kerala. \u201c\n\nIn his nearly 50-minute speech, Mr. Modi directly criticised the Chief Minister only twice. Referring to her meeting with Left leaders at the State Secretariat in 2014, he accused Ms. Banerjee of joining hands with the Left and the Congress to stop the BJP and of claiming Centre\u2019s scheme of providing subsidised foodgrains to the poor as her own scheme. \u201cMoney is coming from the Centre, not the State,\u201d Mr. Modi reminded the 20,000-strong crowd.\n\nReacting to Mr. Modi\u2019s speech, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said the \u201cCentral investigation agency\u201d has \u201cslowed\u201d the investigation into the Saradha scam.",
