    "text": "The car crashed into a house after ramming several vehicles at Jayanagar in Begaluru on Sunday.\n\nA speeding luxury car, driven by a 55-year-old doctor, hit multiple vehicles over a one kilometre stretch and finally rammed into a house, killing a two-wheeler rider in Jayanagar here on Sunday. The doctor rammed at least five vehicles that left four injured, apart from the one dead.\n\nIt was around 2.15 p.m. when general physician N.S. Shankar, driving a Mercedes Benz C-200 near Madhavan Park, allegedly hit a car driven by a woman in her 20s. Fearing trouble as a crowd gathered, Dr. Shankar started driving at break-neck speed into the narrow road connecting Madhavan Park and Bhyrasandra, police suspect.\n\nThe combination of high speeds, steep gradient and narrow road became a recipe for disaster within minutes. Dr. Shankar allegedly driving in the middle of the road, hit two cars and another two-wheeler and finally rammed 52-year old tailor Rizwan Ahmed Khan, who was waiting on his two-wheeler with his wife at Bhyrasandra Circle.\n\nThe impact was such that he was dragged along with his two-wheeler till Dr Shankar rammed a mud house and came to a halt. Fortunately, the family of six who lived in the house, which collapsed in the impact, was out at the time of the accident.\n\nPolice intervened and rescued Dr. Shankar as angry residents in the vicinity dragged him out of the car and thrashed him.\n\nThe Wilson Garden Traffic Police have arrested the accused and subjected him to medical examination.",
