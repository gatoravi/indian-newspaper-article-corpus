According to my neighbours, they came in four vehicles, five autos and one jeep. The group included men and women as well as the men of the police force in plain clothes. Some of them were armed. The group was carrying a banner and asked questions about me to my house-owner and neighbours. They asked why a \u2018Naxalite Aatankawadi\u2019 had been allowed to rent a room in the village and advised my landlady to evict me,\u201d Ms. Bhatia said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThen they took out a rally in the hamlet, shouting slogans against me including \u2018Bela Bhatia Murdabad\u2019 and distributed leaflets. The leaflet accused me of being a \u2018Naxal Dalal (Maoist agent) from outside and ends with the slogan \u2018 Bastar Chhodo\u2019 (Leave Bastar).\n\nThe leaflet did not bear anyone\u2019s name or any details of any printer,\u201d claimed the researcher who has been documenting police excesses in the name of anti-Maoist operations in Bastar for over a year now. The sloganeering and leaflet campaign against Ms. Bhatia comes after the recent arrest of four journalists in Bastar and the eviction and attacks on free legal aid groups, journalists and tribal activist Soni Sori.\n\nBastar Superintendent of Police (SP) Mr. R.N. Das and Inspector General (IG) of Police S.R.P. Kalluri were unavailable for their reaction to the incident.\n\nIG is a dictator: Cong\n\nThe Chhattisgarh state unit of the Congress has termed Bastar police head Mr. Kalluri a \u201cdictator\u201d after the arrest of four journalists in Bastar in last six months.\n\n\u201cS.R.P. Kalluri has become a dictator of Bastar because of the free hand given to him by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Common people, journalists, political workers and almost everyone is on the police target in Bastar now,\u201d State Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said in a press statement on Sunday.\n\nThe campaign against Bela Bhatia comes after the attack on tribal activist Soni Sori",
