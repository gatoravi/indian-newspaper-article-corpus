We should pay respect to all religions and respect their rituals and customs. We should be respectful so that the unity of India is maintained,\u201d Mr. Modi said after the muezzin\u2019s call for evening prayers had ended. The Prime Minister then spoke for about 20 minutes more at the rally, which saw a huge turnout. \u2014 PTI",
