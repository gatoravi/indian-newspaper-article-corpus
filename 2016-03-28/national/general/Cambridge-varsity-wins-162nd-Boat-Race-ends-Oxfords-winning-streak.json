The race between the universities first took place in 1829 and is one of the oldest sporting events in the world.\n\nCambridge has led overall since 1930.\n\nRace favourites Cambridge won the toss and chose to start on the same south side of the river as Oxford\u2019s women. In rough conditions on the Tideway course, the teams began competitively but with the more experienced and heavier Cambridge slightly edging ahead while rowing more tidily.\n\nCambridge built on its advantage in the unfavourable conditions caused by strong winds, and by the time the Light Blues reached Chiswick they were set up for victory.\n\nEarlier, the Oxford women\u2019s crew won for the fourth straight time by a massive 24 lengths with Cambridge coming close to sinking. \u2014 AP\n\nCambridge, which has led the series since 1930, is ahead 82-79,\n\nwith one tie",
