    "text": "The Shiv Sena on Sunday criticised ally BJP for appointing Shrihari Aney as Maharashtra\u2019s Advocate General in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna , claiming his appointment will cost the state more than the Mughal invasion of India.\n\nAney resigned as Advocate General last week following an uproar over his remarks at a public function on the need for carving out a separate Marathwada state.\n\n\u201cThe Chief Minister is from Vidarbha and did not stop him (Aney) at his first mistake (when Aney had made a reference to this during the winter session of the Assembly). We are not questioning Aney\u2019s abilities, but his mentality. Appointing such a person as Maharashtra\u2019s Advocate General is like appointing Hafiz Saeed as Pakistan\u2019s high commissioner in Delhi,\u201d Sena MP Sanjay Raut said in his column in the Saamna .\n\nClaiming it to be a strategy to appoint Aney as AG to re-ignite the debate over separate statehood for Vidarbha, Raut said endorsement of his views by a BJP leader shows that it was well-planned ploy.",
