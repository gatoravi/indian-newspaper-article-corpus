    "text": "Like most schools in the city, Aditya Vidya Mandir in Chembur will close for the summer vacations on April 1. Only, it might not reopen in June or probably ever again, as it has no premises to function out of, and at stake is the future of a dozen-odd students with special needs.\n\nAVM is one of the few inclusive schools where children with special needs study with normal children. The Special Needs Education Unit at the school prepares these kids for mainstream schooling and helps them cope with the curriculum and individual development. \u201cEven our regular children have changed the way they look at life with a positive attitude, seeing their friends being challenged each day. We see this as the key strength of our ability to bring both sets of children on a common platform and ensure a fair opportunity to all,\u201d says a school promoter.\n\nManisha Dharmani, whose son Yug is a Class IV student at AVM, said. \u201cAVM was a blessing as it brought my child into the mainstream, unlike other schools. I am running from pillar to post to find a similar school,\u201d she told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some of their children will have to go back to special schools,\u201d says Aparna Ramanan Rajesh, co-founder, AVM.\n\nAVM was started four years ago by Radhika Dharmarajan, Kunjal Mehta and Aparna on the premises of the Chedda Nagar Education Society.",
