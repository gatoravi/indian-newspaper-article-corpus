    "text": "The BJP has said it is ready to form a government or face fresh elections in Uttarakhand.\n\n\u201cThe BJP is ready for both options. If the Governor invites us to form a government, we are ready to do so. We are also ready to face fresh polls,\u201d BJP general secretary in charge of the State Kailash Vijayvargiya said after President\u2019s Rule was imposed on the State on Sunday.\n\nThe BJP has 28 MLAs in the Assembly which has a total strength of 70 (plus one nominated member). One BJP MLA, Bhimlal Arya, is estranged from the party. This leaves the party\u2019s effective strength at 27. The Speaker had on Saturday disqualified nine rebel Congress MLAs. \u201cI have not been informed of the proclamation of President\u2019s Rule,\u201d he said in Dehradun. It is not clear whether the disqualification can stand judicial scrutiny.\n\nSenior BJP leader Bhagat Singh Koshiyari is among the front-runners for Chief Minister. The BJP has been unhappy with Governor K.K. Paul\u2019s decision to give 10 days to Chief Minister Harish Rawat to prove his majority in the Assembly.",
