The customer was understandably \u201csomewhat startled,\u201d vets said, when the box of DVDs was opened and Cupcake jumped out.\n\nAfter being contacted, an animal welfare charity collected the cat and took it to a veterinary hospital.\n\nDr. Ben Colwell, a vet at Grove Lodge who treated Cupcake, said: \u201cShe was quite dehydrated and obviously really quite scared, quite nervous. She\u2019s done really, really well, she\u2019s responded to fluids really well. Luckily she was micro-chipped.\u201d\n\nAfter scanning the cat and discovering the microchip, they found Baggott\u2019s details and got in touch.\n\nCupcake required several days of treatment for dehydration but has made a full recovery. She is now back in Cornwall. \u2014 PTI",
