    "text": "Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal took to social media to respond to The Hindu \u2019s investigation of rural electrification data wherein major discrepancies were found.\n\nThe Minister posted on his facebook page: \u201cRead media report regarding rural electrification data. Have asked my officials to visit villages & check with States to verify. Confident of showcasing the transparency brought about by GARV app but due to State level verification requirement and holiday season, some extra time may be required. (sic).\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, The Hindu reported that the Centre\u2019s claim of electrifying 7000-plus villages in the last financial year is exaggerated. Inspecting the rural electrification data on the GARV website (garv.gov.in) The Hindu found un-electrified villages were counted as electrified, among other discrepancies.",
