First people are offered something to dream about and then emotive issues are raised to engage them,\u201d said Mr. Kumar. \u201cToday, in print, electronic or social media, the debate is not on economic growth or employment-generation, but on emotional issues.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the second day of the five-day International Conference on \u201cDevelopment and Growth: Experience and Theories\u201d at Asian Development Research Institute\u2019s silver jubilee deliberations here, the Chief Minister spoke about his government\u2019s success in bringing down the number of out-of-school children from 12 to 0.86 per cent. \u201cBihar is economically poor, but it has never been intellectually weak. Bihar has always been the centre of knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kumar attributed the slow speed of industrialisation in Bihar to its narrow economic base. \u201cBihar needs Central support for its industrial promotion policy to become effective. We shall accept packages or even re-packages,\u201d he said reiterating his demand for \u201cspecial category status\u201d for the State. \u201cBihar is now seen as a destination.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke at length about the contribution of institutions like ADRI in the development of the State.\n\nLater, he criticised the imposition of President\u2019s rule in Uttarakhand. \u201cPresident\u2019s rule in Uttarakhand is a blatant assault on democracy and exposes Modi government\u2019s so-called commitment to cooperative federalism,\u201d he said in a tweet.",
