    "text": "BJP president says his party accepts the Congress challenge for a debate on the issue\n\nBJP president Amit Shah on Sunday called upon party workers to \u201claunch a nationwide campaign on nationalism.\u201d\n\nAddressing a rally of farmers in Surat, he said: \u201cThe Congress has started a strange debate on the issue of nationalism. We accept this challenge and it\u2019s the duty of every BJP worker to reach out to every household in the country to rejuvenate the love for our nation and build an army of patriots.\u201d\n\nMr. Shah, sharing the dais with Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel, charged that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi used derogatory words about freedom fighter Veer Savarkar, while its MP Shashi Tharoor compared JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar with legendary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.\n\n\u201cThe Congress is now hell-bent on insulting our national heroes. The Congress and Rahul Gandhi are now targeting Veer Savarkar in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Shah said, though he pointed out that it was Indira Gandhi who had donated Rs. 11,000 from her personal savings to build a memorial of Savarkar.\n\n\u201cThe BJP has no hesitation in accepting that Savarkar is ours. Rahul ji, you don\u2019t know anything about Savarkar. BJP workers take inspiration from Savarkar\u2019s life and his love for the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Mr. Tharoor\u2019s remarks comparing Mr. Kumar with Bhagat Singh, Mr. Shah asked how somebody who wanted the country \u201cto be broken into pieces be compared with Bhagat Singh.\u201d\n\nThe BJP president asked farmers and party workers to brace for next year\u2019s Assembly polls in Gujarat.\n\nThe Congress is\n\nhell-bent on insulting national heroes, says the BJP president",
