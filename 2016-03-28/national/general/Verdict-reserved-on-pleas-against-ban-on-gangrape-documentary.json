Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, reserving the verdict earlier this week, asked if it was right to keep the matter pending when the matter was before the trial court. The petitioners could bring the issue to the notice of the trial court, said the Bench.\n\nThree law students had filed the petitions seeking lifting of the ban on the documentary, saying it had revealed the mindset of one of the convicted rapists.\n\nOne of the petitioners pointed out that the trial court had passed an order regarding ban on the documentary film only on the basis of a first information report.\n\nThe court had earlier asked the purpose the ban on the documentary served when it was available on internet and had directed the police to state the legal provisions under which the prohibition was imposed.\n\nThe documentary was produced by British film-maker Leslee Udwin and telecast by British Broadcasting Corporation.",
