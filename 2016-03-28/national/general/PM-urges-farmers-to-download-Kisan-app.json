    "text": "Reaching out to farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat radio address on Sunday that the government was constructing five-lakh farming pools in view of the depleting water table in many parts of the country. He called upon farmers to adopt water conservation methods so that they did not suffer heavy losses if the monsoon failed.\n\nMr. Modi urged farmers to download the government\u2019s Kisan Suvidha app on their mobile phones so as to be able to access expert advice and updates on weather that would help them in farming.\n\n\u201cIf you download this app, you will get farming and weather-related information on your mobile phones. It will tell you about the state of markets, about pesticides. It will also connect you to agricultural scientists if you wish,\u201d he said in his address.\n\nMr. Modi talked about how the government was developing all the five places associated with B.R. Ambedkar on the occasion of his 125th birth anniversary on April 14.\n\nGreeting the nation on the occasion of Easter right at the beginning of his speech, Mr. Modi went on to urge students to develop some skills during their vacations. He called upon people to work towards defeating diabetes and eradicating TB from the country.\n\nMr. Modi spoke about India hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup football tournament next year, seeing this as a great opportunity for branding the country at the international level, for which immense awareness needed to be created within the country.",
