    "text": "Pins the blame on Minister Harak Singh and former CM Vijay Bahuguna\n\nWhile the BJP is being held responsible for the imposition of President\u2019s Rule in Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat, who was removed as Chief Minister, believes that an alliance between two Ministers \u2014 Harak Singh Rawat and former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna \u2014 caused the downfall of his government.\n\nMr. Rawat replaced Mr. Bahuguna as Chief Minister in 2014, and since then there has been a growing feud between their respective groups in the party.\n\nMr. Harak Singh on Saturday presented to the Press the video of a sting that showed Mr. Rawat discussing some figures with an individual, identified as a journalist associated with a Hindi news channel, in an alleged effort to win back rebel MLAs to prove his majority in the Assembly on March 28.\n\nThe press conference was co-hosted by Mr. Bahuguna\u2019s son Saket Bahuguna, who has been expelled from the Congress for \u201canti-party activities\u201d after his father\u2019s show of dissent.\n\nMr. Harak Singh had earlier told the media that the Rawat government was a \u201cone-man Army\u201d and that the Chief Minister was never available for a direct communication with the MLAs. Expressing his anger against the two, Mr. Rawat on Sunday described Mr. Harak Singh as \u201cmoney hungry\u201d and Mr. Bahuguna as a \u201cfrustrated man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the saddest episode in my life that I had to deal with a Minister in my Cabinet who was only after money,\u201d he said about Mr. Harak Singh.\n\nIn a revelation of sorts, Mr. Rawat said on Sunday that he had had to \u201ccompromise at many levels\u201d in order to maintain political stability in the State. Putting the major blame for the rift in the Congress on Mr. Harak Singh, he regretted that he could not muster the courage to sack him.\n\n\u201cI tried to control him on many occasions and that\u2019s why he became rebellious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was handling a very delicate majority. To ensure that another Harak Singh Rawat does not create political instability, I would like the number of seats in the Assembly increased from 70 to 90,\u201d he said.\n\nHe swore vendetta against the rebel MLAs. \u201cI will make these people repent,\u201d he said. \u201cRebels have no place in the Congress and they will not be accepted by the people either.\u201d\n\n\u2018I will make these people repent; the public will not accept them,\u2019\n\nsays Rawat",
