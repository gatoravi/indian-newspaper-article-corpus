    "text": "U.S. researchers have found that blowing tiny bubbles through sea water could help protect coral reefs and oyster farms from oceans, which have increasingly turned acidic through human activities.\n\nThe idea is that tiny bubbles will help cleanse the world\u2019s oceans of carbon dioxide (CO2) by drawing the gas out of the seawater and transferring it to the atmosphere. This may provide a relatively inexpensive solution to one of the biggest threats facing coral reefs today.\n\nOcean acidification harms a variety of marine organisms, but especially those that use calcium carbonate to assemble their skeletons and shells, such as coral, mussels, and oysters.\n\nThe study was published online in the journal Environmental Science and Technology . \u2014 IANS",
