Following huge loss in business, the debt-ridden Amol, along with his brother, planned a conspiracy to claim the insurance money.\n\nThe siblings befriended Ramesh, who was working in Gandhinglaj town of Kolhapur district, and offered him work for better wage.\n\nThe police said that after taking Ramesh with them, the brothers killed him and disfigured his face. Later, Amol placed some of his personal documents on Ramesh\u2019s body and replaced his clothes too to give a feeling that the murder was for gain.\n\nDuring their investigation before releasing the money, the insurance agency got suspicious as the identification marks given by Amol while applying for insurance did not match with the body.\n\nLater, the agency called the police for further investigation, which unearthed the conspiracy. The police have arrested the accused and investigation is under way.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramesh\u2019s father Krishnappa Naik said the police have not handed over the body yet. He said that Ramesh had gone to Kolhapur in November last year, and the murder took place on February 28.",
