For this, they will have to locate their families first,\u201d said the official.\n\nOfficials said they had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d for the JeM\u2019s involvement in the attack. The NIA is also expected to ask the team about the progress on the Letter Rogatory sent earlier.\n\n\u201cThe four JeM terrorists, all of whom have been identified, dialled six numbers in Pakistan.

All these places are located within 15-20 km of the Pakistan border and along the National Highway 1A, and the attacks were suspected to have carried out by JeM militants.\n\nThe NIA has found that Chawinda in Pakistan is connected to Bamiyal in Punjab, where terrorists are suspected to have infiltrated into India.\n\nThe Pakistani team will be taken to the village in Bamiyal from where the terrorists infiltrated into India.
