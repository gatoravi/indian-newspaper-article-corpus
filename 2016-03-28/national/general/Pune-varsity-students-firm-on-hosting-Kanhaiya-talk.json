With its immediate objective of hosting a talk by Mr. Kumar in the city, the forum will attempt to ensure that progressive ideas do not get \u201cstifled by the tyranny of the Right in Maharashtra,\u201d the students said.\n\nMembers of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) have allegedly threatened the journalism students with dire consequences if they attempted to host Mr. Kumar.\n\nOn Sunday, the forum took on Pune University Vice-Chancellor Vasudeo Gade following the latter\u2019s appeal to students not to disturb the peace of educational institutions.",
