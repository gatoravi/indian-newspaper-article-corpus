Now we see her granny, taking aim with a shotgun at the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? You don\u2019t recall your favorite Brothers Grimm characters packing heat?\n\nThen you must not have read the versions of classic fairy tales that have been reworked by the National Rifle Association, to help empower children by teaching them that well-armed citizens \u2014 even in the world of storybooks and make-believe \u2014 can protect themselves from those who would do them harm.\n\nThe powerful U.S. gun lobby has long made initiatives for children \u2014 the next generation of future gun owners \u2014 a key part of its outreach.\n\nThe NRA has taken its efforts a step further by reworking some of the classics from children's literature.\n\n\u201cMost of us probably grew up having fairy tales read to us as we drifted off to sleep. But how many times have you thought back and realized just how, well, grim some of them are? Did any of them ever make your rest a little bit uneasy?\u201d the NRA wrote on its website. \u201cHave you ever wondered what those same fairy tales might sound like if the hapless Red Riding Hoods, Hansels and Gretels had been taught about gun safety and how to use firearms?\u201d\n\nThe NRA enlisted writer Amelia Hamilton \u201cto present her twist on those classic tales.\u201d\n\nThe girl in the story stands little risk of being devoured by a wolf, armed with a firearm as she traverses the forest en route to her grandmother's house. \u201cRed felt the reassuring weight of the rifle on her shoulder,\u201d when she crosses paths with the wolf. \u201cHis wolfish smile disappeared for a moment when his eyes fell on her rifle,\u201d however.\n\nWhen he tries to engage her in conversation, \u201cshe shifted her rifle so that it was in her hands and at the ready. The wolf became frightened and ran away.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s grandmother finds that a gun affords protection not just in the deep dark forest, but at home too, when the wolf shows up there looking to make her his meal.\n\n\u201cThe wolf leaned in, jaws open wide, then stopped suddenly,\u201d the story reads. \u201cThose big eyes looked down and saw that grandma had a scattergun aimed right at him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be eaten today,\u201d said Grandma, \u201cand you won't be eating anyone again.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
