I demolished the walls, changed the direction of the main door and made some more changes in the house which took around two months,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018No response from firm\u2019\n\nMr. Dudihal said that when he found no positive change in his life, he contacted the \u2018vaastu\u2019 firm on many occasions, and even visited the Hubballi office but he received no positive response.\n\nHence his petition before the Consumer Forum through his advocate, P. S. Anantapur who said the case had been filed in connection with unfair trade practices and deficiency of service under Consumer Protection Act.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Dudihal told The Hindu that he was not only seeking justice for himself but also for other people like him who have approached the agency.\n\nDudihal says his life has not seen any change after he modified\n\nhis house",
