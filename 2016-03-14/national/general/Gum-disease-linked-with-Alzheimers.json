    "text": "A team of British researchers has found a link between gum disease and greater rates of cognitive decline in people with early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAccording to researchers, periodontitis or gum disease is associated with increased dementia severity and subsequent greater progression of cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cHowever, if there is a direct relationship between periodontitis and cognitive decline, as this current study suggests, then treatment of gum disease might be a possible treatment option for Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d added senior author Clive Holmes from the University of Southampton.\n\nIn the observational study, 59 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease were cognitively assessed and a blood sample was taken. \u2014 IANS",
