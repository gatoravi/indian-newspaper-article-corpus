Now, by allowing women to apply as direct-entry officers in ITBP, all restrictions have been lifted on women.\n\n\u201cWith this new rule coming into effect, women can now apply for combat roles in any of the five paramilitary forces of the country,\u201d a senior officer said. \u201cWomen will be recruited as Assistant Commandants, which is the direct-entry level for officers in ITBP. Then, they have to undergo a training of about 52-weeks after which they will be commissioned in the force,\u201d the officer said. \u2014PTI",
