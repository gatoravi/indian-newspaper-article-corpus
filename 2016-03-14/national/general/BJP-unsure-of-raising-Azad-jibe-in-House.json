This mindset suggests that Congress is glorifying terrorists and that\u2019s precisely what we are fighting against,\u201d Mr. Naqvi said.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh backed Mr. Azad. \u201cI totally endorse and support Ghulam Nabi Azad when he condemned the IS as strongly as he condemned the RSS. They are two faces of the same coin,\u201d Mr. Singh tweeted.\n\nMr. Azad kicked up a row at an event organised by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind on Saturday as he said Indian Muslims \u201coppose organisations like IS, the way we [Indian Muslims] oppose RSS.\u201d",
