Sankar (22) and his wife S. Kausalya (19), with lethal weapons. While Sankar died on the way to the hospital, his wife who suffered a head injury was admitted to the Coimbatore Government Hospital.\n\nRelatives of the girl who had opposed her marriage with the Dalit youth are suspected to be involved in the incident.\n\nThe gruesome daylight attack was reportedly captured on a surveillance camera installed in the locality. Local people even took pictures (on mobile phones) of the suspects escaping on the motorcycle leaving the victims in a pool of blood, police sources said.\n\nSankar, a native of Kumaralingam near Udumalpet, and Kausalya, a native of Palani in Dindigul district, were students of a private engineering college in Pollachi where they met and fell in love. The couple got married a few months ago against the wishes of the girl\u2019s family.",
