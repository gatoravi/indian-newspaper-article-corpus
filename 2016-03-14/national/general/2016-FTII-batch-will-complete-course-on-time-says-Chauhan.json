The Institute, notorious for its academic backlog, had frozen admissions for 2014, declaring it a \u2018zero year\u2019 to streamline academics and ensure that pending batches such as that of 2008 \u2014 that has overstayed its welcome by a record seven years \u2013 finished its course.\n\n\u201cA meeting of the academic council is due. It will review the new syllabus to make sure the new batch completes its course within the stipulated duration,\u201d said Mr. Chauhan.",
