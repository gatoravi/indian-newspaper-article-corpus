    "text": "Three persons have been arrested in connection with a case of alleged vandalism of the house of an elderly Indian-origin Chinese couple in the Tangra area on the eastern fringes of the city, police said.\n\nAccording to sources, last Tuesday morning, more than 20 people barged into the house of Liao Shee Onn and vandalised his private property. Local residents said the attack was the fall-out of a property dispute with a local promoter who had set a site on the building located on the prime land.\n\n\u201cTill now, Mr. Liao has not been able to enter his house as hooligans had broken every door of the building. The couple has not been able to enter the premises so far as they fear for their safety,\u201d secretary of the Chinese Indian Association Benn Ching Law told The Hindu on Sunday.\n\nThe attack has resulted in discontent among the local Chinese community. Mr. Law said soon after the attack, locals held a meeting and submitted a complaint to Vice-Chairman of the State Minority Maria Fernandes.",
