Earlier the production hovered around 14-15 million tonnes.\n\nIn 2013-14, the production touched an all time high of 19.78 million tonnes. However, due to inclement weather in the current season, the pulses production in 2015-16 is likely to stay at 17.30 million tonnes.\n\nFigures suggest the growth rate in pulses production during this decade has been at 2.61 per cent, which has been higher than that of rice that stands at 1.59 per cent, wheat at 1.89 per cent and all cereals together at 1.88 per cent.\n\nAgriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh in a statement said the development of transgenic pigeonpea and chickpea for resistance against gram pod borer is at an advanced stage at the Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR). Once achieved, this will help boost pulses output further and will go a long way to help the country achieve self sufficiency.\n\n\u201cIIPR is striving to intensify the breeding programme through both conventional and genomics-enabled crop improvement. It has exclusive focus on development of hybrids in pigeonpea, transgenics against pod borer in chickpea and pigeonpea, high yielding varieties with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the institute is also working towards bio-intensification of pulse-based cropping systems and resource conservation, mechanisation and minimising post harvest yield loss.\n\n\u201cClimate risk management and efficient extension models for dissemination of pulse-based technologies for farmers to make the pulse cultivation in the country productive and remunerative are also being worked upon,\u201d he added.",
