In particular it will seek out the presence of the gas methane which, on Earth, is produced by living organisms.\n\n\u201cEssentially our spacecraft is a giant nose in the sky,\u201d said Jorge Vago, an ExoMars project scientist based with the European Space Agency (Esa).\n\n\u201cWe are going to use it to sniff out the presence of methane on Mars and determine if it is being produced by biological processes.\u201d Methane is normally destroyed by ultraviolet radiation within a few hundred years of its creation. Its presence on Mars would therefore suggest life had recently been active there.\n\nThe U.S. robot rover Curiosity, which landed on Mars in 2012, initially found no sign of methane. Subsequent analyses in 2014 did report the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere in one area. However, some scientists have argued that it may have been created by non\u2014biological means.\n\nOn Earth most methane is generated biologically, but it can be made by chemical processes under the surface. To differentiate between these two processes, the ExoMars trace gas detector will not only analyse methane levels in more detail than any previous mission but also study other gases that will provide information about its likely source. \u201cIf methane is found in the presence of other complex hydrocarbon gases, such as propane or ethane, that will be a strong indication that biological processes are involved,\u201d said another project scientist, Manish Patel, of the Open University.\n\n\u201cHowever, if we find methane in the presence of gases such as sulphur dioxide, a chemical strongly associated with volcanic activity on Earth, that will be a pretty sure sign that we are dealing with methane that has come from the ground and is a byproduct of geological processes.\u201d\n\nExoMars is expected to arrive at the Red Planet on 19 October after a journey of 496m km across space, and will be followed by a second ExoMars mission, a Mars rover, scheduled for launch in 2018. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
