In that case, your kids may not be happy with you at all, say researchers.\n\nA study which delves into the dynamics of technology and families reveals that the children of those parents who sporadically text even while driving or those who indulge in over\u2014sharing on social media are not too impressed with their parents\u2019 habits.\n\nThe researchers noted that there have been similar hurdles in the past, as families grew accustomed to new technologies such as radio, television and video games in the household.\n\nHowever, the rapid evolution of technology in the past decades, along with the advent of the internet has created a wide gap between relationships, especially between parents and their children.\n\n\u201cThis challenge is exacerbated by the fact that parents themselves may be struggling to set and abide by the rules they set for themselves for technology use,\u201d the authors indicated.\n\nThe study states that as technology has become pervasive in children\u2019s lives, establishing and enforcing rules has become increasingly challenging for parents. The principal concern, among both children and parents, was paying attention to those around you instead of technology.\n\nFor the study, researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of Washington conducted a survey with 249 U.S. child-parent pairs, exploring rules both for children (aged 10-17) and parents along with enforcement challenges.\n\nThe study showed that 92 per cent of children feel that their parents need to show more interest while talking to them. The children desire that their parents should not post anything online about them, without their prior permission. \u2014 IANS",
