    "text": "This set off a furore in Parliament and outside of it, with strong criticism from women\u2019s rights activists.\n\nMs. Gandhi had essentially repeated the government\u2019s stand from April 2015, when it had said that there was no proposal to amend Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code which makes an exception to \u201csexual intercourse by a man with his own wife\u201d so long as the wife is above 15 years of age. At the time, the Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Haribhai Chaudhury, had admitted that the amendment had been refused by the government in a reply to the UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women.\n\nSince then, however, the government has agreed, along with about 150 world leaders, to adopt the 17 Goals for 2030 set out by the UNDP. At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on September 25, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the UNGA committing India to the goals which include a target of eliminating \u201call forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.\u201d The reference to private spheres is what the U.N. believes must include the criminalisation of marital rape, if India is to keep that promise.\n\n\u201cThe PM of this country went to Parliament to say the safety of women is a priority. So I wouldn\u2019t question the commitment, but we need to make it the goal,\u201d Ms. Clark said. Asked for her response to the government\u2019s submission that Indian culture doesn\u2019t accept the concept of marital rape, Ms. Clark said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear in the circles I move in at the U.N. that rape is rape. The issue is the consent of the women, and if it isn\u2019t there it is rape.\u201d\n\n(For full interview visit: http://bit.ly/1WiJJlg)\n\n\u2018PM\u2019s commitment to safety of women is not questionable, but he must make it a goal\u2019",
