    "text": "The CPI(M) Kerala committee has endorsed the candidature of Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan, and party Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan for the Kerala Assembly elections.\n\nThe CPI(M) panel, which met here as a follow-up to the two-day State secretariat meeting, wanted the party district committees to review their proposals regarding candidates as it found unacceptable the bloated list of candidates for some constituencies.\n\nThe committee directed the district secretariats and committees to meet again on Monday and send in slimmer lists. It permitted secretaries of three districts to contest the elections. This would enable Thiruvananthapuram district secretary Kadakampally Surendran, Wayanad district secretary C.K. Saseendran, and Thrissur district Secretary A.C. Moideen to fight the electoral battle.\n\nAmong the candidates figuring in the CPI(M) list is KPAC Lalitha from Wadakkancherry in Thrissur district.\n\nThe decision to field both Mr. Achuthanandan and Mr. Vijayan did not meet with any significant resistance at the State committee meeting.\n\nOnly three members reportedly expressed their reservation. But Mr. Vijayan intervened and silenced them by insisting that the issue need not be discussed by the committee.",
