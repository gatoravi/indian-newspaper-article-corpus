    "text": "An unexpected move forces AI into making mistake\n\nA South Korean Go grandmaster on Sunday scored his first win over a Google-developed supercomputer, in a surprise victory after three humiliating defeats in a high-profile showdown between man and machine.\n\nLee Se-dol thrashed AlphaGo after a nail-biting match that lasted for nearly five hours \u2014 the fourth of the best-of-five series in which the computer clinched a 3-0 victory on Saturday.\n\nLee struggled in the early phase of the fourth match but gained a lead towards the end, eventually prompting AlphaGo to resign.\n\nThe 33-year-old is one of the greatest players in modern history of the ancient board game, with 18 international titles to his name \u2014 the second most in the world. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier today...this victory is priceless. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d a smiling Lee said after the match to cheers and applause from the audience.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t hurt by the past three defeats...but I still enjoyed every moment of playing so it really didn\u2019t damage me greatly,\u201d he said.\n\nLee earlier predicted a landslide victory over Artificial Intelligence (AI) but was later forced to concede that the AlphaGo was \u201ctoo strong.\u201d\n\nLee had vowed to try his best to win at least one game after his second defeat. Described as the \u201cmatch of the century\u201d by local media, the game was closely watched by tens of millions of Go fans mostly in East Asia as well as AI scientists.\n\nThe most famous AI victory to date came in 1997, when the IBM-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat the then-world class chess champion Garry Kasparov.\n\nBut Go, played for centuries mostly in Korea, Japan and China, had long remained the holy grail for AI developers due to its complexity and near-infinite number of potential configurations.\n\nDemis Hassabis, the head of the AlphaGo developer Google DeepMind, has described Go as the \u201cMount Everest\u201d for AI scientists.\n\n\u201cLee Se-dol was an incredible player and was too strong for AlphaGo,\u201d Hassabis said after Sunday\u2019s match.\n\n\u201cIt was doing well...but then, because of Lee\u2019s fantastic play, it was pressurised into some mistakes,\u201d he said, describing the loss as a \u201cvaluable\u201d way to fix the problems with the supercomputer.\n\n\u201cActually we are very happy because this is why we came here, to test AlphaGo and its limit and find out what its weaknesses were,\u201d he said.\n\nLee said those weaknesses included a difficulty in responding to certain unexpected plays by an opponent, which led to more mistakes.\n\nGo involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a chequerboard-like grid of 19 lines by 19 lines. The winner is the player who manages to seal off more territory.\n\nOn the 78th move, Lee placed a stone unexpectedly in the middle section of the board, stunning many experts and confusing the AlphaGo.\n\nHassabis later tweeted that the AlphaGo made a \u201cmistake\u201d on the following 79th move and only realised it several moves later. AlphaGo uses two sets of \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d that allow it to crunch data in a more human-like fashion \u2014 dumping millions of potential moves that human players would instinctively know were pointless. \u2014 AFP",
