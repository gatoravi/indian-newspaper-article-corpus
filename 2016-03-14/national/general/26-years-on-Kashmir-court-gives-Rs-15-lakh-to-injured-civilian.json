    "text": "Twenty-six years after bullet wounds left an eight-year-old with an immobilised arm, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court has, in a significant direction that is bound to benefit thousands of injured civilians, granted Rs. 15 lakh as compensation.\n\n\u201cNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. The petitioner, who was working as a labourer, has been deprived of practising any profession or to carry on any profession, trade or business as guaranteed by Article 19(G). Thus, it becomes the duty of the State to adequately compensate the petitioner,\u201d observed Justice Muzaffar Hussain Attar. On December 31, 1990, Hussain Farash, a resident of the Valley, sustained bullet injuries on right side of his chest and right upper arm in cross-firing between militants and security forces.\n\nSince then Farash\u2019s right arm has been completely disabled.\n\n\u201cThe age of the petitioner at present is about 34 years and he has a whole life ahead of him. He is definitely deprived of his capacities to earn his livelihood in the manner, which he would do before sustaining the bullet injury,\u201d observed the court.\n\nThe victim\u2019s lawyer Manzoor Ahmad Dar had demanded a compensation of Rs 20 lakh, saying \u201che was the only source of livelihood for his family.\u201d",
