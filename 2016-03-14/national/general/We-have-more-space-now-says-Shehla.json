One of the allegations was that slogans of \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 were raised on the campus that night.\n\n\u201cLife has changed for the better now, as our issues were not covered much before. But now we have much more space,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe government is terrorising students with arrests. In this era of privatisation, JNU offers affordable education for everyone. Even the child of a poor man can study here along with that of a rich person,\u201d she said.\n\nSo what exactly happened on the night of February 9? Ms. Shora maintains that some slogans were raised which were not in good taste, and that the JNUSU had condemned them.\n\n\u201cNone of the JNU students was involved in raising those slogans,\u201d maintained Shehla.",
