We have approved the NIFT-designed washable blanket. The washable blankets will be used in a few selected premier trains to begin with and later more trains will be covered,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Railways has taken steps to set up state-of-the-art mechanised laundries at many stations to cater to the increased requirement of daily washing of bedrolls. \u2014 PTI\n\nLightweight blankets made of soft fabric will replace the\n\nexisting ones",
