    "text": "To discuss the controversial Land Acquisition Bill of 2015, a Parliamentary panel will meet on Monday as the government is hopeful that a consensus will emerge on all issues related to the Bill.\n\nThe Joint Committee on the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Second Amendment) Bill 2015, will take a view on the remaining clauses of the Bill. The committee has already been given at least five extensions.\n\nThe panel on December 16 decided to seek a fresh extension of its term till the beginning of the Budget session as only a few States had by then tendered their response to various clauses of the bill. At the panel\u2019s meeting on August 3 last year, the BJP had agreed to bring back the key provisions of UPA\u2019s land law and drop controversial amendments brought by the NDA government in December through an ordinance.",
