    "text": "Two months before the JNU faced a full-blown political storm, the ABVP had allegedly attempted to mobilise its cadres on \u201creligious intolerance\u201d.\n\nIn a string of social media updates, ABVP leader Saurabh Sharma, who is at the forefront of the current crisis, accused the \u2018JNU culture\u2019 of hampering religious freedoms and named a hostel warden for disrupting a religious ceremony and for indulging in caste abuse. The warden was also accused of misbehaving with a student.\n\nHowever, on the day that student leader Kanhaiya Kumar was released from Tihar jail, a local court debunked the ABVP\u2019s complaint, citing in its interim order on anticipatory bail to the warden, that \u201cthe ingredients for the offence under section 3 (1) of the SC/ST Act are not satisfied\u201d.\n\nA fact-finding committee of the university also maintained that the warden \u201cdid not resort to any caste abuse since none of the complainants were able to spell out the exact words\u201d.\n\nAccording to documents with The Hindu, in November last year, a student had organised a havan (religious ceremony) inside his room in the Jhelum hostel. Since the process involved lighting a fire, which is against the rules of the hostel, students from adjacent rooms called up the hostel wardens. Three wardens, including Professor Cleetus, intervened and the havan was stopped.",
