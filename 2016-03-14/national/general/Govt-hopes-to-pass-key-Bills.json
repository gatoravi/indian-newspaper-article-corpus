He also said that exhibiting determination to move on the reforms path, India can provide a significant amount of growth to the world.\n\nThere is a broad national consensus that the Indian economy be strengthened further so that it can attract more foreign capital, he said.\n\nThe GST Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha but is stuck in the Upper House, where the ruling NDA does not have a majority and is dependent on the support of the Congress for its passage. The Constitution amendment Bill needs two-third majority or 162 votes in the 242-member Rajya Sabha. The Congress, the original author of the GST reform, has refused to support the Constitution amendment Bill in its present form.\n\nAfter it clears the Rajya Sabha, the legislation will have to be ratified by at least half of the 29 States. Also speaking at the Conference, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the world had lots to learn from India\u2019s Aadhaar initiative that would affect revenue generation in a big way.\n\nMs. Lagarde also told reporters she didn\u2019t see much of a downside from the global economy to India\u2019s growth rate since the country has a \u201csolid\u201d growth model, a growing population, scale of market and was pursuing reforms. India, she said, has been the prime net beneficiary from low oil prices and had done well to prepare for the spill-over effects of asymmetric monetary policies of central banks across the world. She also said that an IMF team recently analysed the Central Statistics Office\u2019s new series for GDP estimates and found that it conforms to the international standards. International commentators have termed these growth estimates over-optimistic.",
