    "text": "While the bargaining over seats for the upcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal continues with fresh lists of candidates and seats being announced by the Left Front and Congress, the State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Sunday announced a fresh list indicating that his party would contest 16 more seats.\n\n\u201cToday we declared 16 more seats. Earlier in the week, we declared 75 seats out of which Joypur [Purulia district] has been removed. So there will be friendly fights in seven seats,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury addressing a press conference in his residence in Murshidabad district.\n\nHowever, till late on Sunday night, the confusion over common seats continued as the Left Front and the Congress are challenging each other in another half a dozen constituencies. In Birbhum, for instance, both sides are contesting in at least four seats.\n\nThe Front constituents, like the Revolutionary Socialist party [RSP], are also taking on the Congress in many seats and are reluctant to leave seats to their erstwhile rivals.",
