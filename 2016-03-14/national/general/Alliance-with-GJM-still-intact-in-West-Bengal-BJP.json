    "text": "A day after the Left Front declared its indirect support for the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership said on Sunday that its alliance with the Morcha was intact. The two parties had entered into an electoral alliance for the 2014 Lok Sabha election.\n\nOn Saturday, senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders said the Left Front had decided not to field any candidates in the hill districts of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. Brushing aside the Left Front\u2019s announcement, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said on Sunday that the BJP-GJM alliance was \u201cstill intact\u201d and the two would join forces in the Assembly polls.\n\n\u2018Publicity hungry\u2019\n\nQuestioning the validity of the Left Front\u2019s announcement, Mr. Sinha said that the \u201cCPI(M) is a non-entity in the hills and its support to the GJM is not of any significance\u201d.\n\nMr. Sinha dubbed the Left\u2019s decision as \u201copportunist and a publicity hungry step\u201d.\n\nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the GJM supported the BJP candidate, S.S. Ahluwalia, in the Darjeeling constituency, which has six Assembly segments.\n\nThe GJM won in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong, the Congress in Phansidewa and Matigara and the Trinamool Congress in Siliguri.\n\n\u2018CPI-M is a\n\nnon-entity in the hills and its support is not of any significance\u2019",
