    "text": "Acute funds crunch is threatening to derail the planning and development initiatives of local self-government institutions in Kerala during the initial phase of the new financial year.\n\nOfficial sources told The Hindu here that the government has neither honoured its constitutional obligation to accept the first report of the Fifth State Finance Commission nor apportioned sufficient funds to meet even the routine functions of the local governments for the next financial year. Against the commission\u2019s recommendation to devolve Rs. 8,599 crore to the local bodies, the government fixed an ad hoc budgetary allocation of Rs. 7,361 crore, which is too inadequate to address even the routine demands of the local governments. The commission had specified the allocation for each local government too.\n\nThe State government is constitutionally obliged to implement the recommendations of the State Finance Commission to ensure smooth fund flow to meet the development needs at the grass root level. This is more relevant in Kerala, which has set a model worth emulating in decentralisation of powers and funds to the local bodies.",
