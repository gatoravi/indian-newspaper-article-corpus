On the other, the decision of the DMDK to go it alone has provided the DMK an opportunity to field its own candidates in more constituencies which will otherwise go to alliance partners.\n\nAs traditional alliance partners have always preferred constituencies in their pockets of influence, the DMK was deprived of testing the waters in some areas for many years.\n\n\u201cIn Tamil Nadu, the ruling AIADMK is seen as a party with the maximum vote share. The party could achieve the distinction because it always contested in more seats in all the Assembly elections. On the contrary, the DMK adopted a policy of accommodation and liberally allotted seats to its allies. Now, we can enter the fray in more constituencies and will prove that our vote share is equally big,\u201d said former Minister Thangam Thennarasu.\n\nThe \u201caccommodative policy\u201d had cost the DMK dear in the past.\n\nIn 1980, it was forced to share 50 per cent of the seats with the Congress and the alliance came a cropper.\n\n\u2018Election after election, we have parted certain constituencies to our allies\u2019",
