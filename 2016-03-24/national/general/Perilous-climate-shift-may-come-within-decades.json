    "text": "The nations of the world agreed years ago to try to limit global warming to a level they hoped would prove somewhat tolerable.\n\nBut a group of leading climate scientists warned on Tuesday that permitting a warming of that magnitude would actually be highly dangerous.\n\nThe likely consequences would include killer storms stronger than any in modern times, the disintegration of large parts of the polar ice sheets, and a rise of the sea sufficient to begin drowning the world\u2019s coastal cities before the end of this century, the scientists declared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in danger of handing young people a situation that\u2019s out of their control,\u201d said James E. Hansen, the retired NASA climate scientist who led the new research.\n\nThe findings were released by a European science journal, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics . \u2014 New York Times News Service",
