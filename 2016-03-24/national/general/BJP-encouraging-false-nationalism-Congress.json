Congress leader Shobha Oza said the Haryana government has decided the name the airport after an RSS activist Mangal Sen.\n\n\u201cThe BJP values an RSS activist\u2019s work more than the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh ji,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows how compromised the BJP is on nationalism..,\u201d she added.",
