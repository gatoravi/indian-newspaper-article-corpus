The supply of another 500 MW through the same interconnection was also announced during Mr. Modi\u2019s Dhaka visit in 2015.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Bangladesh Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali, and Chief Minister of Tripura Manik Sarkar also addressed the inauguration via the video conference.\n\n\u201cThe sharing of bandwidth and power is yet another milestone in the development of ties between Bangladesh and India,\u201d said Ms. Hasina during the video conference, adding: \u201cBilateral ties between and Bangladesh and India have reached new heights. I am sure we will witness more joyful moments so as to bring greater benefits to our people.\u201d The Bangladesh leader also stressed: Connectivity is the next frontier of our cooperation. Ms. Hasina said \u201cthe import of electricity from Tripura fulfils yet another political commitment made by India.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi has expressed his \u2018earnest desire\u2019 to take the country\u2019s cooperation with Bangladesh to the sphere of space. \u201cI have said earlier that we should work together in the sphere of space. It is India\u2019s earnest desire that India wants to be with Bangladesh in the Bangabandhu satellite [project].\u201d\n\nMr. Modi said the two countries have \u201cset an example\u201d of how relations between the neighbours should be, of how to make an inter-dependent world.\n\nReferring to the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) connectivity deal, the Indian PM said, \u201cWe have already started working together on road connectivity. Today, we are forging a new bond through electricity sharing. We are also working together on digital connectivity, a must for the 21st century. \u201cThis means Bangladesh and India are going forward hand in hand in the spheres of land, water and space.\u201d\n\nBangladesh hopes to launch the Bangabandhu-1 Satellite by the end of 2017.\n\nAt the beginning of the conference, Mr. Modi wished Bangladesh a happy Independence Day on March 26.",
