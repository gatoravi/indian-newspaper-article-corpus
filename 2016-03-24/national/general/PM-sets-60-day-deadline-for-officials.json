At Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Modi reviewed the progress on this initiative and urged officers to speed up the pace of work, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nThe PM also asked officials to integrate all land records, presently being digitised, with Aadhaar \u2018at the earliest\u2019 and stressed that this is \u2018extremely important to monitor successful implementation\u201d of the government\u2019s new crop insurance scheme.\n\nEase of doing business\n\nCalling for further efforts to build on the government\u2019s progress in improving ease of doing business, Mr. Modi said it was necessary to create a \u2018positive perception\u2019 and noted the healthy progress among States competing for investment.\n\n\u201cReviewing the progress of provision of citizen-centric services electronically, the Prime Minister called for a comprehensive district-wise review across the country, of how many services are actually being delivered online.
