Ramakrishna\n\nSeven policemen were injured on Wednesday when they were pelted with stones by a group of students as they were taking out the body of a man found inside a water tank on the Osmania University (OU) campus, police said.\n\nTwo policemen suffered injuries on the head, Deputy Commissioner of Police (east zone), A. Ravindar said.\n\nThe students gathered in large numbers on learning that the body of a man was found in the water tank. They claimed that the deceased was a student and alleged that he had committed suicide. They demanded an inquiry. When the policemen were in the process of shifting the body for post mortem, the protesting students tried to prevent them.\n\n\u201cThe students held a dharna, raised slogans and did not allow the police to shift the body despite being shown the identity card of the deceased that established that he was not a student,\u201d Mr. Ravindar said.\n\n\u201cThey later started pelting the police with stones. The protesters were dispersed and efforts are on to nab those who hurled the stones,\u201d he said.\n\nBody identified\n\nAssistant Commissioner of Police (Kachiguda Division) Ch. Laxminaryana said the deceased was identified as a labourer. \u201cHe appears to be a drunkard and must have got inside the tank to cool himself... he apparently suffocated and drowned,\u201d the ACP said.\n\nAdditional forces were deployed on the campus following the stone pelting incident. \u2014 PTI",
