Minister for Environment Prakash Javadekar represented the government at the event as the chief guest.\n\nIn his brief speech, Mr. Basit paid tribute to Pakistan and its commitment to support regional cooperation. \u201cPakistan is a developing country and China is building a corridor across Pakistan which will help in our development process,\u201d he said.\n\nThe economic corridor is controversial in India since it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe presence of Mr. Javadekar at the event was viewed as a mood-builder for the expected summit-level meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Washington DC on the sidelines of the Nuclear Security Summit.\n\nHowever, Mr. Javadekar\u2019s presence was described by Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar as a \u201ctoken representation\u201d since he did not address the gathering following the speech by Mr. Basit.\n\nDiplomats present at the event told The Hindu that the mention of the corridor by the High Commissioner added to the buzz around the event, which was already in focus after Minister of State for Home Affairs Jitendra Singh dropped out at the last moment.",
