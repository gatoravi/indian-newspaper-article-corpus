He is currently lodged in the Arthur Road Jail.\n\nIt is alleged that the Bhujbals accepted money from contractors for awarding projects and this was then channelled into various companies they controlled.\n\n\u201cUnder PMLA, there is no provision for granting such a bail\u2026 therefore the grounds mentioned are not sustainable,\u201d ED\u2019s lawyer Hiten Venegavkar told the court.",
