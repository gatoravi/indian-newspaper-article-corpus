The new fee structure will be applicable starting with the 2016-2018 batch.\n\n\u201cThe IIMA Board has approved the increase of fees for its two-year PGPM. The amount is cumulative fee for both years, including tuition, academic support, accommodation, basic health care, medical insurance, and alumni association membership fee,\u201d a release issued by the institute stated. According to the institute, the fee hike was necessitated by rising costs and high inflation. \u201cIIMA fee increases have tended to lag inflation rate over the past several years. Taking 2009 as the base, even with the proposed increase, 2016-18 fee would be 10 % lower in inflation-adjusted terms compared to 2009-11 fee,\u201d the release stated.",
