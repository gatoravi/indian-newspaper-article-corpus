    "text": "A prototype headband to record brain trauma is being designed in Australia, researchers said on Wednesday, as sports such as football and rugby around the world grapple with how to manage knocks to the head.\n\nThe experimental brainBAND technology has sensors to record the impact on players of hits on the field. It aims to transmit that data in real time to medics, coaches and referees.\n\nNeuroscientist Alan Pearce said currently the question of whether a player is considered fit to remain on the field after a big tackle or head clash is a subjective matter debated on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s at the elite level but at the non-elite level... there\u2019s no one there to really assess them properly,\u201d Mr. Pearce, from the Swinburne University of Technology, said.\n\n\u201cUsing the device can notify in real time that a player has had a head knock so we have an objective measure for them to come off the field,\u201d he said.\n\nThe headband could also alert medics to trauma sustained from a glancing or seemingly harmless contact, he said, as the device has LED lights to indicate the severity of an impact. So the idea is that for weekend warriors if they get a head knock, they can actually take that data... to the hospital and the emergency physician has some objective data to make a more accurate diagnosis,\u201d he said. \u2014 AFP",
