    "text": "The Delhi High Court on Wednesday declined to cancel for now the six months\u2019 interim bail granted to Jawaharlal Nehru University Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar in a sedition case.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing on a batch of petitions seeking cancellation of his bail to April 28 for verification of an audio-visual material submitted to the court.\n\nCounsel R.P. Luthra, representing petitioner Prashant Kumar Umrao, submitted a compact disc (CD) containing the recording of some speeches of Mr. Kumar subsequent to his release. Mr. Luthra alleged that the tone and tenor of speeches violated the bail conditions.\n\nJustice Suresh Kait, hearing the arguments, said the court could proceed in the matter only after getting the contents of the CD verified.",
