We cannot work with the old system. It\u2019s full of rot,\u201d said Mr. Champion.\n\nAs a Cabinet Minister overseeing Mining Development Committee, Mr. Champion said that he was not allowed to eradicate \u201cmafia culture\u201d from the State\u2019s mining industry.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have access to even a single file that recorded mismanagement of our mining resources,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the police refused to cooperate. The Chief Minister [Harish Rawat] worked like a dictator. He controlled every single Ministry through his men.\u201d\n\nAfter challenging Mr. Rawat\u2019s government last Saturday, the rebel Congress leaders arrived in Delhi on Monday. Since then, they have refused to share the coordinates of their locations.",
