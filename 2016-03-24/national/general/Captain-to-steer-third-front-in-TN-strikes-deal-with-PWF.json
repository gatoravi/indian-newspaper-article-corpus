The DMDK will contest 124 of the 234 seats in the State with the other 110 to be apportioned between the four parties. The joint statement put out by the DMDK was carefully worded. It said the party was only making a seat-sharing arrangement. This meant it was not part of the PWF. The development came just days after DMK president M. Karunanidhi expressed the hope that the DMDK would eventually join them for the elections. Over the last several months, reports had emerged about the DMDK\u2019s negotiations with the PWF, the DMK and the BJP though the party had denied it. On March 10, Mr. Vijayakant declared that he would contest the polls alone, only to be corrected shortly after by his wife Premalatha, who invited \u201clike-minded\u201d parties to approach the DMDK to hold talks.",
