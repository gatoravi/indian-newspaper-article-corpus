    "text": "The National Green Tribunal has come down heavily on the UP government, its pollution control board and other agencies for delay in informing it about the quantum of domestic and industrial effluents discharged in the Ganga and warned of imposing exemplary cost on them if they did not do so within a week.\n\n\u201cBy way of last opportunity, we grant one week time for the said purpose. We make it clear that if requisite status report and projected statement is not filed within this week, we will be compelled to impose a cost of Rs 50,000 on each of the concerned respondents, including State of U.P.,\u201d a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the counsel for U.P. Jal Nigam told the Bench that it was in the process of collecting segregated data and required some more time.\n\nThe Bench, after taking note of the submissions, posted the matter for next hearing on April 5.\n\nThe NGT had asked U.P. Pollution Control Board about total quantity of domestic and industrial sewage discharge in Ganga and its tributaries like Kali and Ramganga and directed it to submit a \u201ccommonly acceptable\u201d data on the total waste.\n\nUPPCB had told the Bench that 31 towns are located in the State from Haridwar to Kanpur on the banks of Ganga and its tributaries. While 20 towns are situated on the banks of Ganga, eight are on Ramganga while three are located on the bank of river Kali, it had said.-PTI",
