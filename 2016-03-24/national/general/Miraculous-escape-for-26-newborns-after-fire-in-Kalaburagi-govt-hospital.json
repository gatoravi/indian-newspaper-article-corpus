The trio \u2014 Fakirappa and M.P. Umesh and lab attendant Ramesh Pyati \u2014 were having lunch when two air-conditioners in the ICU caught fire.\n\nThey plunged into the smoke-engulfed area and broke the windowpanes to allow smoke to escape. They also arranged for the nursing and other staff members of the hospital to shift the newborns to other wards.\n\nFire tenders arrived at the scene and doused the fire in 30 minutes.\n\nDistrict Surgeon Nalini Namoshi said a short circuit was suspected to be the cause of the fire. She said eight air-conditioners in the ICU were replaced only two months ago, and the fire had damaged one completely.\n\nMany state-of-the-art instruments, including emergency ventilators, suffered severe damage.\n\nThe rescued babies were shifted to private hospitals. Except for Mr. Fakirappa, who sustained injuries on the hands, no one involved in the rescue operations was injured.\n\nAkkamahadevi Mudabi, great-grandmother of a newborn girl, said: \u201cI have no words to explain my happiness that my great-granddaughter is safe\u2026 my granddaughter gave birth yesterday and the child was shifted to the ICU due to some health problems.\u201d\n\nHospital staff helped to shift them from the neonatal ICU where 2 air conditioners caught fire",
