The agency has alleged that Mr. Singh, as the Union Minister of Steel during 2009-2012, amassed unaccounted wealth in his name and that of his family members. His associates Anand and Chunni Lal allegedly assisted him in committing the offence.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Mr. Singh had allegedly invested unaccounted income in LIC polices by falsely projecting the amount as agricultural income.
