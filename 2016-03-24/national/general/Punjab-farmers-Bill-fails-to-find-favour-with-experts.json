However, it has kept no ceiling on the rate of interest private moneylenders can charge from farmers.\n\n\u201cAgriculture indebtedness among farmers has increased due to mismatch between input costs and minimum support prices of agricultural produce. The Bill should have focussed on increasing their [farmers\u2019] income, the root cause that makes farmers fall into the debt trap. Unfortunately, it has not been addressed,\u201d food and trade policy analyst Devinder Sharma told The Hindu , adding that farmers across Punjab were committing suicide and they needed an \u201cimmediate relief.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharma pointed out that the original proposal was to have a ceiling on interest rate that could be charged by private moneylenders, but in the Bill that had been passed no such cap on the rate of interest had been kept. The interest rate would be decided each year, on the basis of the interest rate charged by banks.\n\nThe Bill also provides that the government shall at every district set up a district agriculture debt settlement forum to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n\n\u201cWe already have debt settlement tribunals at the national level. I doubt how useful these new forums would be,\u201d added Mr. Sharma.\n\nMany farmers\u2019 unions have termed the Punjab Settlement of Agricultural Indebtedness Bill eyewash and see it as merely an attempt to win over farmers ahead of the Assembly polls due in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Bill has been drafted under the pressure of commission agents [Arthiya] and therefore, the State government has not fixed a cap on interest rates to be charged by private moneylenders,\u201d Nirbhay Singh, the president of Kirti Kisan Union, Moga, told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Singh said the State government should have made a provision to stop the practice of auctioning land or houses of farmers in case of default of loan amount. Also, a financial package should have been announced to bail out the farmers in distress.\n\n\u201cThe Bill is anti-farmer as most critical issues pertaining to farmers have not been addressed by the government. We will fight and get the Bill amended,\u201d added Mr. Singh.",
