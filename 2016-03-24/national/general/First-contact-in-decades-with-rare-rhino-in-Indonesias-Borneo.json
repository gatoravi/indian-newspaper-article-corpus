The female animal, thought to be aged around six, is now in a temporary enclosure and will later be airlifted by helicopter to a safer habitat on Borneo, Efransjah, head of environmental group WWF-Indonesia, said.\n\nThe contact with the rhino comes after environmentalists discovered in 2013 that the Sumatran rhino was not extinct on Indonesian Borneo when hidden cameras captured images of the animals.\n\nBorneo is the world\u2019s third-largest island and is shared between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n\u2018Exciting discovery\u2019\n\nMr. Efransjah, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, hailed the capture of the rhino on March 12 as \u201can exciting discovery and a major conservation success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now have proof that a species once thought extinct in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) still roams the forests, and we will now strengthen our efforts to protect this extraordinary species,\u201d he said. The capture of the rhino was a joint effort between environment ministry officials, the WWF and the Rhino Foundation of Indonesia.\n\nThe Sumatran rhino is the smallest of the living rhinos. They are the only Asian rhino with two horns, and are covered with long hair. \u2014 AFP",
