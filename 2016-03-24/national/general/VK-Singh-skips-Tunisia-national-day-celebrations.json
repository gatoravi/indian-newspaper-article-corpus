    "text": "The MEA faced an embarrassing situation due to a no-show by Gen. (retired) V.K. Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs, at an event to mark the national day of Tunisia celebrated on Tuesday.\n\nGen. Singh, who was supposed to represent the government at the event as chief guest, failed to turn up while a large diplomatic crowd starring high power diplomats stationed in the capital waited till late evening. What disturbed the hosts was that the Tunisian embassy was not informed about the Minister\u2019s unavailability and was told at the last moment, causing embarrassment to senior Tunisian diplomats. \u201cGen. Singh has apologised for not being present,\u201d said a diplomatic source associated with the event, suggesting that the chapter is now closed.\n\nHowever, what intrigued the diplomats was that apparently even senior officials from the MEA present at the venue did not know about Gen. Singh\u2019s non-availability.\n\nGen. Singh did not answer phone calls and text messages from The Hindu , though sources in his office acknowledged that he was invited by the Embassy of Tunisia, but could not make it to the event due to a Cabinet meeting.\n\n\u201cGen. Singh had to attend a Cabinet meeting chaired by the Prime Minister and the meeting continued till late in the evening. It was not possible to leave it mid-way,\u201d said an official from Gen. Singh\u2019s office. However diplomatic sources said they were disappointed by the episode which could have been avoided had the Minister informed them about his non-availability.",
