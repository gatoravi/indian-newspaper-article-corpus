The aircraft had a safe landing and all precautionary measures were put in place. After landing, the passengers were immediately evacuated from the aircraft. The Airbus A320 aircraft was taken to an isolation bay at the Delhi airport, where a thorough search was being carried out till late on Wednesday.\n\nPassengers were also searched after de-boarding and all baggages were checked. According to sources at the airport, nothing suspicious was found on-board the aircraft.\n\nSenior officials of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) said that the other flights that had taken off from Delhi were searched after these landed at their respective destinations. These flights were IndiGo's 6E 591 (Kolkata-Dibrugarh), 6E 516 (Delhi-Chandigarh), 6E 443 (Delhi-Chennai), 6E 135 (Nagpur-Pune-Ahmedabad), 6E 223 (Mumbai-Kochi), 6E 612 (Delhi-Dehradun), 6E 329 (Delhi-Goa), 6E 571 (Delhi-Dibrugarh), 6E 161 (Delhi-Ahmedabad) and 6E 734 (Delhi-Vadodara).\n\nCalling from U.S.\n\nThe threat call was made using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and the caller claimed that he is calling from the U.S. and got the details about the bombs from Pakistan. \u201cWhile the other flights had already landed by the time the information was received, the call regarding flight 6E 853 was specific and that is why it was rigorously checked,\u201d said a senior Delhi Police official.",
