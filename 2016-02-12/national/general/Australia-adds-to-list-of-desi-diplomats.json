    "text": "The power of the Indian diaspora came back in focus with the announcement of Australia\u2019s new High Commissioner to India.\n\nHarinder Sidhu, an Australian born in Singapore and of Indian origin, is expected to arrive in Delhi next week. Announcing Ms. Sidhu\u2019s appointment, the Australian High Commission said it \u201ccontinues a tradition of Australian representatives with strong connections to India\u201d.\n\nA previous envoy, Peter Varghese was also of Indian origin, and is currently the Foreign Secretary of Australia (Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).\n\nMs. Sidhu comes after Richard Varma, who became the US\u2019s first Indian-Origin Ambassador, and Nadir Patel, Canada\u2019s High Commissioner to India, were both posted to New Delhi. There is even speculation about the soon-to-be announced British High Commissioner.\n\nFormer diplomats say the trend was something India frowned upon in the past, but is more welcome now.\n\n\u201cAs Indians climb up to senior government positions in these countries, it would be natural that more will be sent to India,\u201d said former Ambassador Neelam Deo, Author at Mumbai-based think-tank Gateway House. \u201cIf they are only being sent because they are of Indian-origin, that would not be so welcome, as they would be seen as lightweight,\u201d Ms. Deo said.\n\nFormer deputy NSA Latha Reddy said the growing practice of Indian-origin diplomats being posted to India has been successful so far. \u201cThe special connect with India gives them an advantage in dealing with their Indian counterparts,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a result, ambassadors are expressing that \u201cspecial connect\u201d quite openly. When U.S. Ambassador Mr. Varma went on a visit to his ancestral village near Jalandhar last summer, he was accompanied by crowds and wide media coverage. Mr. Patel spoke publicly about his conversations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi being conducted in Gujarati.\n\nMs. Sidhu too said she has always been \u201cfascinated by the country of my heritage and am keen to learn more about India \u2014 its language, culture and history \u2014 while I am there.\u201d",
