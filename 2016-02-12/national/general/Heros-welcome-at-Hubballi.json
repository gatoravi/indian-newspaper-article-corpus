Slogans like \u201cHanumanthappa Amar Rahe,\u201d \u201cBharat Mata Ki Jai,\u201d \u201cVande Mataram\u201d rent the air as the vehicle carrying the mortal remains moved out of the airport.\n\nMr. Siddaramaiah announced a compensation of Rs. 25 lakh to the kin of the soldier, a government job to the soldier\u2019s wife and a plot.\n\nWanted to be a soldier\n\nA pall of gloom descended on Betadur, hometown of Hanamanthappa, after news of his death reached the village.\n\nHanamanthappa, who is survived by his wife and a daughter, belonged to a farming family in this village in Dharwad district of Karnataka. He walked 6 kilometres every day to study at the high school at Aralikatti village.\n\nThe youngest in the family, Hanamanthappa always wanted to be a soldier. Despite being rejected thrice in the Army recruitment rallies at Belagavi, Dharwad and Gadag, he persisted and finally managed to get into the 19 Madras Regiment 14 years ago.\n\nHe married Mahadevi (Jayashri) four years ago. Their daughter, Netra, is two years old.\n\nHis earnings helped his family build a house on a government-allotted site in the village. His last visit to Betadur was six months ago.",
