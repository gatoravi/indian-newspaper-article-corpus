    "text": "The BJP on Thursday demanded that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar apologise for calling Ishrat Jahan \u2018Bihar ki Beti\u2019 (daughter of Bihar), soon after David Coleman Headley told a Mumbai special court that she was a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative.\n\n\u201cNow, Mr. Nitish Kumar should apologise to the country. To garner votes, he had called a terrorist \u2018Bihar ki Beti.\u2019 The Congress, [RJD chief] Lalu Prasad and Mr. Nitish Kumar eye votes. The BJP does not take the help of terrorists to garner vote,\u201d BJP MP from Nawada and Union Minister Giriraj Singh said.\n\nIn July 2013, severing ties with the BJP, Mr. Nitish Kumar called Ishrat Jahan \u2018Bihar ki Beti\u2019 because she had spent her childhood in the State.

Today, it has become clear that it was not a fake encounter, and they should take back their statements,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Mr. Nitish Kumar and his party should not politicise everything.\n\nAccording to information accessed by The Hindu , Ishrat had spent her childhood at Jamalpur in Munger district in Bihar where she studied up to Std. II in St. Roberts School. At that time, her maternal grandfather, Abdul Majid, was working at the Jamalpur railway factory. Later, he went to Alamganj in Patna. Ishrat\u2019s grandparents were living at Khagaul, near Patna, and her father Shamim Raza started a business in Patna but shifted his base to Mumbai.\n\nJD(U) leader Ali Anwar said: \u201cDavid Headley is not Yudhistra\u2026 Give him Padma Bhushan or any other award for whatever he has said.\u201d",
