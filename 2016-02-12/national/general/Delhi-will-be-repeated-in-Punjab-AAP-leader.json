We don\u2019t have the bandwidth in U.P.\u201d\n\nAsked about the AAP\u2019s plans for the 2019 general elections, Mr. Kejriwal said he would respond in 2018.\n\nAsked why he practised the politics of confrontation, the Chief Minister said he and his party were at the receiving end as displayed by the actions of the CBI.\n\n\u201cI am willing to do anything to avoid confrontation,\u201d the Chief Minister said. \u201cWhen I speak up [against the Centre], people say I am fighting with the Centre.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Minister said his decision last year not to keep any portfolio with him had worked well for the government\u2019s functioning.\n\n\u2018We are at the receiving end of Centre\u2019s actions\u2019",
