    "text": "Demanding an apology from the Congress over the Ishrat Jahan encounter case in light of David Headley\u2019s deposition, BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma cited the comments of Congress leaders questioning the Batla House encounter and their allusion to the hand of the RSS in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. \u201cIt has become clear that the Congress played with national security,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the BJP wants to stand with those who have been accused by the CBI in a Gujarat High Court-monitored process that they were complicit in the fake encounter, they can go and stand with them in a court of law,\u201d Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said. \u201cThere is nothing which stops the BJP from doing that\u201d\n\nHe said the metropolitan court in Ahmedabad first concluded that this was a \u201cstaged encounter, in other words, a fake encounter.\u201d The Gujarat High Court monitored the CBI probe, and the agency concluded that the encounter was fake. It filed charge sheets against the accused in a court, he said. \u201cSo, therefore, if the government or the BJP wants to use David Coleman Headley\u2019s testimony to justify an encounter which a court-monitored probe has found to be fake, then neither the law and nor jurisprudence allows it,\u201d Mr. Tewari said.",
