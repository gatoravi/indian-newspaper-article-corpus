Thakur on Thursday dismissed an appeal filed by law student Gaurav Sureshbhai Vyas against a September 2015 Gujarat High Court order upholding a clampdown on mobile Internet access under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) during the Patidar agitation as only \u201cminimal restriction\u201d and not a violation of free speech which extends to Internet access.\n\n\u201cIt becomes very necessary sometimes for law and order,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur remarked while rejecting the appeal.\n\nThe dismissal of this appeal gives full credence to the Gujarat High Court\u2019s view that blocking of Internet mobile facility is an \u201cappropriate action\u201d in situations \u201cprone to aggression.\u201d The High Court had opined that the State should be left to figure out an \u201ceffective approach\u201d like blocking Internet on mobiles in order to maintain law and order.\n\nThe Division Bench had reasoned that rioting had taken place in several parts of the State and it was only natural that the government would be \u201czealous\u201d to control a violent situation. Further, the High Court had reasoned that only mobile Internet service was blocked and not Wi-Fi and broadband facilities.\n\n\u201cHad there been a complete ban on Internet access, may be through mobiles or may be through Wi-Fi, the matter might stand on a different footing and different considerations,\u201d the High Court order said.\n\nUpholds Gujarat HC\n\norder backing a clampdown on mobile Net access during Patidar stir",
