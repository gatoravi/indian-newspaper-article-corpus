    "text": "Leslie Bassett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer known for his lush sonorities and ecumenical instrumentation, died on February 4 in Oakwood, Georgia. He was 93. His family confirmed the death.\n\nA master orchestrator who could coax a vast range of tonal colours from the bits of wood and brass for which he composed, Bassett wrote works for symphony orchestra, chamber and choral ensembles, solo instruments and voice.\n\nAt his death, he was the Albert A. Stanley distinguished university professor emeritus of composition at the University of Michigan, where he had taught from 1952 until his retirement in 1992.\n\nBassett received the Pulitzer in 1966 for \u201cVariations for Orchestra,\u201d which had been given its United States premiere by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy the year before.\n\nFeatures of the piece\n\nThe work, about 24 minutes long, displays many hallmarks of his style: compositional techniques encompassing both the tonal and the atonal; a sonic intensity heightened, in particular, by the exuberant use of woodwinds and brass; and an abiding concern with instrumental texture.\n\nPerformed extensively\n\nOver the years, Bassett\u2019s compositions were performed by the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Juilliard String Quartet.\n\n\u201cVariations for Orchestra\u201d was recorded by the Baltimore Symphony under Sergiu Comissiona as part of Composers Recordings Inc.\u2019s American Masters Series. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
