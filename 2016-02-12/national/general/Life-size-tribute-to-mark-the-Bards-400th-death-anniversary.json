    "text": "A life-size art installation featuring over a dozen of Shakespeare\u2019s famous creations handcrafted from paper and cardboard to mark the legendary writer\u2019s 400 death anniversary, is causing much ado about \u2018something\u2019.\n\nThe show at Birmingham City University, which displays scale models over six feet tall, a three-metre-high balcony and even a walk-in tavern, has been made as a tribute to mark 400 years since the Bard\u2019s death.\n\nEach piece in the installation was individually crafted by 22 first year students from the University\u2019s Design for Theatre, Performance and Events degree course. They used techniques learned on the course to sculpt 780 meters of corrugated cardboard and nearly 5,000 metres of brown paper into the entire setting and characters.\n\nAmong the figures on show are a likeness of Shakespeare writing at his desk and full size replicas of some of theatre\u2019s most famous names \u2014 including Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear and Caliban.\n\nFruit of labour\n\nThe exhibition took nearly three weeks to create, with students working day and night to make each setting, character and item from scratch, as well as selecting music and lighting to complement each element.\n\nThe installation housed in the Shell space at the University\u2019s Parkside building in Birmingham city centre is open to the public until February 26.\n\nHollie Wright, Module Leader for the project, said: \u201cThe project is a simple yet extremely effective approach to experiential learning.\u201d\n\nThe tavern in the installation is intended to replicate London\u2019s historic Gorge Inn, where history\u2019s most famous playwright is believed to have penned many of his works. \u2014 PTI",
