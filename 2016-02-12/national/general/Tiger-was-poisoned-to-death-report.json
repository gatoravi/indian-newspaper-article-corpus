    "text": "An adult tiger that was found dead near a private farm at Pazhamputhur village on upper Kodaikanal hill on Wednesday evening was poisoned with Carbofuran, one of the most toxic pesticides to control nematode worms, veterinary surgeons confirmed after autopsy on Thursday.\n\nThe forest officials said that Carbofuran was scattered around the spot where the carcass of the tiger was found. They strongly suspected that some locals might have mixed the poison in the remains of the mule, which was mauled by the tiger in their village four days ago. Kodaikanal DFO D. Venkatesan said that veterinarians in Kodaikanal and Pannakadu did the autopsy in the presence of NGO members and forest officials.\n\nThe carcass was intact. There were no injuries on the tiger\u2019s body.\n\nFive samples of the dead mule and tiger were sent for forensic test. Locals said that a horse was found dead with injuries near the village four days ago.\n\nWhen they informed about the attack, the DFO assured to release suitable compensation immediately. Farm owners used corral mules at this spot and after the attack on one mule, they feared that the tiger would maul the rest of them. Some one might have mixed poison in the remains of the mule with an aim of killing the tiger as they believed it would return to eat the leftover meat.\n\nTwo special teams have been formed to investigate the case further.",
