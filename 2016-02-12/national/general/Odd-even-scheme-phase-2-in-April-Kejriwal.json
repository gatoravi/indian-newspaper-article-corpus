VIPs, women and two-wheelers will continue to be kept out of the ambit of the scheme,\u201d he said, while admitting that the Capital\u2019s transport infrastructure was ill-equipped to handle the extra footfall of an estimated 20 lakh two-wheeler riders, that dropping them from the list of exempted categories was bound to entail.\n\nTaking a jibe, most ostensibly at Robert Vadra, who recently criticised the scheme, the Chief Minister said while VIPs\u2019 vehicles would remain exempt, he hoped they would take a leaf out of the book of the Chief Justice of India, who willingly chose to comply with its provisions and took to car-pooling with his colleagues during the implementation of the first phase of the scheme between January 1 and 15.",
