    "text": "He has no role to play in issues prescribed in Tenth Schedule: SC\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday questioned Governor J.P. Rajkhowa\u2019s authority to concern himself with the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly Speaker\u2019s powers to disqualify legislators under the anti-defection law.\n\n\u201cHow can the Governor take away the constitutional powers of the Speaker to disqualify lawmakers on the grounds of defection? The Governor has no role to play in issues prescribed in the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection provision) of the Constitution,\u201d a five-judge Constitution Bench led by Justice J.S. Khehar observed.\n\nQuestioning the Governor\u2019s interventions in the wake of Speaker Nabam Rebia disqualifying 16 of the 21 rebel Congress MLAs, the Bench had earlier also asked whether the Governor had any powers to \u201cmonitor the Tenth Schedule powers of the Speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocracy is a basic structure of the Constitution and if some decisions are anti-democratic, it is the subject matter of judicial review,\u201d the Bench, also comprising Justices Dipak Misra, Madan B. Lokur, P.C. Ghose and N.V. Ramana, said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court questioned the Governor\u2019s use of his \u201cconstitutional discretion\u201d to advance the sixth session of the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly by over a month, asking whether it was backed by sound constitutional principles.\n\nThe advancing of the session from its scheduled date of January 14, 2016 to December 16, 2015 in order to remove Speaker Nabam Rebia triggered the entire political crisis, leading to imposition of President\u2019s rule on January 26.",
