The inter-district train service in the Valley was also suspended. The authorities sealed several areas in Srinagar. Parts of north Kashmir, including Bhat\u2019s village Trehgam, witnessed stringent security restrictions. The separatist JKLF organised programmes in Trehgam, Gilgit-Baltistan and also in the United Kingdom.",
