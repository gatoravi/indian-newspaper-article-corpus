The confusion around the number of terrorists who hid inside the airbase still continues.\n\nRocky got burns on the left leg when he was sent inside the billet on January 4, to check whether there were any survivors, almost 12 hours after the building was blown up.\n\n\u201cRocky went inside and dragged a pouch out of the rubble. The surface was still burning as a lot of explosions had taken place inside. We suspect that the pouch belonged to one of the two terrorists inside the billet. When we opened it, there was a grenade pin inside, it has been handed over to the NIA\u201d said a top NSG official, who was part of the operations.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu , the presence of two more terrorists inside the airbase was detected only on January 3, more than 30 hours after the engagement with the first set of four terrorists started.\n\nThe January 2 attack on the air force base left seven security personnel dead.",
