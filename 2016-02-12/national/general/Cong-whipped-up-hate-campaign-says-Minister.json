    "text": "Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the \u2018hate in India\u2019 campaign on alleged incidents of intolerance was artificially built up by the Congress at a time when the Centre was promoting the \u2018Make in India\u2019 (MII) initiative.\n\nWith most investors saying the passage of Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill by Parliament in the coming Budget session is crucial for MII and Start-up India\u2019 initiatives to be successful, Ms. Sitharaman told The Hindu that the investors\u2019 concern on the delay in implementation of the GST \u201cmust be taken to the people who do not want the GST, including the Congress party.\u201d\n\nHer comments come in the backdrop of Congress leaders claiming that India will not be able to attract investment through the MII initiative because of \u201cincreasing\u201d instances of intolerance and attacks on minorities. The Congress also alleged that the BJP was unwilling to engage in discussions on the GST.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018hate campaign\u2019 in this country. If they (Congress) want to artificially build up a campaign that does not exist, it is they who have to answer,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the problem of inverted duty structure (where the duty on inputs/raw materials/components is higher than that on the finished product) affecting local manufacturers, the minister said she was hopeful that the coming Budget would address this issue.\n\nShe said the recent government decision to do away with customs duty exemption on life-saving medicines could boost the MII programme, adding that the government would ensure that its initiatives under the MII comply with the World Trade Organisation\u2019s norms.\n\nRejecting reports that the government could allow 100 per cent FDI in the \u2018market-place model\u2019 of e-commerce, Ms. Sitharaman said these were \u201cmere speculations.\u201d\n\nWithdrawal of customs duty exemption on life-saving medicines will boost the MII programme",
