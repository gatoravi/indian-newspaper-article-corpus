    "text": "Punjab Congress on Thursday accused Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal of following an \u201canti-national agenda\u201d by attempting to evoke extremist sentiments in Punjab and cautioned that the party would not let Mr. Kejriwal visit the State unless the AAP dropped its \u201cpolitics of supporting extremism.\u201d\n\nCongress\u2019 Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu told The Hindu : \u201cWe will not allow Arvind Kejriwal to visit Punjab if the AAP does not change its agenda for the upcoming Assembly elections in Punjab. They (AAP) are following an anti-national agenda by backing extremists for political gains.\u201d\n\nMr. Kejriwal, however, denied the allegations that his party had any nexus with Khalistanis, saying the Congress was doing \u201cphoto-shopping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Congress is setting up our photos with (Jarnail Singh) Bhindrawale and putting them on posters,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said in New Delhi.\n\nIt may be recalled that circulation of unattributed pamphlets and social media messages pairing the Delhi Chief Minister alongside Bhindranwale, the spearhead of the Khalistan movement, with a message of celebrating Bhindranwale\u2019s birth anniversary and \u2018fulfilling his dream\u2019 had created disquiet in Punjab\u2019s political sphere.\n\nFollowing this, the Congress and the BJP accused the AAP of adopting a \u201cfanatic agenda\u201d by supporting a Khalistani ideologue.\n\nMr. Bittu said the Congress would protest against Mr. Kejriwal, adding that he would personally lead the demonstration to stop the latter along with the 35,000 families affected by terrorism. \u201cHis (Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s) cavalcade won\u2019t be allowed to enter either from Rajpura or Shambhu areas,\u201d Mr. Bittu said.\n\nMr. Kejriwal is likely to visit Punjab from February 22 for 4-5 days and is expected to meet families of farmers who committed suicide due to debt and also those families that have become victims of drug menace.\n\n\u201cMr. Kejriwal will tour villages across the State and meet the families of debt-ridden farmers to understand the issues affecting them,\u201d said AAP State convener Suchha Singh.",
