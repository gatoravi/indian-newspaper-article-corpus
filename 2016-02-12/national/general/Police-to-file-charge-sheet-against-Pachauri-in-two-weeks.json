Pachauri. A trial court on March 21 last year had granted anticipatory bail to Mr. Pachauri.\n\nThe Delhi Police, which filed a status report on the investigation in the case before the Delhi High Court on Thursday, said its probe had revealed that an out-of-court settlement was offered to the complainant, and a former Research Associate, through whom the offer was allegedly made, had complained to the police about it last month.\n\nPlea to cancel bail\n\nThe Bench led by Justice S.P. Garg hearing the complainant\u2019s petition seeking cancellation of Mr. Pachauri\u2019s anticipatory bail has directed the police to submit the case records by Monday and reserved its order on the plea filed by the 29-year-old research analyst, who has now quit the TERI.\n\nGoes on leave\n\nPTI reports:\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pachauri proceeded on leave on Thursday and will skip TERI\u2019s convocation on March 7.\n\nMr. Pachauri\u2019s decision to proceed on leave came after a group of students refused to receive degrees from him.",
