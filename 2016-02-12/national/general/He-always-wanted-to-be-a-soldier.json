He walked 6 kilometres every day to study at the high school at Aralikatti village. The youngest in the family, Hanamanthappa always wanted to be a soldier. Despite being rejected thrice in the Army recruitment rallies at Belagavi, Dharwad and Gadag, he persisted and finally managed to get into the 19 Madras Regiment 14 years ago.\n\nHe married Mahadevi (Jayashri) four years ago. Their daughter, Netra, is two years old. His earnings helped his family build a house on a government-allotted site in the village.\n\nHis last visit to Betadur was six months ago.
