    "text": "At a meeting of constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and BJP president Amit Shah this week, one of the issues that came up for discussion was the government\u2019s shift in stand on minority status to Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia. Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan termed the government\u2019s stand \u201cdiscomforting and an unnecessary controversy.\u201d\n\nThe Union government on January 11 this year, changed its affidavit in a case challenging the minority status of AMU and JMI to say that the two universities could not be granted that status as they had been set up by Parliament.\n\nMr. Paswan raised this issue during the dinner meeting held for NDA allies at Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu\u2019s residence in the presence of Mr. Shah. According to sources, \u201cMr. Paswan said these were established institutions and the government\u2019s shift in stand may also infringe on the right of State governments.\u201d\n\nAt this, Mr. Shah said the Centre was proceeding as per sound legal advice and there was enough to support the Centre\u2019s affidavit.\n\nMr. Paswan said the controversy could snowball as there were many minority institutions in the country, including several prominent ones in Delhi like the St. Stephen\u2019s College and the Khalsa College.\n\nAccording to sources present at this meeting, SAD leader Sukhbir Badal supported Mr. Paswan\u2019s contention that the move could open a can of worms.",
