Sheikh bin Zayed also had a restricted meeting at 7, Race Course Road, with Mr.Modi. The Ministry of External Affairs initially announced four agreements but revised the list later adding five more agreements.\n\nAnwar Gargash, UAE\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told The Hindu that both sides had reached an understanding on a wide range of issues and the agreements signed on Thursday were the beginning of a new era of bilateral cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe have common interest in fighting terrorism and, therefore, we have an agreement to counter terror in the cyber field. Defence collaboration is also progressing well,\u201d said Dr.Gargash, highlighting that a great deal of bilateral cooperation had taken off since Mr.Modi visited UAE in 2015.\n\nHowever, the much anticipated agreement on India accessing UAE\u2019s Sovereign Fund was not declared on Thursday. \u201cIndia should carry out some structural changes in its economy to facilitate such an agreement,\u201d Dr.Gargash said.\n\nDr.Gargash said India and the UAE had begun a dialogue that would firm up a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council.",
