    "text": "The former Gujarat police officer, D.G. Vanzara, said on Thursday that Ghazwa Times , a Lashkar-e-Taiba mouthpiece published from Lahore, had said Ishrat Jahan was a member of the terror outfit. \u201cBut the matter was politicised and taken in a different direction as part of a political conspiracy. Today, the lid has been blown off and we have been vindicated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when the United States would not grant a visa to certain leaders of our country. Today, a citizen of the same country has turned approver for us and said for the world to hear what we have always maintained,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the encounters carried out by the Gujarat Police were genuine, and the charges levelled against the police were false. \u201cThere was a sustained political conspiracy in which Ishrat was depicted as an innocent college student who was gunned down by us. I ask you if she was innocent, what she was doing with two men who were confirmed to be Pakistani nationals,\u201d he asked.\n\nAsked how Ishrat being a LeT member justified a staged encounter, Mr. Vanzara said the authenticity of the encounter was for courts to decide. \u201cI will not talk about the details of the encounter as the matter is sub-judice. However, a charge sheet is not the final word in a case. The courts will decide whether or not the encounters were fake,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to a statement by Ishrat Jahan\u2019s mother Shamima Kauser, raising doubts about Headley\u2019s statement, Mr Vanzara said: \u201cIt is her right to raise doubts. But whatever Headley has said has been said in a court in accordance with the law.\u201d",
