    "text": "Social networking giant Facebook on Thursday pulled the plug on its controversy-ridden \u2018Free Basics\u2019 programme in India, days after telecom regulator TRAI barred operators from charging discriminatory rates for Internet access based on content. \u201cFree Basics is no longer available in India,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said.\n\nThe service was offered in India in partnership with Reliance Communications and was earlier known as Internet.org. While there was no response from RCom, sources said it takes up to 48 hours to stop such a service. Launched in 2014, Facebook is running the programme across 17 countries. \u2014 PTI",
