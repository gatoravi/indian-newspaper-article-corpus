Sivan said besides VSSC, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) and ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) were working on developing electric propulsion system for use on satellites.\n\n\u201cIn two years, we may be able to achieve it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the cryogenic engine for GSLV Mark-III will be undergoing stage-level test soon and the target to achieve flight test is December this year.\n\nRegarding Chandrayaan-II, he said the objective was to land a rover on the moon and carry out in-situ experiments. ISRO was also developing various technologies required for a manned mission, which was yet to be approved by the government.\n\nDirector of High Energy Materials Research Laboratory, a DRDO facility, K.P.S. Murthy said their lab was developing a table-mounted explosive detection kit, which could be used for detecting explosives, including deeply concealed ones. He said the Advanced Centre of Research in high Energy Materials, University of Hyderabad, was collaborating in the project. The kit could be used in airports and other places.\n\nEarlier addressing the conference, Dr. Satish Kumar, Director-General (Missiles and Strategic Systems), DRDO, said rapid changes were taking place in warfare technology and called upon researchers to work on developing insensitive munitions.",
