    "text": "This will incentivise encounters, say activists\n\nWith the Jammu and Kashmir hiking the reward money for police personnel killing a militant by 25 per cent, human rights groups in the State have expressed the fear that there would be an increase in encounters rather than arrests.\n\n\u201cThis is an attempt to incentivise extrajudicial killings. When there is a reward money of Rs.12.5 lakh, why would they arrest a militant?\u201d asked Khurram Pervez, coordinator of the Valley-based rights group, Jammu and Kashmir Coordination of Civil Society (J&KCCS), which has unearthed thousands of unmarked graves in the State.\n\nAccording to a J&KCCS survey, there was a sudden increase in the killing of militants from 1998 and decline in arrests, just months after the reward money for counter-insurgency policemen was increased by almost 50 per cent by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.\n\nThe revised policy on rewards, approved in November last year, enhanced the reward money from Rs.10 lakh to Rs.12.5 lakh for \u201cA plus plus\u201d, the highest category of a wanted militant. Similarly, there is a hike in the categories of militants of \u201cA plus\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d.\n\nHowever, the complex categorisation, where a militant\u2019s longevity and his armed actions are factored in before the Inspector General of Police assigns him a category, has further complicated this unaccounted kill money.\n\nIronically, the police in Pulwama weaned away more than 34 youths from joining the militancy. \u201cSuch efforts fetch no rewards, despite being a tedious, multi-layer exercise,\u201d said a top police official on the condition of anonymity.",
