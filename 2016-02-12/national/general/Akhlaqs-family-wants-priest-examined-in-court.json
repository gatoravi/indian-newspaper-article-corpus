According to Akhlaq\u2019s daughter Shaista\u2019s testimony, soon after the announcement, a mob dragged Akhlaq outside the house and lynched him.\n\n\u201cMinutes after the announcement was made from the temple loudspeaker, we found that a crowd was outside our house, pushing the main door while hurling abuses at my father. Soon, they broke the door and dragged him out and lynched him,\u201d she told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Saifi told The Hindu that Mr. Sukhdas\u2019 claims about making the announcement were on record. \u201cIt was the announcement which led to Akhlaq\u2019s lynching. So he has to be made accountable to the law and be examined about his role in the entire episode,\u201d added Mr. Saifi.\n\n\u201cWe want to examine if he actually made the announcement. The other question we want to ask him is that why did he run away from the village if he did not do any thing wrong,\u201d Mr. Saifi told this correspondent on phone from Greater Noida.\n\nHe had allegedly announced that Akhlaq had slaughtered a cow which led to lynching",
