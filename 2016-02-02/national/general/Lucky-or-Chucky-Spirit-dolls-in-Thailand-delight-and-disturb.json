In the morning, she likes to drink strawberry milk,\u201d she added.\n\nOn first reckoning, it sounds like the everyday observations of a dedicated mother.\n\nExcept the daughter Natsuda refers to isn\u2019t real. Certainly not in the living, breathing flesh and blood sense.\n\nShe is a meticulously groomed plastic doll, part of the latest celebrity- fuelled superstitious craze that has swept the country \u2014 much to the dismay of the kingdom\u2019s conservative military rulers.\n\nKnown in Thai as \u2018luuk thep\u2019 (child angels), the pricey dolls, which can cost up to $600, were first popularised a little over a year ago by celebrities who claimed dressing up and feeding the dolls had brought them professional success.\n\nBelievers say the dolls \u2014 many of which are blessed and have sacred scripts drawn on them by a monk \u2014 contain the spirit of a real child and must be treated as a living being.\n\nThe theory runs that those who look after their dolls like members of the family, will see good fortune returned to them.\n\nAs a result, plastic dolls are now taking their seats at restaurant tables, cinemas and even on airplanes. Natsuda, 45, lives with her very real 21-year-old daughter. But that has not dimmed her affection for the doll, auspiciously named Ruay Jang (So Rich).\n\n\u201cSince I got Ruay Jang my life has really changed. For example, I won the lottery which I had never won before,\u201d she explained. After praying for help from her doll, she added, a friend paid back a significant loan after years of fruitless efforts to chase it down.\n\nThe \u2018luuk thep\u2019 craze appears to have divided Thais.\n\n\u201cI freak out sometimes when I see them on the train,\u201d admitted Lakkhana Ole, a 31-year-old graphic designer from Bangkok who says she spots dolls increasingly often around the city. \u2014 AFP",
