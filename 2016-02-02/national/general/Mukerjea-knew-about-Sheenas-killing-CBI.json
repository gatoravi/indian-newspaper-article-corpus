    "text": "The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday yet again objected to the bail application filed by media executive Peter Mukerjea in connection with Sheena Bora murder case.\n\nMukerjea was arrested on November 19, 2015, and has been lodged at the Arthur Jail ever since. He filed his bail application on January 23 which was rejected by the CBI on the same day, stating it had evidence in the form of a statement by his wife, Indrani, prime accused in the murder, that she had informed Peter about Sheena\u2019s murder immediately after her body was disposed of in Raigad.\n\nAppearing for the agency, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh said that Mukerjea was against his son Rahul\u2019s relations with Sheena and said that he intentionally concealed the incident from the police.\n\nMr.Singh informed the court that there were several long duration calls between Peter and Indrani during odd hours which were not usual. He said Peter was an influential person and could have done a lot to find about Sheena once she went missing.\n\nSenior counsel Amit Desai, representing Mukerjea, said he had no objection to Rahul\u2019s relationship with Sheena. The prosecution had intentionally suppressed the messages sent by Peter through his driver congratulating Rahul on his engagement with Sheena.\n\nPeter knew his wife Indrani didn\u2019t approve of their relation hence he had sent these messages through his driver\u2019s phone, Mr.Desai contended.\n\nHe argued that there had been no material against Peter either with the police or the CBI and now they were citing a statement of Indrani recorded on December 15, 2015, to justify Peter\u2019s arrest made on November 19, 2015, almost a month prior to it.\n\nThe arguments will continue on February 6.",
