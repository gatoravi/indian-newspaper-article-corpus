Though there were suggestions to increase the number of items to over 70, or even allow trade in all items barring a few (called the negative list), the final list is being worked out. \u201cThe final call has to be taken by the External Affairs Ministry. These items were suggested on the Jammu and Kashmir government\u2019s request as they wanted to promote items produced in the State itself. It also depends how and when Pakistan responds to a meeting of the Joint Working Group, which has yet not been held,\u201d said the official.\n\nSuggestions received by the government to improve the cross-LoC trade include better physical infrastructure (such as roads) and telecom systems.",
