Apart from being the V-C of UoH, he is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the National Council of Rural Institutes (NCRI) in Hyderabad, an autonomous body that falls under the MHRD.\n\nThe additional charge was handed over to Mr. Rao on January 7 this year, said D.N. Dash, Member-Secretary of the NCRI.\n\nMr. Rao, however, said he had not applied for the post but was handed down the designation by a direct order from the MHRD. While he has not been intervening much in the office matters of the NCRI so far \u201cdue to unrest on the UoH campus,\u201d he is actively holding the post. \u201cThis is a different institute and the duty was entrusted on me. I had not applied for it,\u201d Mr. Rao said.\n\nNCRI officials were, however, not able to explain the process involved in selecting Mr. Rao for the post.\n\nThe students are angry about Mr. Rao holding the additional charge.\n\n\u201c The MHRD has not considered the demand that during a judicial inquiry into Vemula\u2019s death, the V-C should not be in office,\u201d said a JAC representative.",
