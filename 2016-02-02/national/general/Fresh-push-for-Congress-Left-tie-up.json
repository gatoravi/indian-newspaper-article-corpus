But the Congress\u2019s minority cell chairman in the State, Khalid Ebadullah, who was not part of the delegation that met Mr. Gandhi, said the party should go it alone. \u201cWe have a great chance to make a fresh start\u201d, he told The Hindu , adding that Mr. Chowdhary wanted the CPI(M)\u2019s support to save his constituency from the Trinamool. \u201cMamata has made his life hell. She is after his workers, harassing them.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that Muslims, who earlier voted in large numbers for the Left, were disenchanted with it because of its \u201cgodless\u201d philosophy. He also accused the Left of killing many Muslim leaders. In a State with a 30 per cent Muslim population, Mr. Ebadullah\u2019s view could be significant, and is one that the Trinamool is hoping will turn out to be correct.\n\nIndeed, Trinamool Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP, Saugata, dismissed the likelihood of a Congress-Left arrangement jeopardising his party\u2019s prospects. He argued that even though the percentage of votes polled by the Left parties (29%) and the Congress (10%) \u2013 that had fought the Lok Sabha polls separately \u2013 taken together equalled that of the Trinamool (39%), it would not work in their favour. \u201cThe Congress and the Left parties have fought each other for so many years that they will not be able to transfer their votes to each other,\u201d he said. Besides, the Congress\u2019s votes are not evenly distributed over the State, he said, being largely confined to the districts of Malda, Murshidabad and North Dinajpur.\n\nAmid speculation that the Trinamool, in a bid to block a possible Congress-Left alliance, might offer to enter into an arrangement with the Congress, both Mr. Roy and the party\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP, Derek O\u2019Brien, ruled it out. \u201cWe are going it alone,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. Mr. Roy said that the Trinamool had been performing well consistently in both local and by-elections in the past 20 months. Since it did exceedingly well in the Lok Sabha polls, winning 34 out of 40 seats in the State, there was no need for entering into an alliance with any party.\n\nThe Left is keenly watching the developments in the Congress camp. \u201cReflecting the mood of the people of West Bengal, we have given a call to the Left, democratic and secular forces to throw out the authoritarian regime of Mamata Banerjee and asked political parties to declare which side of the fence they are on,\u201d CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Mohammad Salim said, adding, \u201cThere is a growing groundswell of anger against the Trinamool that is visible in the mass mobilisation that we have been doing.\u201d\n\nMr. Salim, however, clarified that the Left had not yet made any overtures to the Congress, or vice versa: \u201cWe understand that Congress leaders are meeting to take a view. Let them come back to us,\u201d he said, stressing, \u201cBut we are very clear that we need to respect the people who are eager to oust this government.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Left sources said that after the Congress makes a proposal, its Central committee and Polit Bureau would meet to take a final view.",
