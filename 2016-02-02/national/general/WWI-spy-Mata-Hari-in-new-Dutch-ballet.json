She was just 41.\n\nIn the years before the war, her daring striptease act had brought her notoriety, fame and adoration and she\u2019s widely regarded as one of the world\u2019s first-ever exotic dancers.\n\nNow her story is being told \u201cen pointe\u201d for the first time.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make a dramatic ballet... and I was looking for a subject matter to create dance, so there had to be a connection with dance,\u201d said Ted Brandsen, Dutch National Ballet director and the show\u2019s choreographer.\n\n\u201cMata Hari was a person who always fascinated me and she was Dutch. A lot of people actually don\u2019t know that,\u201d Mr. Brandsen said.\n\nThe idea of creating a major new ballet began four years ago \u2014 and when Brandsen shared his plans with two-time Grammy-nominated British composer Tarik O\u2019Regan, it all came to life.\n\nMore than 60 dancers will perform during the two-hour production featuring a kaleidoscope of experiences from Mata Hari\u2019s life.\n\nMuch of the ballet is set in Paris, where she kept a string of lovers said to include famous Italian composer Giacomo Puccini.\n\n\u201cMuch like Mata Hari had a fast-paced life, so do we want to tell her story in a fast-paced way on stage,\u201d said Brandsen.\n\nRichly complementing the dance, is a wardrobe of more than 300 lavish costumes designed by Francois-Noel Cherpin \u2014 who began working on the designs three years ago.\n\nDeep inside the company\u2019s building next to the Amstel River, Brandsen and his co-producers are hard at work.\n\nPrinciple dancer, Russian ballerina Anna Tsygankova, glided effortlessly through rehearsals.\n\n\u201cTo touch upon her life story is a great opportunity for me to get to know Mata Hari better,\u201d Ms. Tsygankova, who trained at the Bolshoi ballet, said.\n\n\u201cShe is an enigma to me. Who can say for sure? Was she just a dancer? Was she really a spy, or perhaps a victim of her circumstances?\u201d\n\nAfter a rancorous divorce from a Dutch officer in the colonial army left Zelle penniless, she fled to Paris in 1904 to start a new life.\n\nThere she quickly reinvented herself as \u201cMata Hari\u201d, an Indonesian word for \u201cEye of the Day\u201d and adopted Javanese dancing in an erotic act that often left little to the imagination.\n\nFame of her \u201cexotic beauty\u201d quickly spread across Europe and almost overnight she became a celebrity, who also raised eyebrows for her many affairs. \u201cShe went to Paris and completely reinvented herself. That idea is what intrigues me about her,\u201d said Mr. Brandsen. \u201cShe became comparable to somebody like Madonna, or Lady Gaga today. She became famous very quickly.\u201d\n\nBy 1914 however her popularity was waning and she found herself in Berlin when war broke out.\n\nShe was recruited by the Germans to spy on France and Britain. But today it is widely believed she never really took the deadly business of spying seriously, but rather agreed because of the money \u2014and the glamour.\n\nAfter trying to reach the front to meet a young Russian officer, her lover at the time, Mata Hari was arrested by a French officer and charged with being a double agent.\n\nOn a cold October morning she was shot in the Parisian suburb of Vincennes.\n\nOn the day of her execution, Mata Hari is said to have declined a blindfold and blew kisses to her executors.\n\n\u201cShe died with her head held high,\u201d Mr. Brandsen said. \u2014 AFP",
