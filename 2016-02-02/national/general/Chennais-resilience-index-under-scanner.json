    "text": "On Monday, the Greater Chennai Corporation set about updating the climate and disaster resilience index for its zones.\n\nThe exercise has become necessary in the light of the December deluge, which has given the lie to certain conclusions in the resilience index prepared in 2010. Besides that, the previous index is silent on the added areas.\n\nSome localities in the older sections of the city that were considered resilient to flooding were hit badly during the rain. On Monday, the first meeting involving officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation, NGOs, representatives from consultant firms and experts from countries such as The Netherlands was organised at Ripon Buildings.\n\nWork on the assessment of the physical, social, economic, institutional and natural resilience of all the zones, calculated on the basis of 125 variables, will be completed shortly. Some of the variables include percentage of road network, interruption after rain, availability of trained emergency workers and healthcare after disaster.\n\n\u201cThe city is currently dealing with the aftermath of the unprecedented 2015 floods, focussing on preparation of systems that will prevent similar crises. The city has to bounce back. The revised index will help civic agencies take measures to help the affected people,\u201d said an official of Greater Chennai Corporation.",
