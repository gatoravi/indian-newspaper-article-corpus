The food-grain requirements would increase with the rise in population in the coming years and to ensure the food security for the people, the public stock holding was necessary so that requirements under the National Food Security Act could be met.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider the public stock holding as a distortion in the market as it is important for us to provide access to food at affordable prices to our growing population. Besides, sufficient stocks need to be maintained to ensure availability in case of a crop failure in a situation where more than half of the agriculture production is received from un-irrigated areas,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Badal expressed concern that absence of SSM would expose the domestic market to the cheap imports from the developed countries and would impair the agricultural production and thereby the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers of the country.\n\nWTO ministerial meeting at Nairobi in December, 2015 ended with a declaration which welcomed the progress on Doha development agenda. The WTO General Council has been mandated to regularly review the progress of these negotiations and meeting is likely to be held early this month.\n\n\u201cNairobi declaration provided that the members should pursue the negotiations on an SSM for developing country members in dedicated sessions of committee on agriculture in a special session. Similarly, regarding public stock holding for food-security purposes, the member should engage constructively to agree and adopt a permanent solution to the issue,\u201d Mr. Badal wrote in the letter.",
