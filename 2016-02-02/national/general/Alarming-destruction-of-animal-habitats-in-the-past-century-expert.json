However, India appeared to have a stronghold in terms of tigers.\n\nAjay Desai, an elephant ecologist, said elephants had a strongly bonded social group and a defined home range and seasonal range. Speaking on \u2018human wildlife conflict \u2014 a perspective on Asian elephants and tigers,\u2019 he said: \u201cThey have a social dominance, hierarchies which control and regulate space.
