They sought a directive to the Centre to cancel the allotment of subsidised land to the DDCA.\n\n\u201cThere is a grave apprehension that the CBI will not be able to conduct a free and fair investigation, especially since Arun Jaitley, during whose tenure as president most of the offences occurred, is now a senior Minister and Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha,\u2019\u2019 they said.\n\nThe petitioners submitted that the election by a proxy system in the DDCA had been perpetuating a fraud on the genuine members, including the petitioners, by ensuring that certain persons remained office-bearers perpetually.\n\nThe petitioners said Justice (retd.) Mukul Mudgal had found several irregularities and indicted the DDCA\u2019s working committee.\n\nCourt allows Jaitley\u2019s plea\n\nMeanwhile, a Delhi court on Monday allowed a plea by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley seeking summoning of certain records of the DDCA in a criminal defamation complaint. Mr. Jaitley has filed the complaint against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders.\n\nIn the application filed before chief metropolitan magistrate Sanjay Khanagwal, Mr. Jaitley had sought summoning of DDCA records for the period during which he was its president.",
