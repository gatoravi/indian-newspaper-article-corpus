    "text": "The Goa government on Monday sent out a strong message that it would not buckle under pressure and reiterated that commercial operations of helicopter joyrides would take off this week for the benefit of tourism in the State. The message issued through a spokesperson comes after fresh protests against the launch of helicopter joyrides from Aguada-Sinquerim in north coastal Goa on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe new venture is an agreement between two government organisations [Pawan Hans and State-owned Goa Tourism Development Corporation] and anyone taking the law into their own hands will be dealt with seriously,\u201d warned the statement.\n\nThe GTDC and Pawan Hans said the joyrides would not cause noise pollution, nor affect the eco-sensitive areas of Aguada. On Monday, Goa Church-affiliated Centre for Responsible Tourism opposed the heli-tourism services.\n\nThe local people and local church authorities in Sinquerim say it will harm the bio-diversity of Aguada plateau and the business activities there.",
