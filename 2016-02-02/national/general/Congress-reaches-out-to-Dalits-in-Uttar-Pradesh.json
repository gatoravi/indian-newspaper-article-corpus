    "text": "The Congress is looking to Dalits to reverse its fortunes in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls and is reaching out to the community through the grassroots Bhim Jyoti Yatra.\n\nLed by Bhagwati Prasad Chaudhary, Congress ST/SC cell chairman, the party on Monday launched the second phase of its yatra. It will pass through 14 districts of Kanpur, Chitrakoot, Jhansi and Allahabad divisions.\n\nThe yatra will cover 84 Assembly constituencies before concluding in Lucknow on February 8.\n\nThe main purpose, U.P. Congress chief Nirmal Khatri said, was to correct the \u201cmisconception\u201d created around Babasaheb by those looking to seek \u201cpolitical mileage\u201d out of his legacy.\n\n\u201cIt is to counter the negative message sent out to Dalits about the Congress and alert them,\u201d Mr. Khatri said.",
