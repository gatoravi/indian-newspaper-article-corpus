They had broken through a layer of barricades when police decided to take them on physically.\n\nStudents alleged that the policemen did not discriminate between male and female protesters, as they swirled their lathis and punched them.\n\nBut the sharpest reactions were reserved for some men in plainclothes, alleged to be RSS workers, who joined in the assault. One video actually showed policemen allowing these elements to take over from them as they turned their attention to other protesters.\n\nRSS spokesperson Rajeev Tuli, however, dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe uproar over the videos, though, led to the Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi ordering a probe into the allegations. He insisted that he had not seen the videos though most news channels ran them through the day.\n\nStopped from marching towards the RSS headquarters, the 200-odd student activists from JNU, DU, Jamia and a few other varsities broke through the first level of barricades before drawing the police\u2019s wrath.\n\nSome videos circulating on the social media showed students abusing the policemen, the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe students were lathicharged, kicked, pulled by their hair and thrown to the ground by the police. Some female students came forward to claim they were beaten up by policemen as policewomen, very few in numbers, watched.\n\nAmidst all this, political parties led by the AAP, made the most of the incident.\n\nKejriwal condemns police\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal went on to call the Delhi Police the \u201cprivate army\u201d of the BJP and the RSS out to \u201cterrorise\u201d anyone opposing them.\n\nMr. Kejriwal, who is in Bengaluru for his naturopathy treatment, tweeted: \u201cDel pol being used by BJP/RSS as their pvt army to terrorize n teach lesson to anyone opposing BJP/RSS. I strongly condemn attck on students [sic].\u201d",
