    "text": "The Supreme Court pulled up the Gujarat government for not implementing the food security law, saying that the measure \u201cextends to the whole of India.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, tomorrow Bihar can say it will not implement the Criminal Procedure Code and some other States will say they do not believe in the Indian Penal Code or other laws of Parliament. The food security law extends to the whole of India... So, Gujarat thinks it is unique,\u201d said Justice Madan B. Lokur, who was on the Bench with Justice R.K. Agarwal. \u201cWhat is Parliament doing about this? We have absolutely no idea what you are all doing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by Common Cause. The petition dealt with the lack of effective implementation of welfare schemes such as food security, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and basic water supply to the drought-hit States.\n\nSolicitor-General Ranjit Kumar, who appeared for the Centre, said top officials of the drought-hit States met the Union Agriculture Secretary on January 25 and 27 as per the order of the SC to assess the situation. Of the 36 States, 25 were implementing the food security law. Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana had not declared drought, he said.",
