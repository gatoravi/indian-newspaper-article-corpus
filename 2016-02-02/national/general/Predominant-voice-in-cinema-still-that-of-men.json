After 40, women forget they are women. There\u2019s a certain liberation and we get to know ourselves. Everything depends on capability, except maybe when we are abused or put down.\u201d\n\nShe set out to speak on acting at the seminar on Monday, but the interactive session took its own course and the charming actor spoke on everything ranging from working with her husband Mani Ratnam, learning languages, technology in cinema, the culture of remaking movies, to working with today\u2019s young directors.\n\nMs Suhasini elaborated how the predominant voice in cinema was still that of men. \u201cWomen should be able to come out and narrate stories from their point of view.\u201d During the interaction she recalled how her father (actor Charu Hassan) would tell her that women could be given career and economic freedom, but emotional freedom must come from within. \u201cI still haven\u2019t come out of it, or I would have directed 20 films by now, or dedicated myself to community work, or would have joined politics.\u201d Answering another question, Ms. Suhasini said she became an actor because \u201cwe women want to take the easy way out. I appreciate men because they take risks.\u201d\n\nWhen moderator Prakash Belawadi steered the conversation towards the objection to remaking films, Ms Suhasini clearly voted against remakes. \u201cMy husband won\u2019t remake films and won\u2019t allow anyone to remake his films. It\u2019s like making your child study like your neighbour's child.\u201d",
