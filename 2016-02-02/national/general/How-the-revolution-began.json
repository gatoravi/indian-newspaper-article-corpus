Maliyappa took to the chalk and the blackboard and motivated people to take to teaching ever since.\n\nThe late Hallappa\u2019s son, H. Kaleshappa, says that the community traditionally were shepherds (Kurubas).\n\n\u201cAs they watched over their flock of sheep, people sang and narrated stories. Although they did not know to read and write, they would grasp things well in the form of song and poems,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the 1960s, the three persuaded them to take to education. People from the village realised that pursuing education was the only way to climb the social ladder and encouraged others to become teachers.",
