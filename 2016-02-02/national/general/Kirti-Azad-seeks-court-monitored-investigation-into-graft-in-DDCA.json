The petitioners said Justice (retd.) Mukul Mudgal had found several irregularities and indicted the working committee of the DDCA.\n\n\u201cIt is further submitted that the High Court has refused to entertain the plea of the DDCA for temporary permissions, because of which it has lost an opportunity to host a crucial match in the upcoming World T-20 Championship,\u201d the petition said.",
