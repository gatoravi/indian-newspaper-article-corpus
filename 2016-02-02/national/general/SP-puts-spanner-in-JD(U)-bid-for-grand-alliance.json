    "text": "Throwing a spanner in JD-U\u2019s efforts to form a \u2018maha gathbandhan\u2019 in Uttar Pradesh ahead of 2017 Assembly polls, ruling Samajwadi Party on Monday said it would go solo and not become part of any grand alliance.\n\n\u201cParty state president Akhilesh Yadav has already made the party\u2019s stand clear that it will go alone in the 2017 polls and will not become part of any alliance,\u201d SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury told reporters here.\n\nIn Bihar too, SP had walked out of the JD(U)-RJD-Cong. grand alliance and formed a third front to contest the Assembly polls.\n\nApparently attacking JD(U) for trying to forge a grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Chowdhury said those who have never \u201cstruggled\u201d and always remained at the \u201cmercy\u201d of the government have now become \u201cover enthusiastic\u201d due to victory in the \u201cneighbouring state\u201d (Bihar).\n\n\u201cSP already has grand alliance with 22 crore people of the state (U.P.) and they know only this party can fight communal forces and those dabbling in communal politics,\u201d he said. Noting that U.P. was facing challenge from communal forces, Mr Chowdhury said the Chief Minister was effectively dealing with them while propagating his development agenda. - PTI",
