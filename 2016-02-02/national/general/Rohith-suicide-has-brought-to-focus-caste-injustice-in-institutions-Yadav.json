    "text": "The suicide of Rohith Vemula has brought to national attention the issue of how invisibly and deeply inscribed caste injustice is in our modern institutions, activist and former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav said, also attacking the AAP's stand on caste.\n\nAlluding to the controversy over Rohith Vemula\u2019s caste, Mr. Yadav said any claim about caste injustice was now being seen as a bogus claim: \u201cif your certificate happens to be not SC, but OBC or Extremely Backward Caste\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo the government representatives go about presenting the case as if the whole thing hinges on producing an SC certificate or not producing it, which is to say an entire question of caste injustice is reduced to one formal boundary,\u201d Mr. Yadav pointed out while delivering the M.S.S. Pandian Memorial Lecture organised by the Madras Institute of Development Studies and Centre for Studies in Social Transformation.\n\nMr. Yadav also said he was afraid that the standard tactic of \u201cdenial and later, appropriation\u201d of an incident in Indian campuses might escalate into \u201cdenial, appropriation and amnesia as if nothing ever happened\u201d.\n\nTaking on AAP, on its position on caste, he charged that it mirrored the RSS\u2019 stand on the issue. There were two ways to look at caste \u2013 one was to accept it and act on it as an important component of a larger scheme.\n\n\u201cThe second is to completely ignore it. The AAP is trying to completely ignore it, which is not a sustainable strategy in the long term,\u201d he said, adding that the various documents put out by the AAP on caste showed that its stand was \u201cnot much different from the RSS\u201d.\n\nMr. Yadav said there was a clear, decisive shift all over the country in the caste composition of elected representatives.",
