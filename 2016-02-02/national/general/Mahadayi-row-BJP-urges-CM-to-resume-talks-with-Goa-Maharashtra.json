    "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party has blamed the Congress government for the Centre refusing to intervene in the Mahadayi issue. On Monday, the BJP urged Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to resume diplomatic efforts to convince Goa and Maharashtra about the need to initiate negotiations. While Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti has refused to intervene to find an out-of-the-tribunal settlement for the row over sharing of the Mahadayi waters on the grounds that all riparian States had not shown interest in such a proposal, Goa too has declined to take part in negotiations.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Jagadish Shettar, said such a situation would not have happened if Mr. Siddaramaiah had been \u201cdiplomatic\u201d and quick to engage in dialogue with the riparian States in conversation. He said there was still hope of finding a solution if Mr. Siddaramaiah fine-tuned his diplomatic skills and talked to CMs and leaders of the Opposition of Goa and Maharashtra. \u201cIt is not enough if he just shoots off letters to the States requesting an appointment with their Chief Ministers. He must also telephone the Chief Ministers and leaders of the Opposition of these States,\u201d he said. Accusing the Congress of trying to politicise the Mahadayi issue instead of trying to find a solution, Mr. Shettar alleged that the State government had chosen to make public Ms. Uma Bharati\u2019s letter now, ahead of the zilla panchayat elections though it had been written in December.\n\nThis situation would not have risen if CM had been diplomatic, says Jagadish Shettar",
