Chandrababu Naidu, on his part, said that reservation issue would be taken to a logical conclusion by 2017. He said that the government would release a white paper on the entire reservation issue soon.\n\nMeanwhile, the YSR Congress president and the leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at a media conference at Lotus Pond lashed out at Mr. Naidu for trying to cover up his failures by blaming others for the untoward incidents.\n\nHe extended full support to the Kapu community\u2019s demands for inclusion in the BCs without affecting the existing reservations for BCs. Jana Sena founder and film actor Pawan Kalyan asked the government to do justice to Kapus by conceding their long pending demand for inclusion in the Backward Classes without harming the interests of the BCs, at a press conference in Hyderabad.\n\nNational Backward Classes Welfare Association president R. Krishnaian said that the BCs would launch a counter movement to oppose the inclusion of the Kapus in the BCs. He said the association took a serious view of the Kapus resorting to violence in Tuni demanding inclusion in the BCs and any such \u201cblackmail tactics\u201d would be resisted.\n\nA 53-year-old man from Kakinada commits suicide in support of the issue",
