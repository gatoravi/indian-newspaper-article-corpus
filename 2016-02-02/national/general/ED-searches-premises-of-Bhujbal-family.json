We had questioned Pankaj earlier, and we questioned Sameer today. Mr. Bhujbal left for the U.S. on Saturday and was unavailable, but we will question him once he returns,\u201d a senior ED official told The Hindu.\n\nThe searches came hours after his office issued a statement that Mr. Bhujbal had left for Washington, DC, at the invitation of the U.S. Congress. \u201cHe will be participating in a three-day event organised by the U.S. Congress. It will be attended by senior U.S. senators, diplomats, and high-ranking officers of the U.S. judiciary and administration, as well as representatives from 140 countries,\u201d said a statement from Mr. Bhujbal\u2019s office.\n\nThe statement said U.S. President Barack Obama would address the gathering. \u201cDuring the three-day programme, discussions will be held on issues pertaining to social justice, education etc., with focus on mutual co-operation and harmony the world over,\u201d it said.\n\nThe ED had lodged two FIRs against the Bhujbals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with the construction of the new Maharashtra Sadan, and the Kalina land-grab case. The agency also launched proceedings to attach three properties of the Bhujbal family worth over Rs. 280 crore.\n\nBhujbal\u2019s nephew Sameer has been arrested in the money laundering case",
