And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have my picture taken for 10 more years, but not as a model anymore. And that\u2019s okay,\u201d she was quoted as saying by United Airlines\u2019 Rhapsody magazine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve worked with all these incredible photographers. What else do I need to do? I can\u2019t keep reinventing myself. I shouldn\u2019t have to keep proving myself. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she added. \u2014 IANS",
