    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to urgently hear a plea made by the Maharashtra government against a Bombay High Court decision to deny it space to conduct a four-hour event at Mumbai\u2019s Chowpatty beach as part of the Make in India Week to be held from February 13 to 18.\n\nIn an urgent mentioning before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar said the event would have Prime Minister Narendra Modi and five other Prime Ministers and delegates from 56 other countries attending it.\n\nMr. Kumar asked why the beach, used for other events like Ram Lila and Christmas, could not be host to a 1000-sq-metre stage for an international event meant to attract foreign investments.\n\nTo this, Chief Justice Thakur said if the concerns of the High Court had been environmental protection, then the principle that the beach was off-limit applied equally to all.\n\n\u201cMay be the question is of principle. If the beach is tomorrow opened for you, it will have to be opened for all,\u201d Justice Thakur said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kumar said the apprehension had nothing to do with environmental concerns and the High Court had acted on the recommendations of a high-power committee it had set up. He said exemptions had been made in the past to hold events at the beach.\n\nMaharashtra says exemptions had been made earlier to hold such events at the beach",
