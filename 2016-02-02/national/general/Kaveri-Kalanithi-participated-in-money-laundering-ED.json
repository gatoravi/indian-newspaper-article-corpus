Matta, made this submission in reply to a query by the court why the Directorate had made only Kalanidhi Maran and his wife accused in the case when there are other directors in the companies which had allegedly received the proceeds of crime.\n\nMr. Matta also gave to the court the accounts details of the two companies which allegedly received the proceeds of crime. Her signature on different agreements also proved her participation in the crime, Mr. Matta further submitted. Special Judge O.P. Saini was hearing argument by counsel for the Directorate on taking cognisance of the complaint.\n\nThe Directorate had earlier this month filed a complaint against former Union Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother, Kalanithi Maran, and Kaveri Kalanithi in the case. The complaint is a spin-off of the corruption case lodged by CBI in the Aircel-Maxis deal",
