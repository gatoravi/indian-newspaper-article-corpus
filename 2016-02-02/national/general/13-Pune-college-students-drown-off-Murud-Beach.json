All victims were aged between 19 and 23.\n\nAccording to the Raigad district police, all students were from the computer science department of the city-based Abeda Inamdar College. They had gone on a college-sponsored annual picnic near the waters of the historic Murud Janjira fort, said Prashant Burde, Inspector General of Police, Konkan Range.\n\nThe incident occurred between 3 and 3:30 p.m., when the group entered the waters. The police said the students failed to anticipate the sudden low tide and were swept away.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, 115 students accompanied by 11 teachers and staffers set out from Pune at 6.30 in the morning. 13 bodies have been retrieved so far, of which 10 are those of girls. The body of a male student is yet to be found,\u201d said Mr. Burde.\n\nMr. Burde said the five girls, who were traumatised by the incident, were undergoing treatment.\n\n\u201cWe are numbed by this tragedy. We are making all efforts to help the students and their families with the help of the local villagers and police. We are also in touch with the local politicians in the area and they have agreed to deploy resources immediately for the rescue operations,\u201d said P.A. Inamdar, President, Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Education Society.\n\nA massive search operation was mounted to locate the remaining students.\n\nWhile the National Disaster Response Force personnel were pressed into action, the Indian Coast Guard thoroughly combed the area with an interceptor craft, CG 117, and a Chetak Helicopter. A SeaKing vessel, too, has been deployed to aid the search operations.",
