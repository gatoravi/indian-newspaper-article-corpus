Kalluri] gathered in front of my house on Sunday evening. They shouted slogans for about half an hour asking me to leave Bastar. They were trying to brand me a Maoist supporter,\u201d Ms. Subramaniam told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cAround 2.30 a.m. [on Monday], I heard a loud noise. In the morning, we saw large stones lying on the porch and my car was damaged,\u201d she claimed.\n\nNo one was hurt. The glasses of Ms. Subramaniam\u2019s car were smashed.",
