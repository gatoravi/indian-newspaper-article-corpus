It is an after-thought. He was a spy for the drug enforcement agency in the U.S. What is his credibility?\u201d Raja Rizwan Abbasi told The Hindu .\n\nSoon after the 2008 attacks, acting on international pressure, Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency had registered a case against 27 accused, including Lakhvi. He is now out on bail.",
