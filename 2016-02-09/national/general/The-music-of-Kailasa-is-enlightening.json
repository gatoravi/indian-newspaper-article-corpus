The singer says the aim of their music is not just to entertain, but also to enlighten the masses.\n\n\u201cKailasa\u2019s music is not just entertainment, but it is very enlightening also. The music doesn\u2019t entertain, but creates an awakening in the listener. It opens the mind, gives a vision and at the same time, gives fun to the listener,\u201d Kailash said on the sidelines of the SulaFest here.\n\nKailasa, which treads the path of spiritual Indian music while also incorporating western elements, has existed since 2005 and has released four studio albums till date. The band has played live in India and across the globe, thus spreading their sound and vision on a grand scale.\n\nYet, after all these years of creating and performing music, Kailash says the band always assesses the crowd at their concerts, as he doesn\u2019t want to sound too preachy.\n\n\u201cWe decide our repertoire because we have a limited set of time. So among us, we decide what kind of crowd it is. We think that there are so many songs by Kailasa which cater to different moods,\u201d Kailash said.\n\nFor most performers, especially Kailash, having an intimate connection with the crowd is pertinent. However, sometimes it is also important to not go overboard with the message, he says.\n\n\u201cThe relation between audience and performer is very intimate. It is a love-based relationship. You know the vibe... how you will impress your lover. You need to feel the love, so in that case, you need to decide the repertoire,\u201d the 42-year-old said.\n\n\u201cAlong with fun, our music also teaches. So, we have to think before delivering this kind of music to a particular audience. We have to assess the crowd at each concert and think how much of our message do we need to deliver,\u201d Kailash said. \u2014 IANS",
