    "text": "Even as the protests on the University of Hyderabad (UoH) campus entered the 21st day after the suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula, a group of students at the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) have gone on a strike demanding that the administration roll back the suspension of stipend and expulsion from hostels and messes. The EFLU students have been sleeping in the open on their campus demanding that the administration give them their democratic space.\n\nThe university had varyingly penalised 11 students by expelling them from hostels, messes or presence on campus in October 2015 for being part of a protest. The administration had also stopped fellowships of four protesters. The protest called on Sunday night by the students union demanded that the university roll back the decision and pay compensation to those penalised for three months in a row.\n\nAbout 300 students staged a protest in October demanding their right to conduct student union elections. According to the show-cause notice issued by the administration, the students were accused of \u201cleading an unruly mob\u201d.\n\nEven as the administration decided to waive the remaining penalty, the students decided to continue with the sleep-out protest demanding the complete revocation of the decision. \u201cIf the administration waives the penalty instead of revoking the expulsion, EFLU rules would prevent the students from reapplying for courses, jobs or even contesting in student union elections,\u201d said Tony Sebastian, president of the students union.",
