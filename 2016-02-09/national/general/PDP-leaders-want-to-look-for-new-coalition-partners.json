While some have speculated that she might go ahead with the ally BJP, and form a government, others say Ms.Mufti might call off the political partnership, paving the way for new elections after three months of Governor\u2019s rule.\n\nBut PDP sources said the party was not ready to contest elections as it fears a defeat. And a new demand \u2014 of finding new partners other than the BJP that have \u201csecular\u201d credentials \u2014 is gaining momentum within the party fold.\n\nThe significant development took place on January 18, when the PDP leaders met for the first time after Sayeed\u2019s death. Sources privy to the meeting said that the majority of senior party leaders advocated giving the BJP another chance and reinstating the alliance.\n\nTariq Hameed Karra, MP and a founding member of the PDP, later met Ms.Mufti at her residence and advocated a different strategy. Mr.Karra argued that if political foes such as the RJD, JDU and Congress could come together in Bihar, the PDP, NC and Congress could do the same in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAccording to PDP sources, Ms.Mufti asked Mr.Karra if he was aware of the political risks involved in working out such an alliance where the people of Jammu, majority of whom chose the BJP over the Congress, may feel alienated. \u201cTo that, Karra Sahib said the Congress has some councillors in Jammu who could be brought into the government with important portfolios,\u201d he said.",
