    "text": "Rihanna\u2019s long-awaited album Anti hit number one on Sunday on the US chart after an unusual roll-out that included two commercial tie-ups.\n\nAnti , the first album since 2012 by the Barbados-born superstar, which was released on January 27 after apparent delays, topped the Billboard chart for the week through Thursday.\n\nThe album came out initially as an exclusive on Tidal, the streaming service led by rap mogul Jay Z, in a surprise timing on a Wednesday evening US time that defied the music industry\u2019s guideline of global releases on Friday.\n\nElectronics giant Samsung also let one million of its smartphone users download Anti for free. The arrangement likely cut into Rihanna\u2019s sales figures as tracking service Nielsen SoundScan does not count giveaways on the chart.\n\nRihanna signed a promotion deal reportedly worth $25 million with Samsung, which set up an interactive website for the album. \u2014 AFP",
