    "text": "The leopard that had kept 50 Forest Department officials on their toes for the better part of Sunday was missing a tooth and had a bad eye.\n\nThis could explain the fewer injuries suffered by the officials.\n\nThe leopard became the focus of attention after entering a school in Marathahalli.\n\nAfter a visit to the Bannerghatta Biological Park rescue centre, Ravi Ralph, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said the animal did not have an upper left canine and showed signs of glaucoma (cloudiness impairing vision) in its left eye.\n\n\u201cBecause it didn\u2019t have a canine, it couldn\u2019t clutch Sanjay Gubbi (conservationist who was attacked),\u201d said Mr. Ralph.\n\nForest officials and activists praised Mr. Gubbi\u2019s presence of mind, which perhaps prevented far more grievous injuries.\n\nAn official said Mr. Gubbi did not fight back or panic, which explains why the leopard did not go after the jugular.",
