    "text": "The explosion of a red double decker bus in central London on Sunday alarmed witnesses unaware that it was actually a stunt for a Jackie Chan action film.\n\nThe bus was travelling across Lambeth Bridge not far from Britain\u2019s parliament when its top deck exploded with a large bang in a ball of flames. One witness was the author Sophie Kinsella who said children in a park nearby had been \u201cfreaked\u201d by the sight. \u201cI was freaked too. Looked very real,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn fact it was a controlled explosion for the action film The Foreigner , starring actors Mr. Chan and Pierce Brosnan, which is due out later this year.\n\nBut for some it was all too reminiscent of the 7/7 attacks that killed dozens of people in London in 2005. One of those attacks targeted travellers on a red double decker bus.\n\nJohn Taylor, whose 24-year-old daughter Carrie was killed in the 7/7 attacks, asked whether the stunt had been properly \u201cthought through.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can totally understand why some people would be alarmed seeing this today,\u201d Mr. Taylor told the Daily Mirror newspaper\u2019s online edition. \u201cThis seems particularly insensitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bridge had been closed and the film producers had issued warnings of a controlled explosion to local residents and businesses before it was carried out.\n\nAuthorities, however, sought to reassure people afterwards.\n\n\u201cIf you saw this on Lambeth bridge this morning don\u2019t worry it was for a film & not a real incident,\u201d wrote London Fire Brigade on Twitter. \u2014 AFP",
