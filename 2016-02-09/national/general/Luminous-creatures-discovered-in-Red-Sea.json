    "text": "An international team of biologists has discovered a new species of luminous fauna in the Red Sea.\n\nThe research also showed that the localisation of glow in certain parts of the body can help to distinguish different species of organisms that have identical structure.\n\nDuring the investigations of the biodiversity of coral reefs of the archipelago Farasan (Saudi Arabia, south of the Red Sea), biologists found what they have termed \u201cfluorescent lanterns\u201d that were very similar to hydrae.\n\nBut unlike their distant relatives who lead a solitary life in fresh water, the new species from the Red Sea form spreading colonies, decorating miniature shells of a sea snail with garlands of green lights. \u201cSea hydroids, unlike hydrae, are often found in colonies and can branch off tiny jellyfish,\u201d said one of the study authors Vyacheslav Ivanenko from Moscow State University in Russia.\n\n\u201cThe unusual green glow of these hydrozoas (presumably, a new species of the genus Cytaeis ) was revealed in the peristomal area of the body,\u201d Mr. Ivanenko noted.\n\nThe researchers suggested that glow around the mouth of polyps may attract prey.\n\nThe results of the study were published in the journal PLOS ONE . \u2014 IANS",
