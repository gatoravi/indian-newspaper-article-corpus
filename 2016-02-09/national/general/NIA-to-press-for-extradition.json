He is still an accused for us and we will continue to press the U.S authorities for his extradition. Our case against him and Tahawwur Rana still hold ground. Till now, we have no intention of making him an approver,\u201d an NIA officer said.\n\nHe said that if at all this possibility of Headley being turned into an approver was explored in future by the NIA, it would be done so by the prosecutors and not by the investigating agency. \u201cThere are so many aspects to the conspiracy and their implications, which have not been explored yet. We need Headley\u2019s custodial interrogation to unearth the entire terrorist module,\u201d he said.\n\nAn NIA charge sheet filed in 2011 said Headley did not stop at conducting reconnaissance and planning the 2008 attack, but was also involved in the \u201cexecution of other future planned attacks [on various Chabad Houses and the National Defence College, Delhi] at the behest of LeT and HuJI.\u201d\n\nHeadley travelled to India again in March 2009 to conduct recce for the attacks, before being arrested at O\u2019Hare Airport, Chicago, in October that year. Headley has been sentenced to 35 years in prison by a U.S. court.\n\nOur stand is\n\nclear. Headley is still an accused\n\nfor us, says\n\nNIA officer",
