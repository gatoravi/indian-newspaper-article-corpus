    "text": "Four devotees, including a temple volunteer, drowned in the tank of Sri Arunachaleswarar Temple here following a stampede on Monday.\n\nThe devotees were taking a dip at the Ayyankula Theertham as part of the \u2018mahodaya punyakala theerthavaari\u2019 (a ritual as part of which the processional deity \u2014 utsava murthi \u2014 is taken for a dip) that comes once in several years.\n\nA handful of police personnel present at the spot could do nothing as the crowd surged ahead desperately, resulting in a stampede. While the priests were rescued instantly another devotee called Punyakoti(52) of Durabali Street here, was also rescued but he died after some time. There were no safety arrangements like hand railings or life jackets in the pond. Fire and rescue services personnel said the temple administration had not sought assistance.\n\nThe dead were identified as Manikandan (32), an engineering college lecturer Siva (30), an IT professional, Venkataraman (30) and Punyakoti (52) of Ammani Amman Kupuram Street here.",
