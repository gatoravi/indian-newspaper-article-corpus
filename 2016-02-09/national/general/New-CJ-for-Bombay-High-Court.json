    "text": "The government on Monday announced the transfer of the Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court, Dhirendra Hiralal Waghela, to the Bombay High Court to assume office as Chief Justice from February 16.\n\nThe Supreme Court Collegium led by the Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur had recommended Mr. Waghela\u2019s transfer last month and the President had approved it.\n\nBorn in 1954 at Rajkot, Chief Justice Waghela, according to a short biography published on the Orissa High Court\u2019s website, was perceived as a precocious child by his teachers. He excelled in academics, so much so that he cleared his law exams at a very young age and had to wait a few months to be enrolled with the Bar.\n\nHe initially practised in the Labour and Industrial courts and even represented the Labour Bar of Saurashtra in the agitation for a High Court bench in Saurashtra. He later shifted his practice to the High Court in 1990.\n\nNine years later, he was called to the Bench and he assumed office as an Additional Judge of the High Court of Gujarat in September, 1999.\n\nChief Justice Waghela was elevated as Chief Justice, High Court of Karnataka, in March 2013. In June 2015, he took oath as the Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court.",
