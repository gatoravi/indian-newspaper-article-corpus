There were no safety arrangements like hand railings or life jackets in the pond.\n\nHindu Munnani District President Shankar condemned the temple administration for lack of arrangements and lack of police protection.\n\nFire and rescue services personnel said the temple administration had not sought assistance . Hence, they were called in only after the mishap incident took place. The dead were identified as Manikandan (32), Siva (30), Venkataraman (30) and Punyakoti (52).",
