They were presented before a magistrate, who remanded them in judicial custody for seven days. The JLKF planned to take out a protest march on the two days.\n\nSources said banners and posters depicting Bhat, who was hanged in 1984, and Guru, executed in 2013, have been printed in large numbers by the separatist groups.\n\n\u201cThe last letter of Guru, written before he went to the gallows, has become a source of inspiration. His hanging amounted to a murder of justice and proved that India\u2019s democratic claims were a fraud,\u201d said Ayaz Akbar, spokesman of Syed Ali Geelani, leader of a Hurriyat faction.\n\nBoth Mr. Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who heads another faction of the Hurriyat, have issued calls for a shutdown and demanded the return of the mortal remains of Guru and Bhat from Tihar Jail in Delhi.\n\nSources said security would be intensified in sensitive areas.",
