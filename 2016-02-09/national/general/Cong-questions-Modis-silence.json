Since the land had been allotted from one of the parcels close to the sanctuary, Mr. Tewari said the ensuing development could prove disastrous for the ecologically fragile area, home to the endangered Asiatic Lions.\n\n\u201cThe question that arises is who is this customisation of policy benefiting? Who will benefit from the flagrant violation of environment law and wildlife protection law?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe silence of the Prime Minister and Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel is deafening,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a clear case of impropriety, corruption and conflict of interest, says Tewari",
