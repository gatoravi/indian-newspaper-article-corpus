    "text": "After seeking 19 cuts in the Marathi play Jai Bhim Jai Bharat and denying a clearance certificate to it, the Maharashtra government\u2019s censor board for theatre relented on Monday after watching the play on Sunday night.\n\nOn Monday, board chairman Arun Nalawade told The Hindu that considering the play was largely experimental, the committee decided to grant the censor certificate to it.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the board, the members along with Mr. Nalawade watched the first show of the play without any cut to decide on granting the certificate.\n\n\u201cWe watched it only to judge people\u2019s reaction and whether they will find it objectionable. Following the show, we held a meeting and decided to grant the certificate. I put my weight behind the playwright to ensure it gets cleared,\u201d he said.\n\nThe board had suggested 19 cuts in the play\u2019s script. It had asked playwright Jandardan Jadhav to change Khairlanji to Vairanjli, Kutra (dog) to shwan, Mahar (a caste) to Dalit, Ramabai Nagar to Mirabai Nagar, Hindutva vadi to those with power etc. In 1997, 11 Dalits were shot by the police in Mumbai\u2019s Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar at Ghatkopar. In 2006, four members of a Dalit family were killed by upper caste villagers in Vidarbha\u2019s Khairlanji village. Both incidents had led to an uproar in the State as well as in the country. The board had said that mentioning these names would hurt the sentiments of people.\n\nThe play revolves around a fictional conversation between Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the play has been cleared. However, we are yet to receive a copy of the board\u2019s letter,\u201d said Subodh More, who is organising the play.",
