The handful of police personnel at the spot could do nothing to prevent them. The crowd barged into the pond, and in the melee some fell down and the crowd trampled them.\n\nThe priests were rescued. A devotee who was also rescued died later.\n\nSources in the fire and rescue services said the temple administration had not asked for assistance as a precautionary measure.",
