    "text": "Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel has conveyed to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley his concern over withdrawal of customs duty exemption on 74 medicines.\n\nThe withdrawal of exemption came last week, following a notice by the Central Board of Excise and Customs. This will result in a rise in the prices of the drugs.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely worrisome decision and is in complete conflict with the larger public,\u201d Mr. Patel said in a letter to the Finance Minister. \u201cWhy were these select medicines targeted and what were the prior consultations to arrive at this list?\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that a vast number of these medicines come under the National Essential Medicines List, 2015, why has the government allowed their prices to rise,\u201d Mr. Patel asked.\n\n\u201cMost of these medicines are the only link between life and death, especially for patients of cancer and haemophilia, many of them who live in underdeveloped tribal regions and need doses of anti-haemophilic factor concentrates on a regular basis,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCalling the government\u2019s move \u201cconfounding\u201d despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing it last November, the letter stated that the changes in the duty would \u201cimpose an additional burden\u201d on the patients who come from poor backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWhile I completely endorse the broader aim of boosting local production of medicines, this endeavour cannot be undertaken at the cost of compromising access to affordable healthcare in the present,\u201d Mr. Patel said.",
