    "text": "With the government coming under criticism from the Opposition in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday for its handling of the Pathankot operation, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said \u201csmall incidents of terrorism have to be treated as war.\u201d Home Minister Rajnath Singh said India wanted good relations with Pakistan but not at the cost of its \u201cpride, dignity and self-respect.\u201d\n\nMr. Parrikar said the route the attackers took to the Pathankot airbase had not been traced yet, but insisted that six terrorists were involved in the attack. The National Investigation Agency had said only four bodies were found.\n\nThe Minister said the operation lasted 43 hours and \u201cthe remaining two terrorists\u201d could not be caught alive as \u201cthey were hiding in the concrete cupboards\u201d at the Airmen Billet, which was blown up. Mr. Singh said it was established that the two were terrorists as the \u201ccharred remains\u201d collected from the building and sent for forensic examination revealed that the \u201cburnt mass material belonged to human male.\u201d\n\nMr. Parrikar and Mr. Singh were responding to a debate during which the Opposition dubbed as a \u201ccritical mistake\u201d the decision to hand over the operation to the National Security Guard.\n\nThe Opposition asked what Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Lahore stopover had achieved, noting that the terror strike had happened just a few days after that.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand that Pathankot attack is an accumulation of asymmetric war. We should realise that this is an attempt wherein the opposition forces never expected to win but want to create a sort of discord amongst our political leadership and amongst other leadership, including the military leadership so that moral strength of the military leadership gets weakened,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said.\n\nTechnical Services Division\n\nHe said the Technical Services Division (TSD) set up by the then Army Chief, General V.K. Singh, \u201cfell to the political aspirations, to the political policies and political scoring point.\u201d The TSD was a secret unit and it was scrapped soon after Mr. Singh\u2019s retirement. There were allegations that the then UPA government was in the dark about its functioning and there were alleged misuse of funds.",
