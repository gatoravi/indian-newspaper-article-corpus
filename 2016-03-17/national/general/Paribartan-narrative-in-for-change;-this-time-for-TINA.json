    "text": "West Bengal is yet to work itself into a frenzy over the Assembly elections that begin in April, but many in the State capital here already consider it a foregone conclusion that the Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, will retain power in the State.\n\nMs. Banerjee, who rode to power in 2011 on the plank of Paribartan , or change, ending 34 years of Left rule in West Bengal, has not turned out to be the most popular of its chief ministers. From being criticised for insensitive statements to earning flak for a collapsed Ponzi scheme and being accused of patronising political violence, she has always made headlines for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to find the lay voter predicting her return, sometimes matter-of-factly and sometimes grudgingly. Those supporting her say she will win because of the good work she has done during her tenure, while those opposing her think she might sail through because of the lack of a robust challenge.\n\nThe Left Front, still nursing the wounds it received in 2011, has, for the first time in the State, joined hands with its one-time bitter foe, the Congress, in a bid to dislodge Ms. Banerjee.\n\n\u201cI am a Lal Jhanda [red flag] man, but I can see people voting for her simply because there is no one else to vote for,\u201d Jatin Pal, a taxi driver, said sagaciously as he drove me from Salt Lake City to College Street. \u201cThere is no visible leader from the Opposition who can take her on. But why are you asking me about elections? Are you from the intelligence department?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d I replied, \u201cI just want to get an idea of the public mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you want discussion,\u201d he was relieved. \u201cDiscussion is always welcome.\u201d\n\nOn College Street, bookseller Amiya Ghosh was more busy obliging passers-by who asked for directions than attending to customers, but he found time for a discussion with me.\n\n\u201cAll said and done,\u201d said Mr. Ghosh, \u201cMamata di has done some good work. The roads are much better now, there are more buses. You hardly see any garbage lying around. And ever since she came to power, there have hardly been any bandhs \u2014 that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because she was the one who frequently called for bandhs when she was in Opposition,\u201d I reminded him.\n\n\u201cTrue, so what prevented the Left Front from calling for bandhs in these five years? They didn\u2019t do it because they could not find any fault with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a Trinamool supporter?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that matter,\u201d Mr. Ghosh retorted. \u201cI am only telling you the truth.\u201d\n\nUnlike him, Kunal Saha, who sold wristlets on the pavement in Dharmatala, turned out to be a self-confessed Mamata Banerjee supporter. \u201cShe may not win with the same margin, but she will win. She will complete 15 years in power, mark my words,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat has she done for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis stall is my only source of living, and I have six people to feed. During the Left Front rule, I would be thrown out of here every now and then. But for the past five years, no one has touched me. Every week I go to the police station and pay a fine of 60 rupees, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nA stone\u2019s throw from the bustle of the pavement, in the plush offices of a corporate giant on Chowringhee Road, sat Kaushik Roy, a finance superintendent with the company, who told me that while he was ideologically opposed to the Trinamool Congress and would never vote for it, he would not deny that there has been development in Kolkata during its rule.\n\n\u201cThe development may have been incremental, but there has been development. One remarkable change brought about by this government is garbage disposal. Earlier you saw heaps of garbage all over the city, dogs foraging on them. Now they use compactors, which has made all the difference,\u201d Mr. Roy said.\n\n\u201cAnd in February last year,\u201d he said, \u201cI was down with flu. So I went to the Beleghata ID hospital to get myself tested, I found it difficult to believe it was a government hospital, so clean it was.\u201d\n\nMany in Kolkata say Trinamool may benefit from the \u2018there is no alternative\u2019 factor",
