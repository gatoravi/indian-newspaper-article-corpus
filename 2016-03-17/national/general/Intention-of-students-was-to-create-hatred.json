    "text": "The public prosecutor, who opposed the bail plea of JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya at the sessions court here on Wednesday, said the case against JNU students union leader Kanhaiya Kumar was different from that against the applicants. Mr. Kumar was not the organiser of the progra-mme commemorating the hanging of Afzal Guru at the varsity campus on February 9.\n\nThe public prosecutor also contended that the intention of the two students, now in judicial custody, was to \u201ccreate hatred\u201d against the established government, which attracted sedition charges.\n\nReferred to Chief Justice\n\nMeanwhile, the Delhi High Court\u2019s Bench of Justice Pratibha Rani on Wednesday referred a batch of petitions seeking cancellation of the interim bail granted to Mr. Kumar to the Chief Justice for allocating them before another Bench for hearing.\n\nThe judge passed the order after counsel for one of the petitioners took exception to the court\u2019s warning that it could impose a cost on them along with the dismissal of petitions.",
