It was suggested that \u201cnational security\u201d be replaced with \u201cpublic emergency\u201d or in the interests of \u201cpublic safety.\u201d\n\nAnother amendment related to permitting individuals with Aadhaar numbers to opt out of the system, with the Central Identities Data Repository deleting all information and authentication records, and giving a certificate to that effect within 15 days.\n\nA third amendment provided for alternative identification for delivery of services, subsidies and benefits to those choosing not to enrol for an Aadhaar number.\n\nA fourth amendment mandated the inclusion of the Central Vigilance Commissioner or the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the Oversight Committee. The fifth amendment sought the deletion of a clause that allows the Aadhaar number to be used for purposes other than those provided in the Bill.\n\nThe government\u2019s contention is that the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, would provide for good governance and efficient, transparent, and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services. The Opposition wanted the legislation to have safeguards to avoid sensitive private information of the individual from being disclosed or accessed \u201con the whim of the Executive.\u201d\n\nCongress leader Jairam Ramesh, the star speaker in the Rajya Sabha, said: \u201cWe are knocking a nail into the coffin of the Upper House. I am sure Lord Krishna had Opposition members of the Rajya Sabha in mind when he advised Arjuna: karmanye vaadhikaraste ma faleshu kadachana (one must do their duty regardless of the outcome).\u201d\n\n\u201cI am questioning the competence of this House to legislate the Bill,\u201d Sitaram Yechury of the CPI(M) said, arguing that the Bill was also being considered by the Supreme Court and was beyond \u201cthe legislative authority\u201d of the House. To this accusation, Mr. Jaitley responded: \u201cThis is an unprecedented argument in a democracy which has the separation of powers. The court only has power of judicial review.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the principal purpose is money spent out of the Consolidated Fund of India in a particular manner and a machinery is created for spending that money, it is a Money Bill,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said, in reply to the Opposition\u2019s objections to the legislation being framed as a Money Bill.",
