    "text": "The Bombay High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition seeking public apology from Amrita Fadnavis, wife of Maharashtra Chief Minister, for accepting a necklace from a godman and being \u201cinvolved in black magic.\u201d\n\nQuoting an incident on February 9, a criminal public interest litigation (PIL) plea was filed by Dalit activist and social worker Anil Kokane. He said Ms. Fadnavis accepted a necklace from godman Guruvanand Swamy who materialised it from air using \u2018tantric vidya\u2019. The PIL also states that the godman claims to have been educated at Banaras Hindu University and IIT, Kharagpur, and that he is a self-proclaimed god. It sought the verification of his qualifications.\n\nAdditional government pleader Hiten Venegavkar questioned the maintainability of the petition and said no private complaint or FIR was made against the godman and that the petitioner had approached the court directly.\n\nA Division Bench of Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice M.S. Sonak told the petitioner to draw up a list of the social work he had done, and asked what his contribution to society was. The court also asked for the petitioner\u2019s locus standi in the case \u2014 how he was eligible to take up social and public causes.\n\nThe court wanted to know if the PIL fit into the guidelines issued by the HC registry and asked if he had approached the authorities and made an appropriate representation.\n\nThe advocate appearing for the petitioner then sought permission from the court to withdraw his petition. The Bench recorded that the PIL cannot be entertained, told him to make appropriate representation to the authorities, and dismissed the petition.",
