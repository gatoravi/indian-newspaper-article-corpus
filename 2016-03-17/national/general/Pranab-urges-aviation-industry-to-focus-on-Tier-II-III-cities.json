India is one of the least penetrated air-markets in the world with 0.04 trips per capita per annum as compared to 0.3 of China and over 2 in the U.S.\n\nNoting that the middle-class would propel the growth, in the backdrop of rising income levels, he said development of tourism and trade were other contributing factors for the increase in passenger traffic.\n\n\u201cIt is time the government and the stakeholders leveraged this tremendous business opportunity,\u201d Mr. Mukherjee said, adding India would require at least 800 aircraft by 2020 to cater to the phenomenal increase of passenger and freight traffic.\n\nSupporting infrastructure, he said, it has to be suitably upgraded by building new Greenfield airports, expanding the existing airports and upgrading facilities for maintenance, repair and operations.\n\nUrging participants to draw an action plan to make India a hub for manufacturing, Mr. Mukherjee said the \u2018Make In India\u2019 initiative aimed to facilitate investment, foster innovation, protect intellectual property and build world-class manufacturing infrastructure.",
