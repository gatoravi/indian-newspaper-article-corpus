A meeting has been called by the Chief Proctor for Friday, the same day the students are supposed to send their replies.\n\nAfter a high-level five-member committee of the university found them guilty of \u201cviolating university norms and discipline rules\u201d, the notices were issued on March 14. They were asked to explain why disciplinary action should not be initiated against them.\n\nThe students who have been served the notice include JNU Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, Anirban Bhattacharya, Umar Khalid, Rama Naga, Ashutosh Kumar, Anant Prakash, Shweta Raj, Aishwarya Adhikari and Chintu Kumari.\n\nUmar and Anirban, who are in judicial custody on sedition charges, have been served notice that lists four charges against them: \u201cfurnishing false information to the university\u201d, \u201carousing communal, caste or religion feeling\u201d, \u201ccausing unauthorised entry in the campus\u201d and \u201cany other point that may be considered violation by the Vice-Chancellor.\u201d The notice served on Ashutosh lists the same charges, except that of furnishing false information.\n\nThe notice served on others lists a single charge: \u201cAny other act which may be considered by the Vice-Chancellor or any other authority to be an act of violation of discipline.\u201d\n\nWhile no specific charges have been made against Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar, who is facing sedition charges, the university has found ABVP member and JNUSU joint secretary Saurabh Sharma \u201cguilty\u201d of blocking traffic on February 9.\n\nThe panel report submitted on March 11 pointed to lapses on the part of the students as well as the administration. On the same day, academic suspension of eight students, including Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar, was revoked.\n\nMeanwhile, the students who had refused to depose before the committee called a council meeting on Wednesday night to discuss whether or not to reply to the notice. A decision could not be reached at an all-party meeting organised on the campus which went on till late on Tuesday night.\n\nThe probe panel is believed to have recommended rustication of Umar and Anirban and a fine on other students.\n\nThe committee report is based completely on eyewitness accounts and document trails, since none of the eight debarred students, deposed. The committee, which was constituted on February 11, had on February 12 debarred the eight students for their involvement in the February 9 incident and had issued notices to them to depose before the committee. However, none of the students deposed, citing issues with the composition of the panel.",
