The girl is said to be the step-daughter of a provision store owner.\n\nIn a similar incident in July 2015, Pandey had hit the headlines when a video showing him forcing a woman inmate to have sex with him had gone viral.\n\nThe video was reportedly shot by some prisoners who had also alleged that Mr. Pandey used to indulge in even unnatural sex with jail inmates. Pandey, though, had denied the charges at that time and no action was taken against him.\n\nFootage of Kripa Shankar Pandey touching her inappropriately\n\nhas gone viral",
