But when I was informed that your decision had emanated from public opinion and public sentiment, I was comforted,\u201d Mr. Modi said in a statement to the museum.\n\n\u201cDuring my sitting, I observed the team carefully and was deeply impressed by its dedication, professionalism and skill. I have visited Madame Tussauds three or four times and had the pleasure of getting myself photographed standing next to the figures of various dignitaries,\u201d he added.\n\nThe wax figures at each of the museum\u2019s locations around Europe and Asia will be dressed in Modi\u2019s signature kurta-pyjama along with a jacket and he will be featured in a traditional pose \u201cmaking a namaste gesture\u201d.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Modi is a hugely important figure in world politics, a position supported by his place in the top 10 of Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year List 2015,\u201d said museum spokesperson Kieran Lancini.\n\n\u201cHis massive social media presence \u2014 he is currently the second most followed politician on Twitter after U.S. President Obama \u2014 also confirms the intense interest the public have in him, a fact supported by the requests our guests have made for us to create his figure. \u201cWe are delighted to be including the Prime Minister\u2019s figure in our attractions in London, Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok,\u201d Mr. Lancini said.\n\nEach figure took a team of Madame Tussauds\u2019 artists four months and cost around \u00a3150,000 (Rs. 1.42 crore) to create.\n\n\u201cGuests will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder and measure up to one of the most powerful men in the world \u2014 and even grab a selfie when the figures arrive in their locations,\u201d the museum said.\n\nThe launch in London and all other centres is expected in April.\n\nA new branch of Madame Tussauds is also set to open in New Delhi as part of the India\u2013U.K. Year of Culture in 2017, as announced during Prime Minister Modi\u2019s visit to the U.K. last November. \u2014 PTI",
