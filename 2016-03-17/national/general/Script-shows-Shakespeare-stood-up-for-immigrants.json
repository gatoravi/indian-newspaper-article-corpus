    "text": "The only surviving play script including William Shakespeare's handwriting, and also containing a passionate speech against xenophobia, is being put online to mark the 400th anniversary of the bard\u2019s death, the British Library announced Tuesday.\n\nThe script is a section from a controversial play that revolves around how statesman Sir Thomas More quelled a 1517 anti-foreigner uprising in London by asking the rioters to imagine themselves being banished to live abroad.\n\nThe 164-line scene has been attributed to Shakespeare, one of several writers brought in to rework The Book Of Sir Thomas More .\n\nIn challenging rioters, More says: Alas, alas! Say now the King/ As he is clement if th'offender mourn,/ Should so much come too short of your great trespass/ As but to banish you: whither would you go?/What country, by the nature of your error,/ Should give you harbour?\n\n\u201cGo you to France or Flanders,/ To any German province, Spain or Portugal,/ Nay, anywhere that not adheres to England:/ Why, you must needs be strangers.\u201d\n\nThe play was originally written by Anthony Munday between 1596 and 1601, but other writers were later brought in to revise the script.\n\nOne of the six hands involved has been identified as Shakespeare's, based on handwriting, spelling, vocabulary and the images and ideas expressed. The manuscript will be available at www.bl.uk/shakespeare and will also be on display at the British Library. \u2014 AFP\n\nHandwritten play surviving to this day will be posted on www.bl.uk/shakespeare",
