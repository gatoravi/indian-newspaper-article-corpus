The strike has hit them hardest as many of them are daily wage-earners.\n\n\u201cThe association has organised food packets to help workers in view of the strike,\u201d said Mr. Ranka.\n\nThe Excise Department\u2019s efforts to allay the fears of the jewellers, with directives stating that only those with an annual turnover of Rs 12 crore would come under the ambit of the levy, have failed to cut any ice with them.\n\n\u201cWe are going to join our counterparts in our business fraternity to protest against the Central government\u2019s decision in Delhi on Thursday,\u201d said Sourabh Gadgil of PNG Jewellers.",
