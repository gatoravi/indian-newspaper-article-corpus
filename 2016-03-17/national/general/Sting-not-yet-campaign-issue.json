    "text": "While the Trinamool Congress is under severe pressure after a sting-video showed its leaders allegedly taking bribes, it was expected that the alliance of the Left and the Congress would make it a key election issue. However, both parties are yet to launch any massive campaign against the Trinamool.\n\nMoreover, Left Front chairperson Biman Bose said on Wednesday that the Front partners were disturbed over a comment made by the Pradesh Congress Committee president, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, about the constituents of the Left Front.\n\n\u201cThe Left Front has evolved through many struggles and it has its history. But the PCC president has said something about the Front constituents, which is humiliating,\u201d Mr. Bose said. Earlier, Mr. Chowdhury said that while the Congress \u201cis having a good dialogue with the CPI(M), the action of the Front\u2019s partners are creating problems.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing another small list of candidates, Mr. Bose said the Left still had differences with the Congress \u201cin a few seats\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe differences will be addressed and a final list will be produced.\u201d\n\nMr. Bose demanded a probe by the Election Commission into the sting-video. \u201cThe EC should look into the matter. If the footages are fake, then action should be initiated against the producers of the video and if it is not, then action should be taken against the politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Left Front will take out a rally in Kolkata on Thursday to demand a probe into the sting-scam.\n\n\u201cSuch protest programmes will be initiated across the State,\u201d Mr. Bose said.",
