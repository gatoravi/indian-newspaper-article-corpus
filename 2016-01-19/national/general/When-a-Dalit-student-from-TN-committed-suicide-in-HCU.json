    "text": "The suicide of Rohith Vemula at the Hyderabad Central University (HCU) on Sunday has rocked the nation and has yet again brought to focus the discrimination Dalits face on campus. In this, the HCU and its science departments have a history given that it claimed the life of a research scholar from Tamil Nadu a few years ago.\n\nIn early 2008, the body of Senthil Kumar, who hailed from Jalakandadapuram in Salem, was found in the hostel. The post-mortem report of the body established that cause of death as poisoning and this led to serious questions about the death itself.\n\nIt was in such a circumstance that a faculty member of the university contacted D. Ravikumar, general secretary of VCK who was then an MLA.\n\nThe details that emerged painted a tragic picture of how the spirited life of a Dalit student from an impoverished family was put out by the discrimination the prevailed on campus. Senthil Kumar hailed from a small sub-caste of the Dalits named \u2018Panniyandi\u2019, known for pig rearing. He was perhaps the first person to pursue a doctorate from the community and was seen as a hero in Jalakandapuram.\n\n\u201cThe family lived in two small sheds. They took one and the other had the pigs. It was an amazing achievement for someone from such an economically weaker class to fight all odds and pursue a doctorate in science,\u201d said Mr. Ravikumar. After his Masters in the American College in Madurai, Senthil pursued his M.Phil at the Pondicherry University before moving to HCU for a doctorate in Physics.",
