    "text": "The Hunger Games star is trying edgier gowns and developing a style that is all her own\n\nJennifer Lawrence hit the red carpet in a scarlet Dior dress, at the Golden Globes in Los Angele earlier this month.\u2014 Photo: NYT\n\nWhen she\u2019s not jet-skiing with Amy Schumer, or taking on equal pay in Hollywood, Jennifer Lawrence, a self-professed workaholic, is likely to be found on the red carpet swathed in Dior.\n\nLawrence, 25, was just nominated for an Oscar for her role in Joy and was in contention for her roles in that movie and in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards on Sunday. She was signed to a lucrative deal by the French luxury brand in 2012 and has, to some red carpet commentators\u2019 lament, been a proper mannequin since.\n\nBut a style seems to be slowly emerging. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely coming into her own; you can see that with her starting to talk about politics in interviews and discussing things that mean something to her personally,\u201d said Hillary Kerr, a founder of the website WhoWhatWear.com .\n\n\u201cThat all comes together, too, in style, because it\u2019s part of owning who you are and realising that the way you dress communicates something about you,\u201d she said.\n\nMore daring\n\nWorking with her long-time stylists Jill Lincoln and Jordan Johnson, prot\u00e9g\u00e9es of Rachel Zoe who struck out on their own in March and took a plum roster of celebrities with them, Ms. Lawrence, who was born in Louisville, Kentucky, has been more daring in the past year. (Lincoln and Johnson declined to comment.) Gone are the fairy-tale gowns that might double as bedsheets. Rather, \u201cshe experiments; she\u2019s never boring,\u201d Ms. Kerr said.\n\nThough Lawrence prefers plunging necklines, such as a sweet long slip dress by Dior in the palest yellow that she wore to the Joy New York premiere in December, and a ruffled black Ralph Lauren gown she donned for the The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 premiere in Madrid, she occasionally tries a more demure cut.\n\nThe scarlet Dior creation Lawrence wore to the Golden Globes would be considered nearly conservative were it not for strategic slivers of exposed abs. (Some preferred the casual Versace slip dress she switched to for the after-party.)\n\nMonths earlier, she chose a Dior gown for a Mockingjay 2 screening in Los Angeles. The high sheer netting might have read ice-skating matron had it not been for her \u201cfresh textured hair and bright lip,\u201d Ms. Kerr said.\n\nThe actor has been trying edgier gowns. \u201cIt helps that her looks can go from all-American to elegant to exotic,\u201d Ms. Kerr said. For the Mockingjay premiere in London, she picked a dramatically cut print Dior gown decorated with chains.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a silhouette or style I\u2019ve seen on her before,\u201d Ms. Kerr said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying something new, whereas her contemporaries are wearing strapless mermaid dresses with Veronica Lake waves,\u201d she added.\n\nBut perhaps her best recent look was a lingerie-like Schiaparelli couture confection worn to the Mockingjay premiere in New York, featuring a full skirt and sheer bodice layered over a bra. Paired with wine-coloured lips and layered necklaces, the dress had a kind of witchy magic.\n\n\u201cJennifer is definitely worth watching,\u201d Ms. Kerr said. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
