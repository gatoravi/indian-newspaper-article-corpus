Soon, a user by the name of Ganesh Aiyer sent an offensive tweet to her. Within an hour, another user, Rohan Kadam, reported the tweet to the official handle of the Mumbai Police, tagging Ms Tarar, who herself responded saying Aiyer had deleted the tweet but she had saved a screenshot, which she posted on the police\u2019s Twitter handle.\n\nThe police responded saying her complaint had been forwarded to the authorities concerned.\n\n\u201cThe cyber police station has been instructed to look into the matter,\u201d said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection) Dhananjay Kulkarni.\n\nMs Tarar later tweeted a message of thanks to the police. Aiyer attracted a slew of critical reactions over his tweets.",
