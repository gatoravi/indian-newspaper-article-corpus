    "text": "The five Dalit students of the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) had been on a sleep-in strike in the open on the University of Hyderabad campus ever since their expulsion.\n\nOn Sunday morning, following his 14th night out, Rohith Vemula had left the protesters\u2019 camp and spent the day in one of the rooms of the New Research Scholars\u2019 hostel.\n\nThe same evening at 7.30 p.m., he was found hanging in the room. The Gachchibowli Police registered a case naming Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment Bandaru Dattatreya, Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao and ABVP leader N. Susheel Kumar under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n\u201cI have not been named in the suicide note. I have nothing to do with it. I just received a petition about activities in the UoH which I forwarded to the MHRD. I have no role in this episode,\u201d Mr. Bandaru Dattatreya told The Hindu .\n\nRohith\u2019s five-page poignant suicide note , which went viral, triggered grief and much finger-pointing online.",
