Dulat, former chief of India\u2019s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), has said that the head of the agency should have an extended tenure, as it required a longer period to understand the job thoroughly.\n\nIn an interview with The Hindu here on Sunday, Mr. Dulat said he was an \u201caccidental chief\u201d but enjoyed his tenure and the three-and-a-half years at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office till 2004.\n\n\u201cThe only regret I had in the RAW was that I was chief for a year and a half. I wished I had a little more time,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the current norm of a two-year tenure, he said, \u201cIf only the \u2018two years\u2019 rule was there at that time, I would have got six months more as a consolation. You do feel that these jobs need a slightly longer tenure.\u201d\n\nThe chief of Britain\u2019s external intelligence agency MI-6 has a five-year tenure. \u201cNot only that. Most of them, when they retire, are knighted. It goes with the job. In India, once you are out, kalaas , finished!\u201d Mr. Dulat said.\n\nAsked to comment on the charges that the RAW had earlier funded banned organisations like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Hizbul Mujahideen, the former chief evaded a direct answer.\n\n\u201cLet me put it like this, if the agency is funding somebody, they are not saints. That\u2019s for sure, whoever they may be. [In] our business also, we deal with more sinners than saints. And it is the sinners, who are actually useful. You don\u2019t want saadhu aatma working for you,\u201d he said.",
