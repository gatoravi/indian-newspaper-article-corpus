The case we filed is the 25th. However, no action has ever been taken against him.\u201d She said it was surprising that the MLA was not named a \u201chistory-sheeter\u201d and was instead given a ticket by his party to contest the election.\n\nQuoting from an FIR filed by Rajasthan Administrative Service officer Ramniwas Mehta against Mr. Meena in 2005, Kavita Srivastava of the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties alleged that the MLA had threatened to kill Mr. Mehta after placing a revolver on his temple.\n\nOn Sunday, State BJP president Ashok Parnami issued a notice to the MLA, who represents the Manohar Thana Assembly constituency, asking him to submit his clarification within seven days on his involvement in the violence.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , the MLA on Sunday denied any role in the violence. By Monday evening, 11 persons of the \u201c30-35 unknown persons\u201d mentioned in the FIR were arrested. Video clippings of the MLA indulging in violence were submitted to the police.\n\nJhalawar Superintendent of Police Rajendra Singh told The Hindu : \u201cIf we find that the MLA has participated in the violence, the case against him would be investigated by the CID-Crime Branch.\u201d Mr. Singh confirmed that by Monday evening no action had been taken against Mr. Meena.\n\nCalling the assault \u201cpre-planned\u201d, Mr. Dey said it was an \u201cattack on democracy\u201d where goons wanted to inflict violence on people undertaking a peaceful yatra questioning the accountability of the government and raising awareness on government schemes across Rajasthan.",
