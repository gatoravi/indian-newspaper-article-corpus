    "text": "Pakistan on Monday lifted a ban on video-sharing site YouTube after Google launched a country-specific version ensuring the filtering out of content deemed blasphemous.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2012 had ordered a ban on the site after the Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.\n\nThe American-made film depicted the Prophet Mohammed as a thuggish deviant and triggered protests across the Muslim world \u2014 including in Pakistan, where more than 20 people died in demonstrations.\n\nBlasphemy is a contentious issue in Pakistan and the country has seen violent riots sparked by content considered offensive to Islam.\n\nLast week Google said it had launched a localised version of the site in Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, meaning Pakistani authorities can now ask Google to remove content deemed objectionable.\n\nOn Monday, authorities said the ban had been lifted.\n\n\u201cPakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Monday directed the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to unblock YouTube with immediate effect,\u201d a government official said. Wahajus Siraj, chief executive officer of internet service provider Nayatel Private Limited, confirmed receiving the instruction. He added that he did not find blasphemous content on the website, saying that some videos came up with a notification that they had been blocked.\n\nGoogle has said that it would review requests before taking videos down. \u2014 AFP\n\nAuthorities can now ask Google to remove content deemed objectionable or blasphemous",
