    "text": "Former West Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi wrote to Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje on Monday, urging her to condemn the attack on a peaceful procession led by social activist Aruna Roy three days ago and institute an inquiry into the incident.\n\nThe attack on the procession of Mazdoor Kisana Shakti Sangathan in Jhalawar, captured on camera, has gone viral. Mr. Gandhi drew Ms. Raje\u2019s attention to the non-partisan nature of the organisation, which has been consistent in demanding accountability from State governments in securing the rights of the common man.\n\n\u201cA video showing the violent attack is on the Net and I am sure you have had the chance to see its incredible footage... For a peaceful procession to be subjected to physical violence in your State and home district must cause you no ordinary concern. You have known the internationally respected Aruna Roy for many years. That successive governments of Rajasthan have been questioned by her and asked to raise their levels of accountability is widely known. She and her associates are credited, without any exaggeration, as the greatest catalysts of transparency through the mechanism of the Right to Information Act,\u201d Mr. Gandhi\u2019s letter stated.\n\nMr. Gandhi wrote that the attack was not just an \u201cepisode\u201d but constitutes a much deeper setback to the processes of democratic articulation and peaceful protest.",
