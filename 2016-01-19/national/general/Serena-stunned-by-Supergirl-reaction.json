    "text": "Serena dreams of superhero role\n\nTennis ace Serena Williams on Monday said she was stunned by the reaction to a Facebook post she made that went viral, comparing herself to Supergirl after chasing down a hapless telephone thief.\n\nThe world number one revealed in November that a thief stole her phone at a Chinese restaurant in New York. The robber clearly picked the wrong woman, with the super-fit Williams chasing him in the street and getting it back.\n\nThe American detailed the adventure on Facebook, complete with a picture of her in a Supergirl outfit, while urging her followers to: \u201cFight for what\u2019s right. Stand for what you believe in.\u201d\n\nAsked if any crime-fighting job offers had come her way, she replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m still looking to get some action roles. Maybe a superhero. That\u2019s my dream,\u201d she said. \u2014 AFP",
