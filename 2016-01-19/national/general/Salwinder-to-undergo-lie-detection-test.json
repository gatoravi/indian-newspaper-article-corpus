The court has directed the federal investigation agency to conduct the test within three days.\n\nEarlier, NIA sleuths, along with the officer, arrived in the court of District Judge Amarnath and moved an application seeking permission to conduct the test on him.\n\nCounsel for the investigating agency submitted before the court that there had been \u2018inconsistencies\u2019 in the statements given by Mr. Singh during questioning and, therefore, it should be allowed to conduct the test on him.\n\nMr. Singh, who is also one of the prime witnesses in the case, had earlier claimed that he was abducted by terrorists in the early hours on January 1, when he was reportedly returning from a mazar at a village in the border district of Gurdaspur.\n\nHe was accompanied by his jeweller friend Rajesh Verma and cook Madan Gopal.\n\nMr. Singh is presently an Assistant Commandant of the 75{+t}{+h}Battalion of the Punjab Armed Police.",
