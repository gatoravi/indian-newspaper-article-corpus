    "text": "Data collected by Rosetta spacecraft\n\nResearchers, including one of Indian-origin, have identified two large patches of water ice on the surface of comet 67P, perhaps the most studied comet in history.\n\nThe elusive ice was detected, using data collected by the European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta spacecraft, on the bottom part of the main lobe of the dumbbell-shaped comet, in a region called Imhotep.\n\nIt appeared as noticeably bright patches in visible light and was located on cliff walls and debris falls, researchers said.\n\n\u201cIt looked like there was a breakage, or something fell on the surface of the comet, and a large, new inside area that had water ice was exposed,\u201d said Murthy Gudipati from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California, and one of the paper\u2019s authors.\n\nData collected by Rosetta\u2019s Visible Infrared and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) showed that the water ice grains in the Imhotep region came in different sizes. Some of the grains were tiny, just tens of micrometres across, which were probably formed as a result of the comet\u2019s 12-hour rotation.\n\nThe findings were published in Nature . \u2013 PTI",
