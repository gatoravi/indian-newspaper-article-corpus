    "text": "Accusing the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal of \u201cprotecting criminals\u201d Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Nitin Gadkari, along other senior BJP leaders, on Monday raked up the issue of Malda violence at a public rally in the adjoining Dakshin Dinjapur district.\n\n\u201cWho are those who set the police station on fire\u2026why no action has been taken against them. Why those involved in poppy cultivation and fake currency are not punished,\u201d Mr. Gadkari asked at the rally.\n\nAddressing the rally at Buniyaadpur, the former BJP president alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is engaging in \u201cvote bank politics\u201d with an eye on the upcoming Assembly polls.\n\nMr. Gadkari said that the BJP leaders were in the State to seek answers as to \u201cwhy the culprits are spared by police and the honest citizens are being persecuted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you had taken the oath as the Chief Minister, you had sworn to protect the poor citizens of State. Now tell me, you are not protecting the poor citizens. Instead, you are protecting the criminals, hooligans, who are taking law in their hands who are looting and burning police stations,\u201d he said. The Minister also said if BJP was voted to power in the State, it would take strong action against those indulging in criminal and illegal activities.\n\nBJP national general secretary in-charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya and observer Siddharth Nath Singh also said that action had not been taken against those involved in Kaliachak because of \u201cvote bank politics.\u201d",
