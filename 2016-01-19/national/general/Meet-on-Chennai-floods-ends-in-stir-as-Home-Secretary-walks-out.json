    "text": "The parliamentary standing committee for home affairs meeting to discuss the recent floods in Tamil Nadu ended in protest after Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi left the meeting halfway, even as the issue was being discussed by members of Parliament.\n\nSources present at the meeting told The Hindu that the meeting was to hear presentations from the Union Home Ministry and State government officials on the extent of the damage wrought by the floods, but the meeting remained inconclusive due to the departure of Mr. Mehrishi.\n\n\u201cThe presentation by the Ministry detailed that the loss of lives in the floods in the State was pegged at 470, with damage to over 2.7 lakh homes and nearly 3 lakh hectares of crop land. Scarcely had these figures been shared when the home secretary was called away,\u201d said a senior MP present at the meeting.\n\nThe departure prompted protests from \u201calmost every MP who is a member of the committee as the standing committee is considered a mini-Parliament and its proceedings should not be disrupted in this way.\u201d\n\nThe meeting ended early for this reason and MPs have decided to take up the matter in their next meeting for which a date has not been decided. Chairman of the committee P Bhattacharya of the Congress confirmed to The Hindu that the meeting \u201cwas inconclusive\u201d and that \u201cwe will take this up again when we meet next.\u201d\n\nParliamentary panel meet on Chennai floods ends in protests as home secy leaves midway",
