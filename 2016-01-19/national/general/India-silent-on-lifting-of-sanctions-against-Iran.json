She was also welcomed in a public event featuring Israeli and Indian entrepreneurs and supporters.\n\nHowever, commentators have noted that the lifting of sanctions was on expected lines and therefore India was prepared to balance the outreach to Israel with the Iranian development.\n\n\u201cThe end of the sanctions regime was announced soon after the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) so there is no surprise with the successful lifting of the sanctions. That apart, India is aware that the Israelis have not been in favour of the nuclear deal,\u201d said Arundhati Ghose, former ambassador of India to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva who explained that India has to maintain a cautious approach while dealing with the mutually exclusive rivals of West Asia.\n\nMs. Ghose, said the message from the end of the crisis over Iran is loud and clear and is being heard by the West Asian rivals of Iran.\n\nIsraeli sources also took note of India\u2019s careful attitude on Iran while Ms. Swaraj is in Israel. Anat Bernstein-Reich, Chairperson of Israel-India Chamber of Commerce, feels that by being diplomatic India seem to be asserting its regional stature.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that India is in a position to be a central political player in the West Asian/Middle Eastern neighbourhood as it enjoys good relations with all the major players in the region,\u201d Ms. Bernstein-Reich told The Hindu .\n\nIn Israel, Sushma Swaraj held talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Rivlin",
