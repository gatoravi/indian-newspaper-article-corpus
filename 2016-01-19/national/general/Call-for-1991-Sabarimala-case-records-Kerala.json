Paripoornan and K.B. Marar held that the prohibition imposed by the Travancore Devaswom Board was not violative of Articles 15, 25 and 26 of the Constitution. Neither was it violative of the provisions of the Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 as the prohibition was only in respect of women of a particular age group and not women as a class.\n\nThe HC also examined Ravivarma Raja of the Pandalam royal family, to which the temple belonged, and the Ayyappa Seva Sangham secretary. The judgment referred to the belief that the deity is a \u2018Naisthik Brahmachari.\u2019\n\nSenior advocate V. Giri, appearing for Kerala, urged the special three-judge Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra to summon the records of the 1991 case. \u201cAccording to him, these customs and usages had to be followed for the welfare of the temple. He said only persons who had observed penance and followed the customs are eligible to enter the temple and it is not proper for young women to do so,\u201d the 1991 judgment had said. Twenty-five years after this High Court judgment, the Supreme Court has questioned the \u201clogic\u201d behind the restriction, even wondering whether there was any proof that women did not enter the sanctum sanctorum 1,500 years ago.",
