    "text": "Abdul Sami is the fifth suspected AQIS militant arrested by the Delhi police in the recent past ever since this module was busted in December last year. The previous arrest was that of a madrasa teacher from Bengaluru on January 6.\n\nThe police said they learnt of Sami\u2019s AQIS links during the interrogation of Abdul Rehman, another suspect arrested from Cuttack in mid-December. \u201cSami and Rehman knew each other since 2001,\u201d said a senior officer.\n\nSami was only 16 years old when he had allegedly met Rehman during a religious ceremony where the latter delivered \u201cprovocative speeches to motivate Muslim youth to take to jihad.\u201d\n\nA native of Jamshedpur and an electrician by profession, Sami is the second suspected AQIS militant from that place to be allegedly indoctrinated by Rehman and sent to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nPolice said that Sami\u2019s brief interrogation so far has revealed that he first visited Dubai on a work visa in January 2014 and then entered Pakistan for training with the help of LeT agents based in the two countries.\n\nHaving obtained training in \u201cusing sophisticated weapons, preparing bombs, dealing with internet and computers,\u201d Sami returned to India in January last year, said police.\n\n\u201cHe returned to India via Sharjah and Kathmandu. He was set to be given a major task, but was temporarily told to lie low,\u201d said the officer. Fear of being nabbed made him flee his hometown and reach Nuh in Haryana\u2019s Mewat region. He was produced before a city court that sent him to police custody till February 1.",
