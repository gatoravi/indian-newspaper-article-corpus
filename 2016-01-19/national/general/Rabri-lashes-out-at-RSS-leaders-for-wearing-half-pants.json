    "text": "The former Bihar Chief Minister, Rabri Devi, has criticised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for adopting double standards in its approach and asked elder members of the organisation, if they weren\u2019t ashamed to \u201ccome out in public wearing half-pants.\u201d She also questioned RSS members attacking the RJD for its lathi rally when they themselves carry lathis [sticks].\n\n\u201cWhat type of organisation is the RSS in which even old people wear knickers\u2026 don\u2019t they feel ashamed of coming out in public wearing half-pants?,\u201d said Ms. Devi, while addressing the 9th triennial open session of the RJD\u2019s national council in Patna on Sunday.\n\nParty delegates from 21 States attended the meeting in which her husband Lalu Prasad was re-elected party president for the ninth consecutive term.\n\n\u201cRSS men themselves carry lathis. Then why do they and the BJP leaders term the RJD \u2018lathi mein tel pilawan party [party that puts oil on sticks]\u2019,\u201d asked Ms. Devi.\n\n\u201cIf it is a practice for RSS men to carry lathis in their daily training camps, then why do they mock the RJD when its workers were asked to come to a rally with lathis in Patna?\u201d\n\nMs. Devi called upon the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) leaders to remain united. \u201cIf you remain united, the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance government will continue for 20 years in Bihar,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Devi also referred to the recent controversy over Mr. Prasad issuing instruction to health officials, doctors and making \u201csurprise inspection\u201d of government-run hospitals, and said, \u201cLaluji has every right to inquire about people\u2019s problems.\u201d",
