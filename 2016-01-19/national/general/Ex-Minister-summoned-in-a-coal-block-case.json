The court asked them to appear before it on February 26. The case pertains to the allocation of Brahmadiha coal block in Giridih in Jharkhand to Castron Technologies Ltd in 1999 in an illegal manner. The court summoned them under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC and also under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Stating that there is prima facie enough evidence to summon them as accused in the case, the court said: \u201cThe public servants, in fact, actively connived with private parties involved so as to facilitate misappropriation of nationalised natural resources of the country by them.\u201d",
