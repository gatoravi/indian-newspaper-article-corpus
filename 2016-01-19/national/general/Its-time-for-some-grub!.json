    "text": "Austrian entrepreneurs develop device to breed edible mealworms\n\nA seething mass of larvae in the kitchen is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But for two young Austrian entrepreneurs, it\u2019s a food revolution that can help save the planet.\n\nKatharina Unger and Julia Kaisinger, 25 and 28, have developed a device to breed in the comfort of your own home the protein-rich grubs of the meal beetle, to then eat. \u201cWith this current design you can make 200-500 grams (seven to 18 ounces) of mealworms every week,\u201d Ms. Unger said at a recent tasting and fundraising event in Vienna.\n\n\u201cYou freeze them and then you make them like any other type of meat. You can cook them, roast them, make them into burger patties and mix them into sauce for pasta,\u201d she said.\n\nInto the top of the sleek, white \u201cdesktop hive\u201d go pupae which then hatch into adults. In the next section, the insects mate and their eggs fall into the next layer. Helped by a controlled microclimate, the eggs hatch into larvae which gradually grow and descend to a drawer at the bottom where, around three centimetres long and plump, they are harvested.\n\n\u201cOur team eats them almost every day,\u201d Ms. Unger said, showing off some of her creations \u2014 Greek salads topped by toasted grubs, quinoa-and-mealworm meatballs and even chocolate (and worm) cake.\n\nMs. Unger said that insects are not only tasty but a more sustainable source of protein than traditional farmed livestock. \u2014 AFP\n\nA few insect restaurants have sprung up in Europe and North America in recent years, and some products, ranging from salt-and-vinegar crickets to lollipops with scorpions (actually arachnids), are available",
