    "text": "The Kerala government on Monday urged the Supreme Court to consider the assertion made in 1991 by the then Sabarimala Thanthri Sri Neelakandaru that women belonging to the 10 to 50 age group were prohibited from entering the temple even before 1950.\n\nA Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had examined him on April 5, 1991, before it upheld the restriction on women of that age group offering worship at the Sabarimala shrine.\n\nSummon records\n\nSenior advocate V. Giri, appearing for Kerala, urged the special three-judge Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra to summon the records of the 1991 case. \u201cAccording to him, these customs and usages had to be followed for the welfare of the temple. He said only persons who had observed penance and followed the customs are eligible to enter the temple and it is not proper for young women to do so,\u201d the 1991 judgment had said.\n\nTwenty-five years after this High Court judgment, the Supreme Court has questioned the \u201clogic\u201d behind the restriction, even wondering whether there was any proof that women did not enter the sanctum sanctorum 1,500 years ago.",
