    "text": "The High Court had rejected minority status to Sikhs in Punjab on the grounds that the community was numerically strong. Moreover, it had held that the Punjab government had produced no material to show that Sikhs \u201capprehended deprivation of their religious, cultural or educational rights in the State from any other community, which may be in majority and which may gain political power in the elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the issue here is whether Sikhs are a minority or a majority in Punjab... This is a serious issue,\u201d the CJI observed. \u201cCan Muslims, who are in majority in Kashmir, still be treated as minority? Can Sikhs be minority in Punjab? Can Christians be minority in Meghalaya?\u201d he asked. The Constitution Bench drew a parallel between the High Court\u2019s conclusion in 2007 and the Supreme Court judgment in the 2005 Bal Patil case concerning the religious minority status of Jains.\n\nIn the Bal Patil judgment, the Supreme Court had held that a community should be protected as a minority only if there was an apprehension that the community may be \u201cdominated\u201d by other communities.\n\n\u201cMinority as understood from constitutional scheme signifies an identifiable group of people or community who were seen as deserving protection from likely deprivation of their religious, cultural and educational rights by other communities who happen to be in majority and likely to gain political power in a democratic form of Government based on election,\u201d the 2005 Patil judgment by then CJI M.N. Venkatachaliah had observed.\n\nThe case has been posted after four weeks for a detailed hearing.",
