Any man or woman who fulfils the criteria of knowledge and training can become a Qazi,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWomen in Islam have all the right to become religious scholars. They can become a Qazi and a Mufti. Islam doesn\u2019t discriminate between men and women when it comes to gathering knowledge,\u201d Maulana Usmani said.\n\nArguing that there was nothing in Islam that prohibits women from becoming a Qazi or a Mufti, Maulana Usmani said those who protest against women becoming Qazis don\u2019t do justice with the rights Islam bestows on women.\n\n'Islam empowers women'\n\n\u201cIslam empowers women through knowledge. Nobody has any right to prevent women from becoming a Qazi or a Mufti,\u201d he said.\n\nMaulana Usmani also said there was no reason for anyone to oppose the two Qazis because there are \u201cseveral madrasas that train women to become a Qazi or a Mufti.\u201d\n\nZakia Soman, the trustee of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan that runs the Darul Uloom-e-Niswa which trained the two women from Jaipur, welcomed the reaction of the seminary.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed an encouraging and positive reaction from Darul Uloom Deoband. This shows that they are moving with the times and are acknowledging the sense of empowerment accorded to women by Islam,\u201d Ms. Soman said.\n\nMaulana says any man or woman who has training and knowledge can become a Qazi",
