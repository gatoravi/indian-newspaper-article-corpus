At present, the pictorial warning occupies only 50 per cent package space.\n\n2 lakh beedi workers\n\nThere are more than 15 beedi companies providing employment to around 2 lakh beedi workers in the district.\n\nThe closure of the companies would displace beedi workers and cause unrest, said Ramesh, a contractor (thekadhar) of a beedi company in Karimnagar town.\n\nHe said the Union government should rethink its decision and continue the existing rule.\n\nThe Centre's order calls for a larger pictorial warning\n\nand images\n\non packets",
