    "text": "British researchers have identified a key protein that can control how breast cancer cells spread in the body. The study sheds light on how cancer cells leave the blood vessels to travel to a new part of the body, said the researchers from University of Manchester in Britain.\n\nWhen tumour cells spread, they first enter the blood stream and grip onto the inner walls of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nThe cancer cells control a receptor protein called EPHA2 in order to push their way out of the vessels. When these cancer cells interact with the walls of the blood vessels, EPHA2 is activated and the tumour cells remain inside the blood vessels. When the EPHA2 is inactive, the tumour cells can push out and spread, said the study published in the journal Science Signaling . \u2014 IANS",
