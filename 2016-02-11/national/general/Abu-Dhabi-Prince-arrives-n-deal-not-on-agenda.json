Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally received him at the airport with a warm embrace. Though the official part of the visit is scheduled for Thursday, both sides held a round of discussions immediately after his arrival.\n\nThe Crown Prince held talks with the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in his first meeting in Delhi to revise the plan of diplomatic engagements for Thursday. Sultan Al Mansoori, Minister of Economy, UAE, who is part of the delegation, called on his counterpart Arun Jaitley. A press release from the Government said that Mr. Jaitley and Mr. Mansoori focused on investment, innovation and Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\nOn Monday, UAE Ambassador Ahmed Al-Banna told the media that at least sixteen agreements, including one on nuclear collaboration, were expected to be signed during the visit of the Crown Prince. However, officials told The Hindu that only \u201cinitial conversations\u201d on the nuclear issue were on the cards. \u201cNuclear issues will be agreed as an area of cooperation. There is no bilateral civil nuclear cooperation treaty under negotiation yet with the UAE.\u201d \u201cThe only agreement that we can confirm right now is the one for visa free travel for Indian diplomats to the UAE,\u201d said a diplomatic source. Many of the agreements, he said, were still being finalised.\n\nSovereign Fund\n\nThis is Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed\u2019s third visit to India, but his first as crown prince. \u201cWe brought him for an official visit when he was Commander of the forces in 2003,\u201d said former Ambassador to the UAE K.C. Singh. \u201cIndia has wasted a lot of time engaging with the UAE leadership since then, as we were not ready for closer cooperation at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe main bilateral meeting d at Hyderabad House on Thursday is expected to throw up a clutch of agreements. Earlier, Anil Wadhwa, Secretary (East), said India was eyeing the $ 800 billion Sovereign Fund of the UAE, which it hoped to access especially for investments in infrastructure sector.\n\nSheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed will also discuss the newly announced Strategic Partnership, where UAE\u2019s cooperation on terror is a major highlight. In the past few months, many Indians suspected of IS links have been detained and deported to India.",
