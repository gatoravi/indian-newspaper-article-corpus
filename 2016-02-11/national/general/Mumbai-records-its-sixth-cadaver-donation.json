She was getting off the local train at Nalasopara on February 6 when she fell down and suffered a head injury.\n\nShe was taken to Alliance hospital, also in Nalasopara, for treatment. She was declared clinically brain dead on February 8, and her family expressed the desire to donate her organs.\n\nSince the hospital was not registered on the organ transplant network, the family, showing exceptional drive, contacted the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee themselves. The ZTCC officials, in turn, contacted Jupiter Hospital to move her to their facility. She was moved to Jupiter on the intervening night of February 8 and 9.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, her heart was retrieved and rushed to Fortis Hospital in Mulund and the transplant procedure completed in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nThe liver transplant procedure on the 65-year-old too started at 6 am at Jupiter hospital and was completed after around nine hours.",
