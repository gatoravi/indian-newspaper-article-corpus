The event \u2014 World Culture Festival \u2014 is also drawing criticism from those who oppose mixing diplomacy with new age spirituality.\n\n\u201cThe agenda of the Ministry of External Affairs should not include Art of Living. Moreover, all the diplomatic delegates coming for the conference also have led lives that have been far from spiritual. So why this collaboration between the MEA and the Art of Living?\u201d asked former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh.\n\nOfficials told The Hindu that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\u2019s inclusion in the MEA\u2019s agenda is backed by the international standing that he enjoys. The Art of Living founder recently met with Deputy Prime Minister of Nepal Kamal Thapa, which reportedly helped in creating a breakthrough between the leadership of India and Nepal. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar also emerged as a unique connector between India and Pakistan because of the popularity of \u2018Art of Living\u2019 in Lahore and Islamabad. (Pakistan\u2019s National Security Adviser Sartaj Aziz is reported to have attended Art of Living meetings in Pakistan.)\n\nConsultations have begun between the volunteers and the MEA officials on how to ensure an incident-free festival, which will feature CEO of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah, former President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa, former Pakistan PM Yousaf Raza Gilani and a host of other dignitaries.",
