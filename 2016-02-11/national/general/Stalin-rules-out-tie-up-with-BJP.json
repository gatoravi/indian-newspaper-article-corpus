Stalin welcomes the Art of Living Foundation founder Sri Sri Ravishankar who called on him at his residence on Wednesday.\n\nDMK treasurer M.K. Stalin on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of his party aligning with the BJP in the 2016 Assembly elections.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the reports that the BJP and the DMK could come together to face the election. But we are happy that those who described us as untouchables are after us now,\u201d Mr Stalin told The Hindu reiterating that there was no formal communication from the BJP on a possible alliance.\n\nMr Stalin on Wednesday met Sri Sri Ravishankar, the founder of Art of Living Foundation, who is perceived to be close to the BJP. However, the DMK leader described it as a personal visit.\n\n\u201cWhen I visited him in Bengaluru sometime ago, he promised to meet me during his visit to Chennai. He also congratulated me over phone when I was undertaking flood relief work. Today, he also appreciated my Namakku Naame road show,\u201d said Mr Stalin who has so far completed four rounds of the outreach programme.\n\nSri Sri reportedly invited Mr Stalin for a function to be held on March 11 and 12 in Delhi. \u201cBut I told him that I may not be in a position to take part as I will be busy with election work,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, DMK leader M. Karunanidhi joined issue with CPI (M) state secretary G. Ramakrishnan as the latter had alleged that both the DMK and the AIADMK had not done anything constructive for the betterment of the poor.",
