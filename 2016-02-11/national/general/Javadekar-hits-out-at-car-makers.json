    "text": "Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday hit out at carmakers for their criticism of Delhi\u2019s air pollution and said he never thought of a car as a \u201ccleaning machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarmakers are making some crazy statements... I never thought of a car not emitting carbon but being a cleaning machine. I never thought about it. If somebody is going crazy I can\u2019t help it,\u201d Mr. Javadekar said, while speaking at an Assocham event on smart cities.\n\nHe was referring to Jaguar Land Rover CEO Ralph Speth\u2019s comments on Sunday that the air sucked in by the company\u2019s latest technology cars was dirtier than what they emit on Delhi roads.\n\n\u201cThe latest EU (Euro) VI regulation schemes have got technical features, which [can] clean the air in Delhi. These kind of vehicles drive like a hoover... The air they suck in is far dirtier than the air which comes out of it,\u201d Mr. Speth told PTI.\n\nMercedes-Benz India MD and CEO Roland Folger told The Hindu in an interview last week that switching to petrol vehicles was no solution to pollution as it emits higher CO2 levels than diesel.\n\n\u201c\u2026We know from our experience in Europe that by switching from diesel to petrol you are increasing CO2 levels. Petrol cars by definition have roughly 25 per cent higher CO2 levels,\u201d Mr. Folger had said.",
