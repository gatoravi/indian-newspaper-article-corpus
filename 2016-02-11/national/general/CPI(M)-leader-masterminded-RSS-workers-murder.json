Jayarajan was the \u201ckingpin and mastermind\u2019\u2019 of the criminal conspiracy hatched to murder Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh worker E. Manoj.\n\nThe CBI made the submission before the Bench of Justice K.T. Sankaran and Justice K.P. Jyothindranath when an anticipatory bail petition filed by Mr. Jayarajan came up for hearing. Mr. Jayarajan, arraigned as the 25th accused, also challenged the Thalassery Sessions Court order rejecting his anticipatory bail plea in the case.\n\nHe has been charged with offences under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).
