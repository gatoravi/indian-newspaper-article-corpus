In some areas, large groups of people carrying sticks were seen patrolling near grassland patches in search of the \u2018elusive\u2019 feline.\n\nNearly 40 officials of the Forest Department and the local police descended on the area to verify the \u2018sightings\u2019.\n\nWhile many pug marks were dismissed as those of a dog, on Wednesday evening a suspicious \u2018pug mark\u2019 at Nellurhalli saw the department placing a cage there. Another was kept behind Vibgyor school.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking any chances,\u201d said Jaganath Reddy, Deputy Range Forest Officer. With calls of \u2018fresh sightings\u2019 by fear-stricken residents pouring in through Tuesday night and Wednesday, Forest Department officials at Whitefield spent much of their time attending to what they said were \u2018hoax\u2019 calls.\n\n\u201cSome claim numerous people have spotted a leopard, but when we go to the scene, not one person will be there or will confirm. We have to attend to each call and go to the spot to verify. Almost every hour, we are forced to go to either Nellurhalli or Vibgyor School (a distance of around 5 km),\u201d said an officer.\n\nThe \u2018sighting\u2019 was first reported at Nellurhalli on Tuesday afternoon. Officials rushed there. The search was called off after nearly three hours as officials were convinced that there was no leopard around.\n\nHowever, barely a few hours later, more calls started coming.\n\nForest personnel from Anekal and K.R. Puram sub-divisions have been camping in the area since Sunday when a leopard entered Vibgyor School.\n\nIt started off with \u2018sightings\u2019 and is being fuelled by \u2018visuals\u2019 telecast by television channels",
