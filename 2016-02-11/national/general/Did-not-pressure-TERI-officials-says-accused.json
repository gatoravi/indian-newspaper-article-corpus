    "text": "The newly appointed executive vice-chairman of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), R.K. Pachauri, on Wednesday denied the allegation that he had pressured the organisation\u2019s officials in the matter of the sexual harassment case registered against him by a former woman colleague.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in the Delhi High Court in response to a fresh charge levelled by the complainant in her petition seeking cancellation of his anticipatory bail, Mr. Pachauri said the allegation that he had instructed one of the TERI officials to persuade her for an out-of-court settlement was incorrect.\n\nMr. Pachauri said the complainant\u2019s allegation was misleading and a \u201cfigment of imagination\u201d. He said it was a matter of record that he was away from TERI between February and July last year and it was only after the permission of the sessions court that he was allowed to enter the office. \u201cThe trial court monitoring the investigation has consistently held that the answering respondent has cooperated and never violated any conditions of the bail,\u201d said Mr.Pachauri in his reply to the notice issued to him on January 28. He also sought dismissal of the petition, while claiming that it was motivated and not maintainable in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe High Court had asked Mr.Pachauri to explain his stand on the fresh application moved by the complainant, who has now quit TERI, just a day before the court was to pronounce its order on her petition.",
