At the launch of the book \u201cLal Lakeer\u201d on Wednesday, former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury found themselves fielding tough questions that touched upon issues such as state-sponsored vigilantism that led to alleged human rights violations in Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh.\n\nA fictional account written by a reputed TV journalist Hridyesh Joshi, Lal Lakeer is a love story set in insurgency-hit Chhattisgarh. The book portrays a microcosm where the State and the insurgents end up ruining the lives of disadvantaged people.\n\n\u2018Many shortcomings\u2019\n\nMr. Ramesh was asked what could be done to reverse the culture of vigilantism that was introduced by the previous Congress-led government in Chhattisgarh. \u201cThe Forest Ministry has a big role to play in that mess,\u201d he answered. \u201cShortcomings are many \u2014 good officers don\u2019t want to serve in such places, good cops don\u2019t want to be posted there.\u201d\n\nMr. Ramesh added that Maoism was an administrative problem, a conclusion Mr. Yechury disagreed with.\n\nMr. Yechury said Maoism could be dealt only politically. Had the Congress not allowed private companies to exploit the resources in tribal areas, the Maoist insurgency would have lost its steam, he said. \u201cUntil you go to this root, how would you find a solution?\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha took a dig at the Congress and CPI(M), saying both parties were to blame for alienating those tribals who had joined the Maoist ranks. \u201cIt\u2019s important to tackle Maoist violence through proper democratic frameworks,\u201d Mr.Sinha said.",
