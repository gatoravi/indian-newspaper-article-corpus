This comes a day after Guru\u2019s third death anniversary.\n\nThe university administration has ordered a \u201cdisciplinary\u201d enquiry into the issue as it said the event organisers \u201cwent ahead without permission.\u201d\n\nThe event organisers had pasted posters across the campus inviting students to gather for a protest march against \u201cjudicial killing of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat\u201d and in solidarity with the \u201cstruggle\u201d of Kashmiri migrants at the Sabarmati dhaba in the campus.\n\nUniversity officials said the act amounted to \u201cindiscipline\u201d as any talk about national disintegration cannot be \u201cnational\u201d, adding that a committee headed by the Chief Proctor of JNU would investigate the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is an act of indiscipline as permission for the programme was sought by providing incomplete information. A committee headed by the Chief Proctor will examine the footage of the event and speak to the witnesses. The varsity will take appropriate action based on the report,\u201d JNU Vice-Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar said.\n\nExplaining the \u201cincomplete information\u201d, a varsity official said there was no mention of Afzal Guru in the permission letter. Members of the ABVP had on Tuesday objected to the event and written to the Vice-Chancellor saying such marches should not be held on the campus of an educational institution, prompting the university administration to order cancellation of the march fearing it might \u201cdisrupt peace on the campus.\u201d\n\nHowever, the organisers went ahead with the programme despite the cancellation of the permission, and held a \u201ccultural programme.\u201d\n\nABVP members gathered outside the V-C\u2019s office and shouted slogans, demanding the expulsion of the students.\n\nJoint Secretary of the JNU students union, Saurabh Kumar, the only ABVP member in the union, said, \u201cHow can an event on Afzal Guru, who attacked the temple of democracy, be held here? We demand the expulsion of those who organised it\u201d.",
