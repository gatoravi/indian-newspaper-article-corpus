A commissioning mother or women having babies through surrogacy will also get 16 weeks of paid leave from the date of handing over of the child,\u201d a senior Labour Ministry official told The Hindu . The idea was to allow women to take care of the child and then get back to work in a healthy condition\n\n\u201cIt is a very commendable move,\u201d said Dr. Sushila Gupta, a practising gynaecologist at Sanjivani Nursing Home here. \u201cSix and a half months is a good time period for women to get back to work after delivering a baby. Already, a lot of companies have increased maternity leave to around six months to encourage women\u2019s participation in the workforce.\u201d\n\nWhile Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi had suggested raising maternity leave to eight months from three months, women\u2019s unions said the government\u2019s move to raise the leave to six months is a good start and the benefit must be extended to those working in the unorganised sector.\n\nJagmati Sangwan, general-secretary, All-India Democratic Women\u2019s Association, said it was a very positive step. \u201cWe appeal to the government not to add any conditions to the proposed benefits. Also, these benefits must reach the unorganised sector as well.\u201d\n\nGlobally, around 98 countries provided maternity benefit of at least 14 weeks till 2013, said a report titled \u2018Maternity and Paternity at Work\u2019 prepared by the International Labour Organisation. Forty-two countries gave 18 weeks of paid maternity leave.\n\nWomen working in government offices in India get a six-month maternity leave, according to the Central Civil Service (Leave) Rules 1972.\n\nCabinet to also consider 4 months\u2019 leave for women having babies through surrogacy",
