    "text": "It has taken scientists over 300 years to finally figure out how bacteria \u201csee\u201d their world, and they do it in a remarkably similar way to us.\n\nThe team of British and German researchers revealed how bacterial cells act as the equivalent of a microscopic eyeball or the world\u2019s oldest and smallest camera eye.\n\nCyanobacteria are found in huge numbers in water bodies or can form a slippery green film on rocks and pebbles.\n\nSynechocystis \u2014 the species used in the study \u2014 is found naturally in freshwater lakes and rivers.\n\nAs light hits the spherical cell body of the bacteria, it refracts into a point on the other side of the cell. This triggers movement by the cell away from the focused spot.\n\nWithin minutes, the bacteria grow tiny tentacle-like structures called pili that reach out towards the light source. As they attach to the surface that they\u2019re on, they retract and pull the bacteria along.\n\n\u201cThe physical principles for the sensing of light by bacteria and the far more complex vision in animals are similar but the biological structures are different,\u201d noted co-author Annegret Wilde from the University of Freiburg in Germany in a paper that appeared in the journal eLife . \u2014 IANS",
