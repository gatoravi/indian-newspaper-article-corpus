    "text": "The Gujarat government has said it is hopeful of striking a compromise with the Patel community in the near future. State government representatives have been holding a series of meetings with Patel community leaders to work out a compromise to withdraw the agitation seeking reservation benefits. \u201cThe government has withdrawn police cases. A few more cases will be withdrawn as the government wants peace in the State,\u201d said Health Minister and government spokesman Nitin Patel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jayram Vansjalia, a prominent leader of the Patel community from the Saurashtra region, said a committee has been formed to broker a compromise.\n\n\u201cI can say the government\u2019s approach is positive for finding a compromise formula if the quota leaders are ready to soften their stand,\u201d Mr. Vansjalia said after meeting agitation leader Hardik Patel at the Sabarmati central jail in Ahmedabad.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Hardik Patel told media in Surat that any compromise with the State government would be limited to withdrawal of cases filed against the community members during the agitation last year.",
