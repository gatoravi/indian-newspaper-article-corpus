    "text": "Telangana legislators are pushing for a substantial hike in their salaries and it was being considered by the Telugu Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government but the demand was questioned by Opposition Congress which on Wednesday dubbed it \u201cshameful and insensitive\u201d when farmers in the State were committing suicides.\n\nThe MLAs and MLCs have cited \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d pay package for their demand, with senior Congress MP V. Hanumantha Rao saying they are seeking a \u201c200 per cent\u201d hike.\n\nIn the 119-member Telangana Assembly, the TRS has 76 MLAs, while 15 are from the Congress.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Mohammed Ali backed the demand of the legislators, saying there has been no increment in salaries since many years.\n\nThe government is examining the issue of increasing the salaries of MLAs and MLCs in view of their \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d pay structure, according to a government release.\n\nTRS MP B. Vinod Kumar said the salary being presently drawn by the MLAs is \u201cnot enough\u201d even to meet basic needs.\n\nSeveral MLAs and MLCs have submitted representations in this regard to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and also Legislature Secretary in recent times, according to the release.\n\nThe legislators currently draw Rs. 95,000 per month and their salary bill, coupled with those with the Cabinet rank, would be to the tune of Rs. 14.94 crore per annum, it stated. As per an estimate, around Rs. 3 lakh is spent every month by the MLAs and MLCs to meet expenses. \u2014 PTI",
