    "text": "President Pranab Mukherjee on Wednesday exhorted Governors to act within the framework of the Constitution, saying \u201cthey must not only be fair, but also be seen to be fair\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the concluding session of a two-day conference of Governors, Mr. Mukherjee said they had the responsibility to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\n\nThe remarks assume importance in the wake of the recent controversy over the role of Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa, leading to President\u2019s rule in the State.\n\nIn his address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Governors occupied a unique, high position because of their experience and post and could be \u201ccatalytic agents in the States, speeding up and improving processes without themselves becoming a part of them\u201d.\n\nStressing \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d, Mr. Modi said the Centre and the States must work together as \u201cTeam India\u201d. The spirit of cooperative federalism must also extend to cooperative, competitive federalism, with healthy competition for development among States, the Prime Minister said.",
