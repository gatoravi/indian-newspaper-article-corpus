    "text": "The victory of the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) over the NDA in the last Bihar Assembly election has changed the national political discourse. With the Assembly by-election in Harlakhi constituency of Madhubani district scheduled for February 13, the NDA is looking for a chance to retain the seat and score over its rival, while the grand alliance is leaving no stone unturned to ensure its victory.\n\nThe seat fell vacant after Basant Kushwaha, who had won the poll as the candidate of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), one of the constituents of the NDA, died before he could take the oath as member of the newly constituted 16th Bihar Assembly.\n\nOnce again, the grand alliance has thrown its weight behind Mohd. Shabbir, while the NDA has nominated Kushwaha\u2019s son Ashok Kumar. After the crushing defeat in the Assembly poll, the NDA now has an opportunity in Harlakhi to redeem its prestige.",
