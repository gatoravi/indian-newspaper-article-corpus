The ports \u2014 Kandla, Mumbai, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Mormugao, Visakhapatnam, Cochin, Chennai, New Mangalore, Ennore, V.O. Chidambaranar, Paradip and Kolkata \u2014 have 264,000 acres of land around them. These ports handle 61 per cent of the cargo traff\n\nic. \u201cEach port will construct one smart city. We are trying to do this. Each city will be built on an expenditure of about Rs. 3,000-4,000 crore. These will be green smart cities,\u201d the Minister had said in February last year.\n\nThis assumes significance as the Mumbai Port Trust has around 753 hectares of land, valued at Rs. 46,000 crore.\n\nThe government has planned to build wider roads, advanced townships and special economic zones, along with ship-breaking and ship-building centres, as part of smart port cities.",
