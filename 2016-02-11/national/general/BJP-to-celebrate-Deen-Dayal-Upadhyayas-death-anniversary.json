    "text": "With BJP chief Amit Shah releasing a book on the late Jana Sangh ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and a BJP-related think-tank reciting Deen Dayal Kathas on his death anniversary on Thursday, there are distinct signs of the BJP seeking to project Upadhyaya as a \u201cpro-poor\u201d icon. The book on \u201cUpadhyaya and the youth\u201d is a collection of articles showcasing as a social welfarist the Jana Sangh leader who died in 1968.\n\n\u201cThe measure of economic development and economic policies can never be the person standing at the top of the hierarchy but the one standing at its bottom,\u201d the book says, citing Upadhyaya\u2019s economic vision.\n\nThe Narendra Modi government has been accused by political opponents of being \u201canti-poor\u201d since it came to power, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dubbing it \u201c suit boot ki sarkar \u201d.\n\nThe government had to go back on the land acquisition Bill mid-way as it was seen as \u201canti-farmer\u201d. After its defeat in agrarian Bihar, the saffron party has been trying to be seen as \u201cpro-farmer\u201d and \u201cpro-poor\u201d, particularly with Uttar Pradesh, another agrarian State with much poverty, going to the polls in 2017. Upadhyaya himself hailed from western U.P.\n\nThe Deen Dayal Research Institute is organising recitals of Deen Dayal Katha \u2014 tales of Deen Dayal in the capital.\n\nThe Modi government has been seeking to fete Upadhyaya ever since it came to power \u2014 be it through an event in his memory at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library months back on his birth anniversary or a documentary screened by Lok Sabha TV.\n\nBJP chief Amit Shah will release\n\na book on the\n\nlate Jana Sangh ideologue",
