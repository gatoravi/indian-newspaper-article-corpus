Famous performances range from Marilyn Monroe\u2019s sultry singing for President John F. Kennedy to a version performed by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover to celebrate one year on Mars.\n\nBoth sides in the court case generally agreed that the song was put to paper in 1893 by Patty Hill, a kindergarten instructor in Kentucky, with her sister Milfred, though some say the melody came earlier.\n\nSchoolchildren would sing the tune, which was initially entitled \u201cGood Morning to You\u201d. The dispute centred on who put the Happy Birthday to You lyrics to the melody.\n\nJessica Hill, another sister, published the lyrics in 1935 in a copyright that was bought decades later by Warner/Chappell, but the plaintiffs countered that the tune had already been widely in public use. The case is the latest high-profile dispute regarding song copyright.\n\nLast year, a judge controversially ordered Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke to pay more than $7 million to the family of Marvin Gaye for alleged similarities between their 2013 smash hit \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d and the late Motown legend's \u201cGot to Give It Up\u201d. \u2014 AFP",
