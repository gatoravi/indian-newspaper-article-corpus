This is an unexpected bonanza, and if a borewell is drilled here, we may get enough water to quench the thirst of Honna Kiranagi and surrounding villages,\u201d a beaming Mr. Haralayya said.\n\nA few meters away, on a kutcha road where bullock carts ply, two other springs were spotted. \u201cThis may be a potential spot for water. Geologists should be called to take a decision on drilling borewells here,\u201d said Shambulinga Doddamani, a Tilagol local.\n\nAt least two more springs appeared in the dried up Honna Kiranagi stream in the adjoining Saradagi village. It sprung from a bed of limestone slabs and soon a large pool of water had collected, and the livestock began to drink from it.\n\nMr. Haralayya said this phenomenon was surprising as all other sources, including the open well in Honna Kiranagi had dried up. Even drilling borewells up to 450 ft had not produced water.\n\nMr. Thippanna is now willing to donate a piece of his land to the government to drill a borewell near the Krishi Honda so that there will be drinking water for the village.\n\nAll he asks in return is for the government to drill a borewell for him in his field.",
