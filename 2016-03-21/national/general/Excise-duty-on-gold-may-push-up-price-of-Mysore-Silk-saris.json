We had bought gold zari worth Rs. 30 crore to Rs. 35 crore last year,\u201d KSIC Chairman D. Basavaraj told The Hindu .\n\nKSIC\u2019s Marketing Manager S. Philomen Raj said the gold lace used in Mysore Silk saris is procured from traders in Surat. \u201cWe have not yet heard about the revised price from the traders after the fresh imposition of central excise duty,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the gold zari used in saris manufactured at the KSIC factory in Mysuru contains 0.65 per cent pure gold, while the remainder is made of up of silver, silk, and copper.\n\nOf every 100 grams of gold zari used in the saris, Mr. Basavaraj said pure gold comprises 0.65 grams while silver constitutes 65 gm. The rest is copper and silk, he added.\n\nKSIC buys more than 100 kg of gold zari every year. Though the revised rate of zari has not been fixed post imposition of excise duty, Mr. Basavaraj estimated the cost of zari used by KSIC to go up by Rs. 35 lakh at the last year\u2019s price. \u201cWe will have no option, but to recover the increased cost from buyers,\u201d he said before adding that the rate will differ from sari to sari.",
