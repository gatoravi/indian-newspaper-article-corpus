    "text": "We are in touch with PDP legislators, says BJP MLA\n\nThe BJP on Sunday said it was in touch with several Peoples Democratic Party legislators who were in favour of government formation in Jammu and Kashmir, but added it would \u201cnever\u201d accept new conditions for alliance put forth by its president Mehbooba Mufti.\n\n\u201cSeveral PDP legislators who are in favour of government formation and who also don\u2019t want midterm polls are in touch with the BJP leadership,\u201d BJP legislator Ravinder Raina said.\n\nThe Nowshera MLA said the party would stick to the Agenda of Alliance agreed upon with the PDP a year ago, adding that any deviation would amount to disrespecting the late Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.\n\n\u201cI have come to know that she [Mehbooba] has put forth new conditions, but the BJP will never accept them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the BJP had \u201cseveral options\u201d to form a government, if the alliance with the PDP breaks down, but would disclose them \u201cwhen the time comes.\u201d\n\nThe need of the hour for both the alliance partners was to form a government based on mutual trust and respect the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir regions, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople of Jammu gave a thumping majority to the BJP while people of Kashmir voted for the PDP, hence it is time for both the parties to provide a democratically elected government to the people, as Governor\u2019s rule is no substitute to it,\u201d Mr. Raina said.\n\nAsked whether the BJP would encourage defection within the PDP, he said his party would do no such thing.\n\nMr. Raina said the BJP would not \u201csurrender\u201d its ideology and would follow its \u201cnationalistic policies,\u201d including in Jammu and Kashmir. \u2014 PTI",
