    "text": "While Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi blamed the BJP government at the Centre for the crisis in Uttarakhand, Union Finance minister Arun Jaitley said the Congress was responsible for its own troubles. \u201cThe Congress, be it in Bihar or West Bengal has lowered its sights to play second fiddle to other parties, and now blames the BJP when its own partymen turn against it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn March 12, senior Congress leader Ambika Soni, who oversees Uttarakhand as party general secretary, had a two hour meeting with Mr. Bahuguna. \u201cThe meeting ended on a positive note,\u201d said Kishore Upadhyay, Congress president in Uttarakhand. \u201cWe never thought he (Bahuguna) would stoop so low.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Ms. Soni had assured Mr. Bahuguna that one of the vacant ministerial berths would be filled according to his choice and the issue of ejecting the PDF ministers would be sorted once the assembly session is over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that he turned his back on those terms and betrayed us,\u201d said Mr. Kishore, who was present at the meeting.\n\nAccording to Mr Kishore, a week ago, the State leadership again spoke to Mr. Bahuguna and three other leaders, who later rebelled, to make sure there were no hard feelings among the party ranks.\n\n\u201cThey assured us that everything was fine,\u201d Mr. Kishore said. \u201cEven the day they created ruckus in the Assembly, three of them [rebels] had lunch with me. There was no sign of resentment on their face.\u201d\n\nSince the open rebellion and the floor test scheduled for March 28 that will decide the fate of the Harish Rawat government the party high command has decided to stay away from the crisis.\n\n\u201cI think Harish Rawat is very equipped to deal with this matter,\u201d said Ms. Soni. \u201cThe entire leadership supports him and we are very sure that he has a majority in the house.\u201d\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",
