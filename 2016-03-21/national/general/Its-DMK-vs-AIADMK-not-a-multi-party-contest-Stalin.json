    "text": "While Tamil Nadu is set to witness a multi-cornered contest in an Assembly election after 27 years, DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin, who undertook a State-wide tour recently, feels that the people would see only the DMK and the ruling AIADMK as serious contenders in the race.\n\n\u201cThe actual contest is between the DMK and the AIADMK,\u201d he told The Hindu in an exclusive interview and claimed that the multi-cornered competition was the creation of the ruling party. Mr. Stalin disagreed with the conception that a fragmented opposition would only facilitate a victory for the ruling party and insisted that the DMK will form the next government under Mr. Karunanidhi\u2019s leadership.\n\nMr. Stalin also denied that he had used the Namakku Naame road show to promote his personal identity. He made light of actor and DMDK founder Vijayakant\u2019s decision to reject an invitation from the DMK to forge an electoral alliance to take on the AIADMK in the coming polls.",
