    "text": "At a time when discussions go on between the Left Front and the Congress, \u201cunification of secular and democratic forces\u201d to oust the Trinamool Congress has become the main thrust of the Left Front\u2019s manifesto for the West Assembly Assembly elections. The manifesto urges the voters to cast their ballot to elect a \u201cLeft, democratic and secular government\u201d.\n\nThe manifesto was released by Left Front chairperson Biman Basu here on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Trinamool Congress has to be defeated to free the State from anarchy and misrule as well as to restore democracy. Defeating Trinamool is also necessary to weaken the BJP,\u201d the manifesto says.\n\nPointing out that the Trinamool had earlier joined forces with the BJP and shared power at the Centre, the document says, \u201cthe TMC helped the BJP in increasing its strength in Bengal.\u201d\n\nRegarding its plans for industrialisation, the manifesto says issues like \u201cland acquisition for industry has to be dealt with caution\u201d.\n\nThe Left Front promises to take a tough stand against communalism and extremism and to keep \u201can alert vigil over the safety of the Muslim and other minority communities.\u201d It further promises to \u201cstrictly follow the reservation norms\u201d. The manifesto promises to \u201cstop unwarranted political interference\u201d in state matters. This was one of the main allegations of the Opposition during the Left Front government.",
