    "text": "Days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Washington DC for the Nuclear Security Summit, a senior Japanese diplomat told The Hindu that India had committed to adhere to the \u201ccontrol of nuclear material, traceability [of nuclear fuel] and consequence in case of a nuclear accident\u201d under the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on civil nuclear cooperation with Japan signed during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to India in 2015.\n\nIntrusive, feel experts\n\nThough the bilateral agreement leaves out India\u2019s military nuclear programme, experts warn that the agreed principles impinge on India\u2019s independent nuclear programme as they imply intrusive inspection of civilian nuclear reactors as warranted under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nThe Japanese diplomat pointed out that so far, the world had to rely on India\u2019s verbal commitments on nuclear non-proliferation, but the India-Japan MoU marked the first occasion when India came under legal obligation to uphold non-proliferation concerns.\n\n\u201cThere were no tools to bind India, only India\u2019s voluntary self-claimed policy existed, but now there is legally binding measures by the agreement between India and Japan,\u201d said the diplomat, explaining that the commitments were proof of India\u2019s peaceful and transparent intentions in using nuclear reactors solely for energy generation. He said India will be financially accountable if it is found to be violating the principles.\n\nAn Indian official who has been associated with the negotiations said the principles being cited by the Japanese were nothing extraordinary and were part of the \u201cstandard template for civil nuclear deal\u201d that India had signed with several countries. However, he refused to address the Japanese assertion that India would have to financially compensate Japan if it violated the principles.\n\nTop experts on nuclear affairs, however, describe the MoU as a \u201cbackdoor attempt to draw India into the NPT\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe principles of traceability and control over nuclear material are highly intrusive measures that will be used by the Japanese to trace the nuclear fuel that Japanese-origin reactors sold to India will contain,\u201d says Ashok Parthasarathi, former Scientific Adviser to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The MoU may destabilise India\u2019s established nuclear deals with Russia and France as they too may demand similar commitments previously denied to them, he said.\n\nA. Gopalakrishnan, former Chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, points out that conditions on \u201ctraceability of nuclear fuel and safety of nuclear material\u201d do not figure in the deals India concluded with the U.S., France and Russia.\n\n\u201cThe government should not accept such intrusive provisions as these are demeaning for a country of India\u2019s stature,\u201d Dr. Gopalakrishnan told The Hindu . Refuting the government\u2019s claim on the \u201ctemplate of civil nuclear deal\u201d, he said: \u201cThe official template of nuclear deal did not contain provisions that might empower outside powers to carry out inspection to trace nuclear fuel in India.\u201d\n\nNuclear experts describe the MoU as a backdoor attempt to draw India into the NPT",
