    "text": "An organisation representing Sufis on Sunday asked the government to alleviate the \u201csense of fear\u201d among Muslims over riots and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rectify \u201chistorical blunders\u201d in India that brought in extremist ideologies threatening the community.\n\nThe All-India Ulama and Mashaikh Board (AIUMB) also urged governments worldwide to \u201crevive\u201d Sufism to combat terrorism. \u201cThere is a sense of fear among Muslims due to riots. The government should alleviate this fear, and the Union Home Ministry should spell out the steps taken in respect of all communal incidents and riots that have taken place so far in the country,\u201d the AIUMB said in a 25-point declaration released at a congregation on Ram Lila Maidan to mark the conclusion of the first World Sufi Forum.\n\nAddressing the congregation, AIUMB president Syed Mohammad Ashraf asked Mr. Modi to \u201crectify historic blunders\u201d and pay heed to the community\u2019s demands, including measures to tackle the trend of Sufism being replaced with extremist ideologies. He expressed concern that there were \u201cconcerted efforts\u201d to weaken Sufism in India and replace it with \u201cradical\u201d ideologies.\n\nHe said there was lack of representation for a majority of the Muslims in \u201ckey positions\u201d and urged the government to look into it.\n\nAsked about the \u201catmosphere of intolerance,\u201d Mr. Ashraf said: \u201cWe cannot determine the picture based on a few incidents. We should treat these as causes for alarm. We should try and ensure that our Ganga-Yamuna culture is not affected since there are signs that it is being weakened.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
