Krishna Shetty.\n\nThe State government has signed MoUs with corporate companies for adoption of tourism destinations, including the VAG.\n\nRecalling Tourism Minister R.V. Deshpande\u2019s decision against going back on the MoU, Mr. Shetty said that attempts by the forum, including representation made to Minister of State for Kannada and Culture Umashree failed to yield any result. \u201cTo draw the attention, we have opted for this artistic mode of black umbrella and whistling protest,\u201d he said.\n\nOn March 6, the forum came out in public for the first time and staged \u2018Occupy Venkatappa Art Gallery\u2019 protest, as part of which many of them sent out photographs of themselves hugging landmarks on the gallery premises.\n\nSome legal experts, who participated in the protest, even suggested to explore legal options to get the MoU nullified.\n\nConsidering the response for the black umbrella protest, the VAG Forum has decided to intensify the agitation to save the city\u2019s famous landmark. Artists\u2019 groups have started protesting in various cities across the State.\n\n\u201cAn online petition campaign has already commenced. Signatures collected will be submitted to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah,\u201d Surekha, coordinator VAG Forum, said.\n\nActor Tara, MLC, who had raised the issue in the Legislative Council, said she would raise the artists\u2019 concern in the budget session through a call-attention motion.",
