    "text": "NASA scientists associated with interplanetary space probe New Horizons have revealed the former \u201castronomer\u2019s planet\u201d and its \u201cintriguing system of small moons\u201d in a comprehensive set of papers describing results from last summer\u2019s Pluto system flyby.\n\n\u201cThese five detailed papers completely transform our view of Pluto \u2014 revealing the former \u2018astronomer\u2019s planet\u2019 to be a real world with diverse and active geology, exotic surface chemistry, a complex atmosphere, puzzling interaction with the Sun and an intriguing system of small moons,\u201d said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.\n\nAfter a 9.5-year, three-billion-mile journey \u2014 launching faster and travelling farther than any spacecraft to reach its primary target \u2014 New Horizons zipped by Pluto on July 14 last year.\n\nNew Horizons\u2019 seven science instruments collected about 50 gigabits of data on the spacecraft\u2019s digital recorders, most of it coming over nine busy days surrounding the encounter, NASA said in a statement.\n\nThe first close-up pictures revealed a large heart-shaped feature carved into Pluto\u2019s surface, telling scientists that this \u201cnew\u201d type of planetary world \u2014 the largest, brightest and first-explored in the mysterious, distant \u201cthird zone\u201d of our solar system known as the Kuiper Belt \u2014would be even more interesting and puzzling than models predicted.\n\n\u201cObserving Pluto and Charon up close has caused us to completely reassess thinking on what sort of geological activity can be sustained on isolated planetary bodies in this distant region of the solar system, worlds that formerly had been thought to be relics little changed since the Kuiper Belt\u2019s formation,\u201d said Jeff Moore, lead author of the geology paper on Pluto. \u2014 IANS\n\nThey have published results from last summer\u2019s Pluto system flyby",
