    "text": "Scientists have found a switch that triggers the \u2018power kick\u2019 sperms used to fertilise a human egg, uncovering a likely source of male infertility and a target for contraceptives that work in both men and women.\n\nThe switch is a protein receptor that responds to the female sex hormone progesterone, which is released by the egg or oocyte, the ultimate goal towards which sperms swim.\n\nThousands of these receptors sit on the surface of a sperm\u2019s tail and when the sperm gets close to the egg, the hormone activates the receptor and triggers a cascade of changes that make the tail snap like a whip, powering the sperm into and hopefully through the cells protecting the egg.\n\n\u201cIf the receptor protein doesn\u2019t recognise progesterone, you would be infertile,\u201d said Melissa Miller, a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThis gives us an understanding of another pathway that is involved in human sperm activity,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u2014 PTI",
