DiCaprio shared the picture of the \u201cwonderful gift\u201d on Instagram. \u201cThank you to the people of Yakutia for this wonderful gift, especially all of the women who gathered and donated the materials that went into creating the statue. As they wrote in their letter, Yakutia is home to the coldest inhabited place on Earth \u2014 and the region is extremely vulnerable to climate change.\n\n\u2014 PTI",
