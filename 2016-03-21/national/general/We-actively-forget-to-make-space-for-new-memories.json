    "text": "They say that once you have learned to ride a bicycle, you never forget how to do it. But discovery of a new brain mechanism suggests that while learning, the brain also actively tries to forget apparently to make space for new memories to form.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that a pathway in the brain has been linked to forgetting, to actively erasing memories,\u201d said Cornelius Gross, one of the researchers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory who was part of the study.\n\n\u201cOne explanation for this is that there is limited space in the brain, so when you are learning, you have to weaken some connections to make room for others,\u201d Gross said, adding: \u201cTo learn new things, you have to forget things you have learned before.\u201d \u2014 IANS",
