Hafiz Saeed was there, Dawood Ibrahim was there. All the terrorist training centres are there, and someone\u2019s bullet or bomb might have killed him,\u201d Dr. Sabnis had said.\n\nThis ambivalent statement is being interpreted by Mr. Modi\u2019s supporters as something that was in bad taste.\n\n\u2018I praised him\u2019\n\n\u201cI want to clarify that while I did condemn Mr. Modi for the 2002 riots, I was praising him for his courageous trip to Pakistan,\u201d Dr. Sabnis said later.\n\nThe author said he would speak to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.\n\nPolice say\n\nShripal Sabnis was threatened after he criticised\n\nNarendra Modi",
