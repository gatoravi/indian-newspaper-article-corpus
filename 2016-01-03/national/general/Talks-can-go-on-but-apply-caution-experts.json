Gen. (Retd.) Syed Ata Hasnain tweeted: \u201cPathankot terrorist attack will place more pressure on Nawaz Sharif than Narendra Modi. I wrote on December 25 about the challenge of contingencies in India-Pak. peace process. That is the first thing on agenda before even agreeing to talk.\u201d Several commentators told The Hindu that the initiative to begin talks with Pakistan seems to be facing opposition from anti-India elements deep inside the Pakistan establishment.\n\nComing down on the perceived softness on Pakistan following the December 25 Modi-Sharif meeting, Brig. (Retired) Gurmeet Kanwal said talks between India and Pakistan must not compromise India\u2019s ability to punish Pakistani military and the militant groups for terror strikes on Indian soil. \u201cIndia must follow a two-track dialogue with Pakistan which will give India the freedom to retaliate suitably when Pakistan fails to prevent attacks by terror groups that enjoy support of the Pakistan military,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer External Affairs Minister K. Natwar Singh said that the terror strike has put a question mark on the entire peace initiative. \u201cThe terror attack which has come within days of the Lahore meeting \u2026 shows that Mr. Sharif does not have total control over the violent elements on the Pakistani side,\u201d Mr. Singh said.",
