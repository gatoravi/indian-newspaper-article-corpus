Passengers may choose meal or food items offered by the SHGs and place the order. This will help in sustainable development of SHGs, a senior official said.\n\n\u201cThe proposed association is part of our plan to empower women,\u201d said IRCTC Chairman and Managing Director A.K. Manocha.\n\n\u201cThe initiative aims to develop local communities and ensure all-inclusive growth.\u201d Mr. Manocha said. India has no less than one crore SHGs, mostly functioning in rural and semi-urban areas with 10 to 20 members (majority women) per group.\n\n\u201cWe plan to collaborate with some of them which are into making food items. The finer points will evolve in the weeks to come,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, IRCTC provides e-catering facility in all the trains passing through the most important 45 stations of Indian Railways. It also provides food to 1,516 trains without pantry cars. The food is directly delivered by the vendor on the berth/seat of the passenger.\n\nIn its e-catering service which facilitates supply of food on ordering two hours before boarding the train, IRCTC is already in a collaboration with Foodpanda, KFC, Domino\u2019s, TFS, Street Foods, Wimpy, Jan Aahar, Mio Amore, Alibaba, Cafe Lite, Hello Curry and Ratna Cafe besides IRCTC Food Plaza and IRCTC Fast Food Units. \u2014 PTI",
