Mummers showed off their bright costumes on Friday at the city\u2019s annual New Year's Day parade, a colourful celebration that features string bands, comic brigades and elaborate floats. The Mummers Parade, which sought to embrace diversity this year, is thought to be the oldest folk parade in the country. Mummery, which comes from the French word \u2018momerie\u2019 and means ridiculous ceremony in fancy dress, first arrived in Philadelphia in the 17th century when immigrant groups gathered informally to celebrate their traditions.\u2014 Photo: AP",
