It was from Mr. Verma\u2019s phone that one of the terrorists reportedly made a call to his mother at Bahawalpur in Pakistan. This call, intercepted by the agencies, gave the first clue of a terrorist attack planned for the State.\n\nDuring the phone call, the alleged terrorist is heard telling his mother in a Punjabi accent: \u201cMain kuch bada kaam karne aaya hoon, jispe aapko fakr hoga [I have come for a great work and you will be proud of me].\u201d When the woman asks him when did he go to India, he replied: \u201cKal raat daakhil hue [We entered yesterday night].\u201d\n\nThis call established that the attackers could have entered India in the intervening night of December 30-31 as the call was made in the early hours of Friday.\n\nA top intelligence officer told The Hindu that the possibility that the group belonged to the JeM was only on the basis of a handwritten note recovered from Mr. Singh\u2019s vehicle, which the terrorists had used. The Hindu has a copy of the note.\n\nThe note written in English and signed by \u201cA.G.S\u201d, dated December 25, 2015, says the group had planned attacks to avenge the death of Afzal Guru, the 2001 Parliament attack convict, who was hanged to death in 2013. The officer said that till now, they had not been able to make any recoveries from the Pathankot airbase, where the operation took place for 13 hours and continued till late in the evening on Saturday.\n\nThe officer said that so far they had not received any information on Pakistan\u2019s complicity. He said the airbase had been cordoned off and would be opened up for investigations and recoveries on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBy afternoon, we were sure that terrorists had sneaked into Punjab and a high alert was sounded. The NSA had taken control of the situation. We are treating this as a minor victory of sorts as a major attack has been thwarted,\u201d said the top intelligence officer.\n\nIt was from Verma\u2019s phone that one of the terrorists reportedly made a call to his mother in Pakistan",
