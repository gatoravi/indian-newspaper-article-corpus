They were produced before a district court in Howrah which remanded them in 14 days\u2019 judicial custody.\n\nLast Sunday, a minor girl who boarded a Punjab-bound train had mistakenly got into a compartment that was reserved for Army personnel. After the Jharkhand Police rescued her from Madhupur , they arrested an Army jawan and handed him over to the Bengal GRP.\n\n\u201cDuring questioning, the girl told us that there were two more jawans in the compartment and so to trace them we showed her the video footage of the compartment from where she identified the two other jawans,\u201d a senior official of the GRP told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe CISF at the Airport was given photographs of the two and after our team reached there, they were arrested and brought back to Howrah,\u201d said the GRP official.",
