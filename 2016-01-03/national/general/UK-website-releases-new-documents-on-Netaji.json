    "text": "A United Kingdom-based website, set up to chart the last days of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, has released new documents to dismiss the claims that he may have been spotted in China years after his death in a plane crash.\n\nThe website \u2014 www.bosefiles.info \u2014 has reproduced a telegram from the Indian Embassy in Beijing, contradicting claims in India about the nationalist leader being in the Chinese capital in 1952.\n\nBose was reported dead in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945. But in 1955, S.M. Goswami, an ardent admirer of Bose, published a pamphlet in India with the heading \u2018Netaji Mystery Revealed.\u2019\n\nIt carried a picture of Chinese officials with a Mongolian trade delegation said to have been taken in 1952. Goswami said one of the persons in the photograph was Bose. Appearing as a witness before the 1956 Netaji Inquiry Committee, he presented the photo as evidence of Bose being alive.\n\nThe committee sent the exhibit to the Indian Embassy in Beijing for identification.\n\nThe Embassy forwarded it to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The Embassy cabled India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs: \u201cConcerning alleged photograph of SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE: We showed this to Foreign Office who have informed us that the photograph is of LEE KE HUNG, Medical Superintendent of PUMC [Peking University Medical College].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe telegram exposes one of countless attempts over 70 years to spread disinformation about Subhas Bose,\u201d says Ashis Ray, a London-based journalist who has set up the website. \u2014 PTI",
