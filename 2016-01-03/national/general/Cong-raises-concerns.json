    "text": "Will Prime Minister take up the issue with Pakistan, asks Congress\n\nThe Congress raised concerns over the fact that two successive terror attacks, including the one on Saturday in Pathankot seemed centred in the sensitive border State of Punjab. Senior party leader Ahmad Patel, however, said \u201cwe must all fight terror together,\u201d while reacting to the Pathankot attack. Party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said this was a cause for concern and demanded to know what Prime Minister Narendra Modi intended to do about it.\n\n\u201cWhy have there been two terror attacks in Punjab, a State that has not seen any terror activities in over 20 years. Even the third attack in Udhampur [in J&K] was on the border of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d Mr. Surjewala said.\n\nThe Shiv Sena said the government should give a befitting reply to the perpetrators of the attack and raised the Punjab angle. Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said, \u201cThese terrorists must be answered in their own language. But the way after Kashmir, Punjab is being targeted, is a matter for concern.\u201d",
