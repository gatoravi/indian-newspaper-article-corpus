I am reasonably optimistic as far as the next session is concerned that we will be able to push it [GST Bill],\u201d Mr. Jaitley said, as the strength of parliamentarians belonging to the Congress and its allies would start to diminish.\n\nThe GST is expected to boost economic growth by one to two per cent as it will replace India\u2019s complex indirect tax regime of multiple state and central levies that makes inter-State trade and movement of goods tedious. The new tax regime should have been introduced much earlier, says Mr. Jaitley.\n\nThe government had announced a target date of April 2016 for the rollout of the GST regime, but is now eyeing a start in the middle of financial year 2016-17. The Finance Minister said he would be continuing his talks with the States and all the political parties to ensure the passage of the Bill.\n\nAfter the Constitution Amendment Bill is passed in Parliament, there are three more legislation \u2014 Central GST (CGST), State GST (SGST) and Integrated GST (IGST) \u2014 that need to be passed for the GST regime to come into force.\n\n\u201cWe are in the stage of readiness as far as those legislation are concerned which will have to be passed then by the Central government and by the State governments,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me 4-5 years later, in Income Tax Act ... did the provisions of the retrospective taxation help India or did they hurt India? My answer is very clear, they hurt India because at the end of the day we have not been able to collect those taxes and we scared investors away,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said, addressing officer-trainees of the Indian Revenue Service.\n\nThe Minister told revenue officials to make taxation a painless process for people. \u201cWhen in doubt, go straight. You\u2019ll never go wrong. The moment you deviate by even a few inches, there is no limit to which you can fall. There is no such thing as 99 per cent integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you lean either way then you will unfairly cost the revenue or you may be unfairly taxing an assessee. \u201d\n\nThe introduction of GST is expected to boost economic growth by 1 per cent to 2 per cent as it would replace India\u2019s complex indirect tax regime of multiple state and central level levies that makes inter-state trade and movement of goods tedious.\n\nArun Jaitley Finance Minister\n\nI am reasonably optimistic as far as the next session is concerned that we will be able to push it, Jaitely says\n\nThe new tax regime will lead to the economic integration of India",
