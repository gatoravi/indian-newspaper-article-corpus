The TDB was for providing basic pilgrim facilities there in an eco-friendly manner. However, frequent intervention and intimidation by the Forest Department have been posing hurdles in the temple administration\u2019s efforts to ensure proper pilgrim facilities at Sabarimala, he said.\n\nHe said the board had only 25 hectares of land, allotted by the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, in its possession at Sabarimala. He added that a TDB team would invite Mr. Modi to visit Sabarimala at the earliest.\n\nPAC recommendation\n\nMr. Tharayil said the PAC visited Sabarimala in 2004 and 2005 to collect first-hand information regarding the problems faced by the pilgrim centre.\n\nChapter II of one of the reports submitted by the PAC had discussed the problems facing the pilgrims on account of the inclusion of Sabarimala in the PTR.\n\nThe report had categorically stated that delinking Sabarimala from the PTR was the only remedial measure to address the plight of the pilgrims.",
