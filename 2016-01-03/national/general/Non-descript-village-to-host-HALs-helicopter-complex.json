(HAL) has planned to start its composite Rs. 4,000-crore helicopter complex.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stopping over briefly from Mysuru (after inaugurating the annual Indian Science Congress) to lay the foundation stone for the 600-acre facility. The HAL says the full facility, including a helipad, should be ready by around 2019.\n\nInitially, the HAL plans to manufacture the lighter, three-tonne machines \u2014 the Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) for reconnaissance and surveillance; and then the attack helicopter LCH (Light Combat Helicopter). It will overhaul and repair military helicopters.\n\n\u201cThe facility will boost [HAL\u2019s] aviation capability in the helicopter segment as it will produce three-tonne to ten-tonne class of helicopters,\u201d HAL Chairman T. Suvarna Raju told The Hindu . \u201cLater, it could take up the 10-12-tonne class into which we are yet to venture.\u201d The HAL earlier explored the production modalities of this class tentatively.\n\nCurrently, the Bengaluru Helicopter Division produces the indigenous 5.5-tonne ALH Dhruv for civil and military agencies; the older Cheetah, the Lancer and also the re-engined Cheetal choppers. Repair and overhaul of the forces\u2019 rotary fleet are also done here. When the Tumakuru complex gets going, the Bengaluru facility, along with the Rotary Wing Research & Design Centre, would remain busy with next levels of helicopter R&D and design, Mr. Raju said.",
