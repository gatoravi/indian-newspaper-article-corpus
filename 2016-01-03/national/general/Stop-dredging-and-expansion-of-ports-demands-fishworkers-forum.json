In order to make way for inland waterways, deep dredging will be conducted on all these rivers. Dredging have not been conducted for several years. Consequently, it would be an unsustainable exercise and sudden dredging would led to collapse of the river beds may cause water-logging areas surrounding the river, besides completely destroying corals, sea weeds and other marine ecology, collapse of mangroves, etc.\u201d, apprehended Mr. Simoes.\n\nHe recalled expert Dr. Antonio Mascarenhas of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) had warned the Goa Government against deep dredging proposed by Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) , which would aggravate sand erosion would cause drastic morphological changes within the estuary. Mr. Simoes further pointed out that of the 7,516.6 km coastline in the country, 42 per cent has already been washed away, dredging of 111 rivers, expansion ports and jetties would only further intensify erosion of the coast due to Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations.\n\n\u201cAbout 20 per cent of the 105 km of Goa\u2019s coastline has already been affected by erosion. Heavy sand mining, constructions along the coast etc., are some of the reason of such destructions. We fear a Chennai flood like situation with this unsustainable dredging\u201d, warned the Fisherfolk\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u2018Govt. projects are feared to destroy the existing marine ecology lock,\n\nstock and barrel\u2019",
