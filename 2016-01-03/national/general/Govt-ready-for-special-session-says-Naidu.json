Venkaiah Naidu said.\n\nObstructive techniques\n\n\u201cWe were keen to pass the Bill last year itself,\u201d Mr. Naidu told reporters on Saturday. \u201cThe Bill is stuck in the Rajya Sabha due to obstructive techniques adopted by the Congress. They are obstructing the Bill thinking that the credit for passing it will go to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. From day one, the government is willing to walk the extra mile to take the opposition on board to unleash the positive energies necessary for building a new resurgent India,\u201d he said.\n\nMaking a fervent appeal to the Congress, he said the Opposition could take the government to task for omissions and commissions, if any. But stalling Parliament and legislation for political ends would have a huge impact on people and the economic progress of the country.\n\nHe said the Bill\u2019s passage would make a substantial difference to the manner in which business was conducted in the country.",
