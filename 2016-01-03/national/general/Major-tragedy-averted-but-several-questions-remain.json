    "text": "In the attack on the Pathankot Air Force station, one of India\u2019s key airbases on the Western border, the air assets stationed there was miraculously saved as security forces quickly sealed off the area.\n\nThe MiG-21 BiS fighter jets and the Mi-25 and Mi-35 attack helicopters were in the technical area which was swiftly sealed off. The attack is another in a string of hits on security installations.\n\n\u201cThe infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, preventing them from entering the technical zone where high-value assets are parked,\u201d the Indian Air Force said in a statement.\n\nAnalysts say lives were lost because the terrorists were at large in a civilian area, increasing the risk of collateral damage, requiring caution by the forces. \u201cThey are in the domestic area; you can\u2019t just shoot them away. There are civilians and families,\u201d an officer said.\n\nHowever, it is still surprising that even with specialist forces such as the National Security Guards (NSG) and the Garuds (Air Force Special Forces), along with others, it took close to 13 hours to neutralise all the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWhen someone approaches the base, you cannot shoot on suspicion. Someone might have a hidden weapon and fire randomly,\u201d a retired senior Air Force officer said.\n\nThe IAF said intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to \u201cinfiltrate into the military installation in the Pathankot area\u201d. \u201cDue to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies, a group of terrorists was detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as it entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot,\u201d a statement said.",
