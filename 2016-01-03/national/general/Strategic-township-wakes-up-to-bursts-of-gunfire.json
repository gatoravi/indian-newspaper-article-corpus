    "text": "This strategic township, where Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir meet, woke up unusually early on Saturday.\n\nA sudden burst of gunfire that emanated from the Air Force base around 3.30 a.m. would fully die out only by evening.\n\nShreyas, who stays in Dhaka Chowk adjacent to the spot of the terror attack, said he woke up to the sound of gunshots and reached the spot at 5 a.m. \u201cAll I could see was barricading and heavy presence of troops as firing continued.\u201d\n\nThe 15-hour operation ended around 7 p.m. with security forces neutralising the Pakistani terrorists who attacked the IAF base in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nLate into the evening, there was no clarity about the final casualties on the IAF side.\n\nOfficials insisted that only three have died.\n\nArmy teams leaving the Air Force area confirmed that all the terrorists were dead but as per latest reports, the body of the fifth terrorist, who engaged a joint team of IAF, Army, NSG and SWAT commandoes of the Punjab Police, had not been found till 7.45 p.m.\n\nThis, nearly two hours after local people heard the last gunshot and 20 minutes after the IAF choppers and aircraft monitoring the whole operation aerially had been grounded.\n\nThe police are now piecing together the sequence of events from Superintendent of Police Salvinder Singh\u2019s abduction to his release and the attacks within hours after the earlier incident. It is suspected that the attackers used the forest side to enter the high-security premise.",
