According to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Survivors in Israel, 1,80,000 of them live in the Jewish state.\n\nMurray Greenfield, founder of Gefen Publishing, which specialises in works about Judaism and its history, said he would not publish it \u201ceven if they paid me\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy wife is a Holocaust survivor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a built-in censorship on this book, in spite of being very much against censorship (generally).\u201d\n\nIn many countries, including some of Israel\u2019s Arab neighbours, copies of the book are widely available. It can also be found on the Internet.\n\n\u201cThe book is available online,\u201d Dan Michman, head of the Yad Vashem International Institute for Holocaust Research, said. \u201cMany copies are to be found. Some 12 million copies were printed in German; so it is not rare.\u201d\n\nThe book is also available in a shortened version in Hebrew in Israeli universities, the result of a campaign in the late 1980s by Holocaust survivor Dan Yaron.\n\nYaron, who died in 1999, fought for the book, totally forbidden until then, to be published in Hebrew for educational purposes.\n\n\u201cHe said it was important for the people to know and to prevent future such events by reading what the [Nazi] leader was saying,\u201d Mr. Michman said. Yaron, he added, approached him to publish it, but there was no money at the time.\n\nIn the end, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem financed the project, and a condensed version of the rambling 720-page original is available in Israeli universities and research institutes. Mr. Michman was involved in drafting the 3,500 explanatory notes for the annotated German reprint, expected out in the coming days, and the book will remain outlawed if it is not contextualised. He said it was positive to put the book in a wider context. \u201cIt will include a lot of issues around the text \u2014 where Hitler took his ideas from [and] when he suggests something it explains if and how it was translated into deeds.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
