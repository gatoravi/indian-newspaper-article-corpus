They only have to follow through on that commitment now, officials said.\n\nThey believe that much would depend on which way the evidence leads, and whether there was a direct link between the attackers to Pakistani intelligence, and whether the newly formed NSA mechanism could be used to track the perpetrators.\n\nIn its official statement condemning the \u201cterrorist attack\u201d, Pakistan too made it clear that it understands Pathankot operations would have a bearing on talks between the two countries, noting that it wished to \u201cbuild on the goodwill created by the high-level contacts between the two countries.\u201d Pakistan also said it was committed to \u201cpartner with India\u201d to \u201ccompletely eradicate the menace of terrorism\u201d. Such a statement, calling it a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d, is rare.\n\nWill Mr. Modi\u2019s latest peace pitch to Pakistan and statement on not allowing the \u201cenemies of humanity to succeed\u201d mean talks between the Foreign Secretaries who are due to meet in Islamabad in mid-January, are still on track? \u201cThis process cannot be destroyed due to one attack,\u201d Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said.",
