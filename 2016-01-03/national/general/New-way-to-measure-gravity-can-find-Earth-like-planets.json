    "text": "In a bid to determine whether distant stars with planets orbiting them can harbour life, a global team of astronomers has discovered a new way to measure the pull of gravity at the surface of distant stars. Knowing the surface gravity of a star is essentially knowing how much you would weigh on that star.\n\nIf stars had solid surfaces on which you could stand, then your weight would change from star to star.\n\nThe new method allows scientists to measure surface gravity with an accuracy of about four per cent, for stars too distant and too faint to apply current techniques.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know the star, you don\u2019t know the planet. The size of an exoplanet is measured relative to the size of its parent star,\u201d said study co-author and professor Jaymie Matthews from University of British Columbia.\n\nIf you find a planet around a star that you think is Sun-like but is actually a giant, you may have fooled yourself into thinking you\u2019ve found a habitable Earth-sized world.\n\n\u201cOur technique can tell you how big and bright is the star, and if a planet around it is the right size and temperature to have water oceans, and maybe life,\u201d Matthews added.\n\nThe new technique called the \u201cautocorrelation function timescale technique\u201d or timescale technique for short, uses subtle variations in the brightness of distant stars recorded by satellites like Canada\u2019s MOST and NASA\u2019s Kepler missions. \u2014 IANS",
