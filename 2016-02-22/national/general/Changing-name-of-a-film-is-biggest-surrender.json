It\u2019s a satire on the contemporary social milieu of Kerala. It makes an effort to map how our society views sex, privacy and women. It will be narrated through 10 scenes, or rather 10 events,\u201d said the young director.\n\nOn the possibility of the title inviting criticism, he said \u2018the biggest surrender a film-maker could make is to change a title fearing backlash and criticism.\u2019\n\n\u2018No vicious intention\u2019\n\n\u201cI have no vicious intentions or plans to gain mileage out of this title. As a film-maker, I enjoy the freedom to give an apt title for the movie. Many women have the name Durga and I should not have fear about giving this title,\u201d he said.\n\nRajasri Deshpande of Angry Indian Goddesses fame plays the title role in the movie. Made under the banner of Niv Art Movies, Sexy Durga will be shot in Perumbavur and Thiruvananthapuram in a single schedule. The shooting will begin in March.\n\nSexy Durga, the director\u2019s title for his next movie,\n\nhas raised eyebrows",
