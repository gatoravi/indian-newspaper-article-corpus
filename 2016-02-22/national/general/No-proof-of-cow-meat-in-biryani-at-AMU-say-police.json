Ravindra Gaur said.\n\nThe row broke out after right-wing activists alleged that \u2018beef biryani\u2019 was being served at the AMU Medical College canteen, an allegation promptly denied by the university.\n\nDemonstration held\n\nBJP Mayor Shakuntala Bharti, along with party leaders and several right-wing activists, held a demonstration outside the office of Senior Superintendent of Police, demanding registration of an FIR against the contractor of the medical college canteen for serving \u2018beef.\u2019\n\nA university spokesman clarified that it was common practice in India and abroad to refer to buffalo meat also as beef.\n\nIn fact cow meat had been banned in this institution more than a century back by its founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, keeping in view religious sensitivities, he said.\n\nAMU Vice Chancellor, Lt. Gen. (Rtd.) Zameer Uddin Shah, on Sunday said he was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d over the entire episode and the fact the city Mayor had taken up this issue with the police.\n\n\u201cI wish to point out that there is no truth whatsoever in the entire allegation that cow meat is being served anywhere on the AMU campus. This is entirely an attempt to whip up communal tension on a very lame excuse,\u201d Mr. Shah said.\n\n\u201cWe, at AMU, are deeply aware of the sentiments involved in such sensitive issues and there is no question of permitting anybody for violating the law on this matter,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI\n\nRight-wing activists alleged that \u2018beef biryani\u2019 was being served at the college canteen",
