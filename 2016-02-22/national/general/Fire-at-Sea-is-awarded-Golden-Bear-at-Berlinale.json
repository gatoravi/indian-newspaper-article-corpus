Mr. Rosi, who spent several months on Italy\u2019s Lampedusa making the film, dedicated the prize to its residents \u201cwho open their hearts to other peoples\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope to bring awareness,\u201d he said as he accepted the trophy from Ms. Streep.\n\n\u201cIt is not acceptable that people die crossing the sea trying to escape from tragedies.\u201d\n\nThe picture is told through the eyes of a 12-year-old local boy, Samuele Pucillo, and a doctor, Pietro Bartolo, who has been tending to the dehydrated, malnourished and traumatised new arrivals for a quarter-century.\n\nThree-time Oscar-winner Streep said her seven-member jury was \u201cswept away\u201d by Fire at Sea which she called \u201curgent, imaginative and necessary filmmaking\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt's a daring hybrid of captured footage and deliberate storytelling that allows us to consider what documentary can do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt demands its place in front of our eyes and compels our engagement and action.\u201d\n\nIn other prizes, France\u2019s Mia Hansen-Love won the Silver Bear for best director for her drama Things to Come . Tunisia\u2019s Majd Mastoura won the Silver Bear for best actor for his role in Hedi , a love story set in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, which also won best debut feature.\n\nThe Silver Bear for best actress went to Denmark\u2019s Trine Dyrholm for her role as a wronged wife in Thomas Vinterberg's The Commune , a semi-autobiographical take on his 1970s childhood.\n\nGrand Jury Prize\n\nOscar-winning Bosnian director Danis Tanovic took the runner-up Grand Jury Prize among 18 contenders for Death in Sarajevo about the corrosive legacy of the 1990s Balkan wars.\n\nA more than eight-hour-long historical epic by Filipino director Lav Diaz, A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery , claimed the Alfred Bauer Prize for a feature film that opens new perspectives in cinema.\n\nBest screenplay went to Polish filmmaker Tomasz Wasilewski, his portrait of the pivotal 1989-90 period in his country as told by four women, played by some of Poland's best-known theatre actresses, at crossroads in their lives. \u2014 AFP",
