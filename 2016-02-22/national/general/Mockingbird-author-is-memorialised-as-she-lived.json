She may have written a book that has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide since its publication in 1960, but there were no television news trucks and no police officers outside the church as her coffin, adorned with a spray of red and white roses, was wheeled into the church.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to be buried before anyone knew she was dead, and we\u2019re getting as close to it as possible,\u201d said George Landegger, an industrialist and philanthropist, who attended the service.\n\nIn addition to the private memorial service, the church opened in the afternoon to allow people to offer their sympathies and best wishes to Lee\u2019s extended family and her lawyer, Tonja B. Carter.\n\nUntil she died in her sleep early on Friday, at age 89, Lee had lived at the Meadows, an assisted living facility here. She was to be buried at Pineville Cemetery near the church, next to her father, Amasa Coleman Lee, who was the role model for her fictional character Atticus Finch, and near the graves of her mother, Frances, and her sister Alice.\n\nLee, known here as Nelle, was a Methodist, and Alice Lee held a number of prominent positions with the church and was also its lawyer.\n\nHarper Lee was a different story, recalled the Rev. Thomas Butts, who was pastor from 1993 to 1998.\n\n\u201cShe did not want to do anything that put her in the public eye,\u201d he said, although she attended church regularly, typically sitting in the fourth or fifth pew with her sister.\n\nLee was the most celebrated resident in town, private but not a recluse, and was often seen out at the restaurants with her sister. But she kept an apartment in New York, even after she moved back to the town where she had grown up.\n\n\u201cNelle loved New York,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cShe could keep her privacy intact in New York; she could hide in the open. You see, living in Monroeville is like living in a fishbowl.\u201d\n\nHer impact on Monroeville was evident everywhere, from the mockingbirds that adorn some buildings in the town square to the black funereal bows placed on the doors of the old courthouse, now a museum, where Lee set the scenes for her novel about a lawyer\u2019s fight for justice and tolerance.\n\nOutside the old courthouse on Saturday, Jared Anton, a lawyer from Florida, said the character of Atticus Finch had partly inspired his choice of profession, but he said he was disappointed at how reticent some people in town were to talk about Lee, even after her death.\n\n\u201cI have no problem if the lady wants a private funeral,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the impact of this book goes far beyond Monroeville or Monroe County.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear who among Lee\u2019s relatives and friends gave testimonials. But one speaker was Wayne Flynt, a friend of Lee\u2019s and professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, who said before the service that Lee had asked him to speak some 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want me to talk about her, she wanted me to talk about her art,\u201d he said. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
