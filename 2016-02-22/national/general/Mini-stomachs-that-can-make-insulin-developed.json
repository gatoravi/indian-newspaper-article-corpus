This tissue appears to be the best starting material,\u201d said Qiao Zhou of Harvard University.\n\nThe pylorus region connects the stomach to the small intestine. Cells in this area were the most responsive to high glucose levels, producing insulin to normalise mice\u2019s blood sugar.\n\nResearchers destroyed the mice\u2019s pancreatic beta cells, forcing them to rely on the altered stomach cells. Control animals, without tissue reprogramming, died within eight weeks. However, the experimental mice\u2019s reprogrammed cells maintained insulin and glucose levels in their blood for as long as the animals were tracked, up to six months. \u2014 PTI",
