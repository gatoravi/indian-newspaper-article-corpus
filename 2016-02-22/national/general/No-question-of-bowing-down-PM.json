    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a rally of farmers here on Sunday that NGOs upset with him for seeking accountability and the corrupt unable to continue with their fraudulent activities were trying to destabilise the NDA government. But he would not yield to them.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear that you have elected me to save the country from these vices. I won\u2019t deviate from the target you have set for me. I am not going to stop or get tired. There is no question of bowing down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know why they are rattled. But we will not let the country bow down and get destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Modi said the urea lobby, especially the chemical industry, was angry when he eliminated the scope for black marketing.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, many Chief Ministers used to write letters on the scarcity of urea for farmers. Some even sent letters quite frequently. But in 2015, I did not get any letter from any Chief Minister on the issue. My government decided to supply neem-coated urea which became unusable for chemical units. Thus, hoarding and black marketing has stopped,\u201d he said.",
