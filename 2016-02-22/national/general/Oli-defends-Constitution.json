    "text": "Visiting Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli on Sunday described his country\u2019s Constitution as \u201cinstitutionalised democratic struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is discrimination in the Nepali Constitution? The Constitution was drafted after consulting all sections of the Nepali people like the Tharus, the Madhesis, and the Janajatis, and does not discriminate against anyone in Nepal,\u201d Mr. Oli said at a press conference in Delhi.\n\nMr. Oli\u2019s comments are significant as it marks a hardening of Nepal\u2019s position, just a day after Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar spoke of Nepal\u2019s \u201cassurances\u201d on making the Constitution more inclusive.\n\nFollowing Mr Oli\u2019s comments, leaders of the United Madhesi Democratic Front (UMDF) told The Hindu that they too would harden their position and revive the protest against the government. \u201cMadhesi people are upset and we shall soon be back with protests on the streets and blockade on the border, as that is the only way to convince the Nepali government of our demands,\u201d said Upendra Yadav of UMDF.\n\nBut on Sunday, Mr Oli argued that Madhesis do not have a solid basis for reverting to the blockade which froze Nepali economy and hit India-Nepal ties.\n\n\u201cWe will ask about the reasons for the unhappiness if anyone wants to reinforce the blockade on Nepal-India border, as the Constitution can address all issues,\u201d Mr. Oli said.\n\nMr. Oli\u2019s colleague and Deputy Prime Minister Kamal Thapa said the government of Nepal was in touch with the Madhesis, but could not clarify the reasons for the trust deficit between the two sides.\n\n\u201cAnother blockade will not be in anyone\u2019s interest. I personally briefed the Madhesi leaders before arriving in Delhi and they seemed to be satisfied with our position. So the latest threats appear like public posturing to me,\u201d Mr Thapa told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Oli acknowledged that \u201csome misunderstanding\u201d had appeared between India and Nepal after the promulgation of the Nepali Constitution on September 20, 2015. But the Constitution was drafted through an open consultative process, he said. \u201cRounds of discussion took place before the draft of the Constitution was finalised. We did not bring the Constitution under the cover of the night,\u201d Mr. Oli said.\n\nHe assured the Madhesi that agitation would not be allowed to spiral out of control into a violent secessionist movement like the Tamil agitation of Sri Lanka.",
