It crossed the busy ITO intersection before arriving at Jantar Mantar, where the leaders addressed the gathering. The march resulted in massive traffic jams on the way, at ITO in particular, for at least two hours. However diversion of traffic minimised the impact.\n\nA lot of the slogans raised called for death to the JNU students who allegedly shouted pro-Pakistan slogans. Devesh Sharma, a retired serviceman, said he decided to attend the march to express \u201canguish\u201d against \u201canti-national activities\u201d taking place at JNU. Most protesters, however, said they were not associated with any political party.\n\n\u201cThe incident at JNU was the not the handiwork of a few students. Foreign funding helped organise the event,\u201d said another retired Army officer.",
