Stalin on Sunday said necessary steps would be taken to set up a Lok Ayukta (anti-corruption body) and to enact the Right to Service Act, if his party was elected to power in the Assembly polls.\n\nAddressing a public meeting near here, Mr. Stalin said, \u201cif the Lok Ayukta is established, there won't be any corruption or commission or collection (in government)\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would make the State number one in the country. Youth and students would be our priority,\u201d he said, adding the party would introduce prohibition in the State.\n\nMr. Stalin, who recently completed his Namakku Naame road show in all 234 Assembly constituencies, said the people had innumerable grievances. \u201cChief Minister Jayalalithaa had said she would need 36 days to list out the achievements of 36 departments, but it would take several years to list out the grievances people have,\u201d he said. Tearing into the ruling party for not fulfilling several promises made in the election manifesto, he alleged 50 of the 53 promises made were not fulfilled. He questioned the status of the satellite town project in Tirumazhisai, the desalination projects in Pattipulam and Nemmeli. On the other hand, companies such as Foxconn and Nokia had wound up their Chennai operations.",
