I have faith in my father\u2019s decision\u2026 but I will safeguard the interests of J&K as well as of the country,\u201d Ms. Mufti said. Terming \u201cpeople her strength\u201d, Ms. Mufti said J&K had to act as \u201ca bridge between India and Pakistan\u201d and the \u201cmistrust between New Delhi and Srinagar should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision of Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi to visit Lahore made my father very happy in the hospital. He said \u2018he [Modi] could make powerful people understand the importance of engaging with Pakistan\u2019,\u201d she added.\n\nReaching out to the separatist constituency, Ms. Mufti said she was \u201cpained to see mothers whose sons with B.A. and M.A. degrees die in encounters.\u201d",
