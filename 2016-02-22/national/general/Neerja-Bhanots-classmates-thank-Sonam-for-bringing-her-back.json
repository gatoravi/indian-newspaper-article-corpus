Classmates of the late air hostess have also thanked Sonam for bringing Bhanot back to life on the silver screen.\n\nThe actor was touched by a special message by Bhanot\u2019s classmates, and credited director Ram Madhvani for being the captain of the film. The message read: \u201cDear Sonam, Your critics and colleagues will congratulate you for your performance as Neerja and I believe you will win awards and accolades in truck loads for this movie. But to us who were Neerja\u2019s classmates in school you did something much much more. You brought her back to life after nearly 30 years. She is now back among us again. For that on behalf of the Batch 78 Bombay Scottish Alumni, her friends and family, I thank you. Sanjit Shastri\u201d. \u2014 IANS",
