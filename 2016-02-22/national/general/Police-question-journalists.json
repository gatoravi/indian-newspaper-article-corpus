Throughout Sunday, police teams went about calling journalists or going to their residence to question them. Most of these journalists, which include women, report on education or crime and have been covering the episode.\n\nSome of the media persons are believed to have called up Khalid and other absconding students before or after the February 9 incident at JNU. Police obtained a list of these journalists after examining call records of Umar Khalid and the others. According to police sources, the South district\u2019s Special Task Force are trying to contact the journalists.\n\n\u201cWe tried questioning these journalists as we believe they have spoken to the suspects and may be able to provide some clues about their locations,\u201d said a senior police officer.",
