    "text": "Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) leader Vijayakant on Sunday lost his position as Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly as eight of his party\u2019s rebel MLAs handed over their resignations to Speaker P. Dhanapal. This effectively reduced the strength of the DMDK in the outgoing Assembly to 20. PMK rebel legislator M. Kalaiarasan (expelled from the party in 2014) and Puthiya Tamilagam rebel MLA A. Ramasamy also resigned their memberships.\n\nSignificantly, they resigned a day after the Assembly\u2019s last session was adjourned sine die on Saturday. All of them are expected to join the ruling AIADMK as they have openly hailed Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the last several months. The DMDK had emerged the second largest party in the Assembly in 2011 when 29 of its candidates were elected as part of the AIADMK-led alliance. However, within a couple of years, its senior leader Panruti Ramachandran resigned his membership from the Alandur constituency and joined the ruling AIADMK. Subsequently, eight dissident MLAs openly identified themselves with the AIADMK but did not switch camps. Nonetheless, the dissidents were provided separate seats in the Assembly. Following the resignation of the dissident MLAs, Assembly Secretary AMP Jamaludeen announced that DMDK leader Vijayakant has ceased to be the Leader of Opposition.",
