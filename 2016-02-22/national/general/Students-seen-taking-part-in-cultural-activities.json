    "text": "The Delhi Police have been particularly looking for Umar Khalid. All five students were seen on Sunday night participating in cultural activities organised as a part of the ongoing protests demanding Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s release. There is no clarity on where these students were all these days.\n\nShehla Rashid, JNU students\u2019 union vice-president, told The Hindu that the five students are innocent. \u201cThey will be here only. If the police want, they can come and arrest them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe police had given the names of the five students to the court on the same day they arrested Mr Kumar.\n\nAccording to the police, these students were involved in shouting anti-national slogans on February 9 when an event to mark the death anniversary of Afzal Guru was organised on the campus. A case under charges of sedition and criminal conspiracy was lodged against unknown persons on February 11. A day later, Mr Kumar was arrested from the campus.\n\nJNU had also constituted an internal committee to investigate the February 9 incident. The five students who have been named in the FIR also figure in the JNU\u2019s internal committee report. The students have been debarred from all academic activities by the university administration.",
