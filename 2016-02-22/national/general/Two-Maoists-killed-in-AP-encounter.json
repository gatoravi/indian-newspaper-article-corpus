There was no casualty on the police side.\n\nThe exchange of fire occurred about 140 km from the Koyyuru headquarters and as per reports, both the slain Maoists were men and were from the Galikonda area committee.\n\nAccording to Superintendent of Police Koya Praveen, the Maoists were spotted by the police party. Sources said there were about 10 to 12 of them and the rest retreated under the cover of fire.\n\nPolice recovered two 12 bore single barrel guns, some cartridges and two kit bags containing two mobile phones, uniforms and Maoist literature.\n\nAs part of the area domination exercise due to the recently held high-profile events such as the CII Partnership Summit and the International Fleet Review (IFR) in Visakhapatnam, the areas were screened and there have been no reports of sighting of Maoists, in the last one month.\n\nSources in the police say members of the Galikonda dalam would have moved into the area or were trying to make their way into parts of G.K. Veedhi and Koyyuru to incite the locals on the bauxite mining issue.",
