Tushar Mahajan from Udhampur and Lance Naik Om Prakash (32), both from 9 Para Special Forces, who succumbed to injuries in hospital. Two personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) \u2014 Head Constable Driver R.K. Rana and Head Constable Bhola Singh \u2014 were also killed in the operation. \u201cCapt. Kumar was killed as he was leading his men. The operation was tricky as the possibility of some civilians being trapped inside the building was not ruled out,\u201d said an officer.\n\nOn hearing about his son\u2019s death, Capt. Kumar\u2019s father, Rajbir Singh, said, \u201cI had one child, I gave him to the Army, to the nation. No father can be prouder.\u201d\n\nCapt. Kumar\u2019s death and his father\u2019s comments could not be any starker to the developments in their home State Haryana burning due to the agitation by the Jat community. \u201cHe was destined to be in the Army as he was born on Army Day,\u201d the father said.\n\nAccording to Army officers, Capt. Kumar had taken part in two successful operations, including the one on February 15 in Pulwama where one terrorist and two civilians were killed.\n\nCapt. Kumar was born on January 15, 1993, graduated from the 123 course of the National Defence Academy and was commissioned into the Army on December 14, 2013. He was with the 10 Para Special Forces and in service for less than three years.\n\n\u201cPawan Kumar was a young and a dynamic officer. He was a true commander,\u201d said Lt. Gen. S.K. Dua, General Officer Commanding of the Udhampur-based 15 Corps.",
