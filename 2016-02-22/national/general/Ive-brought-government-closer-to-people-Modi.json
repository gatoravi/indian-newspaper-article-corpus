They would invite 200 to 400 people to the Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi and light some candles [at the launch of programmes]. Some media friends also used to help them. But I have brought the government out of Delhi and among the people.\u201d\n\nHis government is for the Dalits, the tribals and the poor, Mr. Modi said.\n\nPraising Kovarbai, a 104-year-old woman from the State, for selling her goats to build a toilet in her home, Mr. Modi called her a \u201csymbol of new development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the signal and a proof of a new beginning. Don\u2019t show my speech, but show my mother Kovarbai\u2019s achievement,\u201d he asked the media covering the event.\n\nHe said the \u2018Rurban Mission\u2019 was aimed at \u201creducing the burden of migration to the cities\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is the culmination of rural and urban. Development should be in such a way that its soul should be in the villages and the cities should be its body. The mission will reduce pressure on cities and provide a new avenue to people living in villages.\u201d\n\nUnder the mission, around 300 \u201curban growth centres\u201d would be developed in different parts of the country for \u201cproper economic development.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi made a special mention of Ambagad village in Rajnandgaon for \u201clevying a tax on open defecation.\u201d",
