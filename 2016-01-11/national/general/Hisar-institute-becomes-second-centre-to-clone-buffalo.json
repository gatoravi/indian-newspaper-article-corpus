    "text": "Scientists at the Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes (CIRB) here claimed to have successfully produced a cloned buffalo offspring \u2018Cirb Gaurav\u2019.\n\nCIRB Director Inderjeet Singh said on Sunday the scientists achieved the success on December 11 last year.\n\n\u201cThis cloned buffalo calf is distinct from the earlier clones produced in India. As this is produced from cells of ventral side of tail of superior bull buffalo, this part is least exposed to sunlight and may have less mutation rate, and can be a good choice for isolation of donor cells to produce healthy clones,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Singh said the newborn cloned calf weighed 40.4 kg at the time of birth and was maintaining good health and showing normal activities.\n\nWith this achievement, CIRB becomes the world\u2019s third and India\u2019s second institute to produce cloned buffalo, he said. \u2014 PTI",
