    "text": "The stalemate at the Jadavpur University continued with the Vice Chancellor (V-C) Suranjan Das now confined to his room by agitating students for more than 48 hours.\n\nThe students have been agitating outside the V-C\u2019s room since Friday, demanding that he announce dates for University student council elections though the West Bengal government had recently issued an advisory to State-run universities asking them not to hold elections to students\u2019 unions in February as it would coincide with school board exams.\n\nLate on Sunday evening, the Governor\u2019s office reportedly called the VC following which an emergency Executive Council meeting was held. The students then held a meeting with the V-C and student representatives said they \u201cmay announce\u201d the outcome of the meeting later at night. The VC, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension, was examined by a doctor in the afternoon.",
