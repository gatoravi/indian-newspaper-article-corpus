    "text": "Britain\u2019s intelligence services had tried to recruit Indian-origin Islamic State terror suspect Siddhartha Dhar as a double agent before he managed to flee to Syria, a media report here claimed on Sunday.\n\nDhar, who was dubbed the \u201cnew Jihadi John\u201d after he emerged as the key suspect as the masked terrorist seen in a recent IS video threatening an attack on Britain, was allegedly contacted twice by the MI5 officers before he was arrested for terrorist offences, the Sunday Times reported.\n\nQuoting a security source the paper said that Dhar, who goes by the name of Abu Rumaysah, had earlier been tracked and stopped in the street by the MI5 officers in what is known as a \u201cbump\u201d operation.\n\nThe 32-year-old Dhar was warned he was on the MI5\u2019s \u201cradar\u201d and his activities were being monitored.\n\nDhar was contacted by the MI5 for a second time and was offered the chance to work for the agency. It is not known how he responded, the newspaper claims.\n\nDhar, a Hindu-born Muslim convert and former bouncy castle salesman from London, was allegedly warned that he was likely to end up in jail or dead unless he agreed to become a double agent gathering intelligence on terrorist suspects for the security service.\n\nA few days after the second contact was made, in September 2014, Dhar was arrested alongside extremist preacher Anjem Choudary on suspicion of links to the banned Al-Muhajiroun. \u2014 PTI",
