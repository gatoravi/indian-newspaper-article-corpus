The UAV was seized by the Tiruvannamalai Taluk police who released the accused on bail.\n\nFlying UAV without prior permission of the competent authority is banned in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe techies were employed in major IT firms in Chennai. Only a week ago, a UK national was accused of flying a UAV over the holy hill and the flying object was seized.\n\nThe motive of these persons who sought to obtain aerial visuals of Tiruvannamalai hill and the famous Arunachaleswarar Temple was under investigation, police sources said.\n\nThe techies had purchased the UAV online at a cost of Rs. 1.20 lakh. Cyber experts were being roped in to analyse the visuals recorded in the gadget.\n\nOn earlier occasions, UAV or drones were deployed by scientists of the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT) in association with the Tamil Nadu police for security arrangements during Karthigai Deepam festival when several thousands of people visit the temple.",
