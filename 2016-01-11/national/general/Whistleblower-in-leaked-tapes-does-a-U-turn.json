But the truth is that I never said that the voices in the CD were that of mine or that of Ajit Jogi [senior Congress leader], Amit Jogi [Congress MLA], Puneet Gupta [son-in-law of CM], Manturam Pawar [the Congress candidate who withdrew] or Amin Menon.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dirty politics\u2019\n\n\u201cIt appears my name is being dragged by some political parties which are playing dirty politics in the State. I strongly oppose it. I cannot say that the voice in the tape is that of mine. I have been maintaining that there should be an inquiry into this matter,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter the tapes were leaked to the media, Mr. Siddiqui had told some newspapers and a news channel that it was his voice in the tape.\n\nHis denial came a day after a press conference by State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, who alleged threat to his and Mr. Siddiqui\u2019s life.\n\nCongress\u2019 poser\n\nReacting to Mr. Siddiqui\u2019s letter to the Chief Secretary, Mr. Baghel said, \u201cHow did the letter he wrote to the Chief Secretary get leaked? The Chief Secretary has questioned only Mr. Siddiqui. What about others whose voice featured in the tapes? When is he going to question them?\u201d\n\nSays it is not his voice in the purported conversation to fix Chhattisgarh bypoll",
