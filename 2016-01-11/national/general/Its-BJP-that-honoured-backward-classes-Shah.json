Delegates from 19 States had converged here for the party\u2019s OBC Morcha meet. Mr. Shah also underlined the purpose of the Morcha, which came up in 2015, ensuring constitutional rights to OBCs without social disharmony, and reaching out to the most backward castes among the OBCs.\n\nThe former Prime Minister, H.D. Deve Gowda\u2019s assertion last year that he was the first OBC Prime Minister notwithstanding, Mr. Shah claimed once again that Narendra Modi was India\u2019s first Prime Minister from a backward caste.\n\n\u201cWe alone had the courage to choose a person from a poor, backward family for the Prime Minister\u2019s post. Today he is making India proud globally,\u201d Mr. Shah said.\n\nHe hit out at the Congress for having \u201cignored\u201d the OBCs, saying the word \u201cbackward\u201d would not have to be still used for so many had the Kaka Kalelkar (First Backward Class Commission) report been accepted.\n\nAs for the Mandal Commission (Second Backward Class Commission), Mr. Shah said: \u201cIt was constituted by the Janata government, of which we were a part. Its recommendations were also accepted not by a Congress government but by the Jan Morcha, which we supported.\u201d\n\nThe context: the 1950 Constitution did mention the OBCs, but these two commissions went into who would be included in the category and what the government should do for them. Mr. Shah said the Morcha should aim at OBC rights sans caste conflict and reach out to the most backward castes among the OBCs.\n\nHe accused the OBC-related parties in north India of pursuing interests of a family or caste in the name of the whole category.",
