He added that scientific temper was a pre-requisite for innovation and research.\n\n\u201cAttempts to separate myth from fact, history from mythology, belief from scientifically verified facts are often frowned upon. Pursuant to it, occult is dubbed scientific and superstition as \u2018culture\u2019,\u201d Mr. Ansari said.\n\nThe word of caution comes at a time when scientists and historians have cautioned against recent attempts at discovering modern science prevalent in ancient times. Mr. Ansari said that while individual dissenters were often ostracised or killed, books were also banned or withdrawn.",
