The city can also boast having the maximum number of women engineers. At 1.4 lakh, women constitute a little more than 30 per cent of the work force \u2014 a ratio that increases to 40 per cent when considering the engineering work force below the age of 35.\n\nIt\u2019d seem like in the past decade \u2014 since the IT \u2018boom\u2019 took shape in the city in 2000s \u2014 the number of persons either graduating or migrating to the city with graduate degrees in tow has disproportionately increased.\n\nWhile the past decade has seen the population of Bengaluru urban rise by 47 per cent, the number of graduates (not just engineering) has risen by a staggering 125 per cent.\n\nWhile the influx of engineers from outside may have been a factor (the census 2011 figures on migrants are yet to be released), Narendar Pani, Professor, School of Social Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Studies, believed the nearly century-old inclination towards engineering as well as the collapse of interest in non-technical degrees in the city may have contributed to the rise in engineers here.\n\nMore than 70 per cent of the engineers in the city are below the age of 35",
