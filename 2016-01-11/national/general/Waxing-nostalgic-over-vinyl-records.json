Records also call for listeners to get involved by flipping them over. \u201cYou are sitting there actually enjoying the music,\u201d Moncada said of opting for vinyl records.\n\n\u201cYou have a connection with it in a sense; that is something a lot of us are starting to realize again.\u201d\n\nIn addition, many audiophiles appreciate the sound of music on vinyl, grainy edges and all.\n\nTurntables have been hot sellers for Los Angeles-based Boytone, which even has a model with a cassette tape player. An array of turntables found at CES were built into carry cases to go mobile in designs reminiscent of decades past. Despite vintage looks, new model turn tables boasted features such as Bluetooth connections to speakers of headphones, or being able to plug into computers so music on records could be \u201cripped,\u201d or copied, into digital files.\n\n\u201cIt allows you to keep your turntable and vinyl in one room while enjoying your records virtually anywhere in the house,\u201d Crystal Griffith of Audio-Technica said of wireless capabilities in a freshly-unveiled model.\n\nA new Sony turntable included the ability to automatically convert analogue music from records into digital format for listening on other devices. \u2014 AFP",
