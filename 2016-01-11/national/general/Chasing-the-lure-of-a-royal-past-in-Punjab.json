    "text": "Wealthy landowners want to keep alive the ways of maharajahs through traditions such as dog racing\n\nA column of all-wheel drives turned off a dusty road in rural Punjab last week, past ox carts and farm workers holding sickles, and came to a stop in an unmarked field. Helpers circled around to the backs of the vehicles and unloaded, ever so carefully, the animals everyone had come to see.\n\nThere were greyhounds from Canada, from Ireland and England, and a few from the United States. The track of plain tractor-groomed dirt belied the colossal investment represented by the dogs, many of which were housed in air-conditioned kennels and fed buttermilk and chicken.\n\nDogs are a big deal in this part of Punjab, about 30 km from the border with Pakistan. So is single-malt Scotch, skeet shooting and wild-boar pickle. The guardians of these traditions can be found seated in chairs arranged at the finish line: wealthy Sikh landowners who, despite government\u2019s attempts to dismantle the feudal system, are keeping alive the ways of the maharajahs and nawabs who came before them.\n\nOne of the most prominent among them, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, was scanning the track for a glimpse of a 17-month-old brindle bitch named Baby Doll. This was complicated, at times, by the number of young men coming by to bend down and touch his feet.\n\n\u201cAll the big families are into dogs,\u201d said Mr. Dhillon, who is known as Kiki. \u201cYou import the best dog. You have the best handler. It\u2019s not the horse competing, or the dog competing. It\u2019s the man\u2019s name competing.\u201d\n\nCostly hobby\n\nMr. Dhillon estimates the cost of a top greyhound at half-a-million rupees. This is a fraction of what he will pay for a Marwari stallion, a Perazzi shotgun or a big-game hunt in South Africa, but, still, it adds up.\n\n\u201cVery few families have been left with all this, I\u2019ll be very frank,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a bit of an expensive thing, the dogs, the upkeep.\u201d\n\nThe trainers arrive first, laying thick blankets on the ground for the greyhounds, which bruise easily. Then come the dogs\u2019 owners, recognizable by their quilted vests and Gucci sunglasses.\n\nMany wealthy families here own chains of gas stations in the United States or Canada, and most have relatives there. One imposing man, who turned out to be a police officer, explained in rapid-fire fashion that \u201cI am doing duty as a gunman for Kiki Dhillon\u201d and that \u201cmy in-laws are settled in Modesto (California).\u201d\n\nEven without the benefit of elected office, the scions of old families serve as a kind of shadow government.\n\nMr. Dhillon is an excellent example. Though he lost his most recent parliamentary election, he still spends several hours a day receiving petitioners who wait on his terrace, bringing him their problems and occasionally asking him to settle disputes. They refer to him as \u201csardar,\u201d akin to \u201cchieftain.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunism was never a hit in North India,\u201d he said. Mr. Dhillon\u2019s family owns interstate buses and trades in liquor, but he spends most of his time on politics.\n\nHe has four cellphones, two of which are in the possession of his personal secretary, and they ring approximately every 5 minutes, including when he is on horseback. \u201cThe main job for politicians is not to make laws, the main job is to go to social functions,\u201d he said, a little wearily. \u201cThere are all these deaths.\u201d\n\nDog races offer some relief from this routine. A man turns a crank, the dead rabbit scoots down the track on a wire and two dogs shoot out at a full gallop, their spines flexing like springs. Greyhounds can be legally raced only using a mechanical lure, in this case a bedraggled dead rabbit affixed to a dinner plate.\n\nDust rises around the men along the track: farmers with deeply lined faces; New Jersey gas station moguls; one princeling in aviator sunglasses who described himself happily as \u201cthat type of guy, you give me $100,000, I guarantee within two, three days, I am spending every penny.\u201d\n\nIn the end, top prizes went to the dogs belonging to Punjabis living in North America; one of them, an electrical engineer, lives outside Detroit and raced a dog from West Virginia. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
