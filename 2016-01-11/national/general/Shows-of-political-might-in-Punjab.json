The SAD-BJP, on the other hand, is harping on development and good governance during its rule in the State to garner people\u2019s support.\n\nLeaders of the AAP are expecting at least five lakh people to attend the rally.\n\nSucha Singh Chotepur, the convener of the AAP\u2019s Punjab unit, said several senior leaders of other parties, including those of the Congress and the Akali Dal, were keen to join the AAP in the presence of Mr. Kejriwal at the Muktsar rally.\n\nThe Congress has also planned its rally in the same area on the day. Capt. (retd.) Singh told The Hindu that the AAP had become a junkyard for deadwood in the Congress, while the SAD-BJP had failed on all fronts.\n\n\u201cWe will try to convince the people that they (AAP) don\u2019t have a face or programme. And on the other hand, we have had 10 years of bad governance (SAD-BJP rule), and we may not recover if another bad government is elected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Congress will take up issues such as corruption, drugs, unemployment and lawlessness.\n\nThe SAD, meanwhile, is planning to hold its rally at a 22-acre site with Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal overseeing arrangements for the rally. SAD leaders said the government had done immense development work and now it was time that the message was conveyed to the people.\n\nKejriwal to launch election campaign, other parties to hold rallies at Muktsar",
