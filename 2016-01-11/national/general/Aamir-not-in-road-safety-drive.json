There must have been talks about the TV show (Satyameva Jayate) in which the road safety issue was raised but the Ministry never appointed him as the face of the campaign,\u201d said a senior Ministry official.\n\nRoad Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari had publicly announced in October last year that he had approached Mr. Khan to support the road safety awareness programmes in the country and the actor had \u201cagreed to support the cause.\u201d However, since then, there has been no mention about the actor\u2019s participation in the Road Safety Week.\n\nThe series of events throughout the week will see participation of celebrities such as cricketer Gautam Gambhir and actor John Abraham, Ministry sources said.\n\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh will flag off the Road Safety Walk at India Gate here on Monday.\n\nLater in the day, Mr. Gadkari will hold a press conference to discuss the issue of road safety with the media. \u201cDuring the week, awareness about various causes of road accidents and measures to prevent them will be highlighted by organising various activities with school or college students, drivers and all other road users,\u201d a statement from the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways said.\n\nOther events the Ministry will be a part of include awareness campaign during National Youth Festival in Raipur, a seminar organised by Geneva-based International Road Federation in which State government officials will participate.",
