The statement comes a day after the DDCA filed defamation cases against him and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe MP from Bihar told presspersons that no one could deter him from the fight against corruption in the DDCA. Mr. Azad held the DDCA responsible for the escalation of cost in the renovation of the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in 2008. He offered to produce more evidence of corruption in DDCA affairs when the defamation case against him came up for hearing.",
