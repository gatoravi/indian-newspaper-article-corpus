    "text": "A Bihar government website has said that the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s rule was worse than that of the British, angering the Congress which is a constituent of the ruling coalition.\n\nThe mention about \u201cautocratic rule\u201d of Indira Gandhi and \u201coppression\u201d perpetrated during the Emergency has been made in a write-up on Bihar\u2019s history.\n\nThe write-up, while mentioning the contribution of Jayaprakash Narayan or JP to modern Indian history, says \u201cit was he who steadfastly and staunchly opposed the autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.\u201d\n\n\u201cFearing people\u2019s reaction to his [JP\u2019s] opposition, Indira Gandhi had him arrested on the eve of declaring National Emergency beginning June 26, 1975. He was put in the Tihar jail, where notorious criminals are jailed.\n\n\u201cThus, in Free India, this septuagenarian [JP], who had fought for India\u2019s freedom alongside Indira Gandhi\u2019s father, Jawahar Lal Nehru, received a treatment that was worse than what the British had meted out to Gandhiji in Champaran in 1917, for his speaking out against oppression.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
