In every society, there are some people who are intolerant,\u201d the self-exiled author said at an event here, while referring to the recent violence in Malda in West Bengal.\n\nShe said while there was talk about Hindu fundamentalists, one had to talk of Muslim fundamentalists as well. Ms. Nasreen said absolute freedom of speech was necessary even if it offended some people.\n\n\u201cIf we do not open our mouths, society will not evolve. Of course, we should fight misogyny, religious fundamentalism and all kinds of evil forces only to make the society better.\u201d The writer was participating in a discussion on \u2018Coming of the Age of Intolerance\u2019 at the ongoing Delhi Literature Festival at Dilli Haat here on Saturday evening.\n\nOn the other hand, BJP ideologue and writer Sudheendra Kulkarni said absolute freedom could only be exercised with responsibility. \u201cThere is no freedom whatsoever to show any religion in bad light, knowing that it will hurt sentiments and insult others. I completely disagree that writers should have absolute freedom. Freedom must be exercised with responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kulkarni said India as a country was \u201cessentially tolerant.\u201d \u2014 IANS\n\n\u2018We should focus not only on Hindu fundamentalists, but Muslim fundamentalists as well\u2019",
