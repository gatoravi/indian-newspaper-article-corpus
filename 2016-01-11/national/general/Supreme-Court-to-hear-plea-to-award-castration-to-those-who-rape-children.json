    "text": "The Supreme Court, on Monday, will decide on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Women Lawyers\u2019 Association (SCWLA) seeking castration as a punishment for child rapists.\n\nThe court is hearing the petition at a time when new anti-rape laws have made rape punishable with the death penalty. The association, represented by senior lawyer Mahalaxmi Pavani, described its petition as a \u201cfeeble and strong appeal to this highest court of the country to come out in support of these innocent and unprotected children of our country\u201d. The petition quotes passages from the works of ancient Greek tragedian Sophocles, observations made by Justice N. Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court and Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu\u2019s comments to back its plea. \u201cWhen the law is ineffective and incapable of addressing the menace, this court cannot keep its hands folded and remain a silent spectator, unmoved and oblivious of the recent happenings of horrible blood-curdling gang rapes of children in various parts of India,\u201d says the petition quoting Justice Kirubakaran in a recent judgment.\n\nIt then goes on to quote the \u201creaction\u201d of Mr. Venkaiah Naidu to this judgment. \u201cHe said, \u2018Happy about the Madras High Court judgment. \u2018Human Right\u2019 is not a term restricted to, and only reserved for, offenders.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt also quotes Sophocles: \u201cLaws can never be enforced unless fear supports them.\u201d\n\nNoting that the court could fill in when there was a vacuum in the statutory law, the petition said, \u201cCastration is any action, surgical, chemical or otherwise, by which a biological male loses sex drive.\u201d\n\nNew law has already added the death penalty as a punishment for the offence of rape",
