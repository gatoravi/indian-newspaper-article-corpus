    "text": "In the first week of the ongoing placement programme at the Indian Institute of Technology \u2013 Madras, as many as 564 students have been placed. Last year, only 550 students were placed by the end of the first week. Offers in the core, public sector undertaking and research and development areas have accounted for 47 per cent of the offers. Of the 617 candidates who have been placed at least eight students have received three offers and 61 candidates had two offers each. According to Babu Viswanathan, advisor, placement at the IIT-Madras, Coal India has taken 13 candidates. \u201cThis year we took a conscious decision to increase core sector placement. Usually core sector placements are done in the second week. While the PSUs offer regular roles some companies have come specifically for research and development,\u201d he said.",
