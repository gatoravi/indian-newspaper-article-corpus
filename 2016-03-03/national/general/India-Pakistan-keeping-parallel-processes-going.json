Jaishankar said at the Ministry of External Affairs\u2019 \u2018Raisina Dialogue\u2019 in Delhi on Tuesday that the governments of India and Pakistan had remained in touch at different levels including through regular telephone conversations between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Nasir Janjua, the Foreign secretaries, and Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif, calling it a \u201cpicture of parallel processes.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Secretary\u2019s statement, in response to a question after he delivered a Keynote Address at the Raisina conference, seemed to corroborate Pakistan Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz\u2019s statement in Washington, where he accepted that the FS talks had been disrupted after the Pathankot airbase attack.\n\nThanking the U.S. for its support in reviving the India-Pakistan dialogue, Mr. Aziz said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the \u201cagreement on resuming the dialogue process was disrupted by the attack on Pathankot airbase on January 2,\u201d and listed several steps taken by Pakistan in its aftermath of the attack.\n\nInterestingly, the Pakistan-U.S. statement confirmed that Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar was taken into custody, although the MEA insists it has not been informed of the development yet.",
