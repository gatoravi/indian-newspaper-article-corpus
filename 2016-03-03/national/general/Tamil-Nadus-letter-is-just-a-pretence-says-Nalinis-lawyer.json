    "text": "M. Radhakrishnan, a defence lawyer, has termed \u201cpretence\u201d the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s letter to the Centre, seeking its views on its decision to free all the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan is the lawyer for Nalini, whose death sentence was commuted to life by the State government in 2000.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe State government can release all the life convicts today under Article 161 of the Constitution. The power under Article 161 is unfettered. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court is categorical that this power is untouchable by the court. There is no need to obtain any permission or any views from the Central government for releasing the life convicts. The State government is well within its right to release them immediately under Article 161.\u201d\n\nReview\n\n\u201cThe letter simply says they are going to seek a review of the Constitution Bench\u2019s judgment, which is unnecessary. The State government is playing with the lives of these seven life convicts. This is highly regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very happy as a mother to hear that the Tamil Nadu government has initiated efforts to release my son once again. However, I don\u2019t want to go through the trauma that I suffered last time when he was almost released. I hope Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government will take a favourable view. My husband is unwell and when he heard this news, he became hopeful. But I don\u2019t think he will be able to withstand another disappointment\u2026 I will feel relieved only when he is released,\u201d said Arputhammal, Perarivalan\u2019s mother.\n\n( With inputs from Udhav Naig and Serena M.
