I don\u2019t think it is possible for a person in India to organise her killing in Australia. Moreover, I am dumbfounded by this theory as I find no motive for anybody known to us to murder her this way. We don\u2019t want any innocents to be targeted,\u201d he told The Hindu on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Kumar said he had told the New South Wales police about two incidents that Prabha shared with him, that occurred during her work stay in Australia. However, he declined to disclose details of these incidents as they might hamper the probe.\n\n\u201cThe police haven\u2019t been in touch with the family. The last time I spoke to them was in November 2015 when I had been to Australia to inaugurate a memorial plaque for my wife in Parramatta Park,\u201d he said.\n\nAn e-mail query to New South Wales Police from The Hindu went unanswered.\n\nPolice want to visit India\n\nThe homicide detectives probing the case have been quoted by the Australian media as saying they will visit India soon. \u201cThere are aspects of Mrs. Kumar\u2019s life that need to be explored further,\u201d the detectives have been quoted in a report in The Sydney Morning Herald .\n\nFamily coming to\n\nterms with loss\n\nPrabha\u2019s family is slowly coming to terms with the loss. The most hit though is her daughter, now 12 years old, preparing for her Class 6 exams.\n\nArun Kumar said it was tragic she lost her mother at a time most daughters need a mother to guide them. \u201cPrabha and I had dreamt of a future for her and now my only goal in life is to make that dream a reality,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kumar recounted the horror of the night when Prabha was stabbed to death even as he was speaking to her over phone.\n\n\u201cThat has been the toughest day of my life and I have never felt as helpless as that. I could hear her being attacked, scream for help and later breathe for around 20 minutes on the phone. It was like she was suffering before me, but I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.",
