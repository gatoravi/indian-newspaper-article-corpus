    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi made a frontal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government\u2019s handling of the economy, foreign policy and domestic issues in a speech laced with mockery, sarcasm and banter in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking during a debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to both Houses of Parliament, Mr. Gandhi alleged that the government was running on \u201chis [PM\u2019s] own opinion\u201d, forgetting that \u201cthe country is not the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister is not the country.\u201d\n\nHe accused Mr. Modi of releasing Pakistan from the \u201ccage\u201d that the previous UPA government had put it in after the 26/11 attacks by his unilateral decision to \u201chave a cup of tea with Mr. Nawaz Sharif in Lahore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the 26/11, when the situation was delicate, he insisted on visiting Mumbai. Not just that, the UPA government put in thousands of hours of work into diplomatic channels and provided employment and self-help groups in Kashmir to break the back of militancy, and what does the Prime Minister do?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHe decided to have a cup of tea with Nawaz Sharif without any vision. He decided to take a detour to Pakistan. Just like the Naga Accord.\n\n\u201cHe did not bother to consult anyone...the people in intelligence, the diplomats. Perhaps he did not even talk to [External Affairs Minister] Sushmaji [Swaraj]. Only his opinion matters.",
