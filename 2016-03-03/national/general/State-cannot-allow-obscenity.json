    "text": "Hours after the Supreme Court disallowed Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras in dance bars, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday that the State would approach the court with an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe State can\u2019t permit obscenity it has seen in the past in dance bars. We will approach the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court with an alternative. The State government is also contemplating a suitable legislation,\u201d Mr Fadnavis said on his official Twitter handle.\n\nThe reaction to the verdict among hotel and bar owners was euphoric. Adarsh Shetty, president of the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association, said:\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the judgment and the order by the SC. We are happy that some of the points that were irrelevant have been completely rejected by the court, including the CCTV thing.\u201d",
