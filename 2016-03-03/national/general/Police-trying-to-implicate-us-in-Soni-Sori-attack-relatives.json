Soni Sori\u2019s nephew Lingaram Kodopi went on to allege that the police were also trying to \u201cimplicate\u201d her relatives in the case.\n\n\u201cWe fear that the police might implicate me or Soni Sori\u2019s cousin Ajay Markam in the case of an attack on her. Since the formation of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), I have been asked to come to the police station thrice. Every time they ask us the same questions and we are being given disrespectful treatment,\u201d Mr. Kodopi told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cAjay Markam was also called to the police station for enquiry. Ajay Markam was told that he, along with me and Sanjay Pant, were involved in the attack on Soni Sori,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThis was not the first time Mr. Kodopi, the only Tribal journalist in Bastar, was being targeted by the authorities. A few years ago, Mr. Kodopi was implicated along with Soni Sori in an alleged case of a corporate house pay off to the Maoists.\n\nAccording to him, he was inhumanly tortured in the custody and a petrochemical liquid was put in his rectum for which he is still undergoing treatment.\n\nDespite bad health, Mr. Kodopi has been the main support for Soni Sori, who has emerged the face of Tribal protest in Bastar in the past few years.\n\nThe nephew of Soni Sori also accused the police of \u201cpressurising\u201d AAP leader Arvind Gupta to take back the police complaint which he filed against unknown persons after the attack on Soni Sori on February 19.\n\nBastar range Inspector General of police SRP Kalluri was unavailable for comments.\n\nThey allege that they were being \u201charassed and intimidated\u201d by\n\nthe Bastar police",
