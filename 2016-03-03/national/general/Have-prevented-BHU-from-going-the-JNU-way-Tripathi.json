Tripathi has been accused of pursuing an \u201cRSS agenda\u201d on the campus and filling administrative and academic posts with those affiliated to the organisation.\n\nIn an interview to The Hindu , Mr. Tripathi was candid about his four-decade-old association with the RSS, but asserted that \u201cuniversities don\u2019t belong to any ideology,\u201d adding that he was following the mandate given to him by the government.\n\nAmid the controversy at Jawaharlal Nehru University over what is \u201canti-national,\u201d Mr. Tripathi, a former Allahabad University professor, said he would never allow his university to conduct events on \u201ccontroversial and sensitive\u201d issues such as the hanging of Afzal Guru, Kashmir\u2019s \u2018independence\u2019 or beef. There were attempts to rake up similar issues at the university, but its \u201c100-year-old culture and tradition\u201d and his administrative alertness prevented the institution from going the JNU way, he said.\n\n\u201cJNU has always embodied opposition to the system. Its culture divides polity into two groups: the rulers and the ruled. Once the government is formed, JNU automatically puts itself in the opposition\u2026 That is its sanskriti [culture],\u201d Mr. Tripathi said.\n\nStudents should have training and education in democracy, but universities \u201cshould not become practising platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, IIT-BHU dismissed Magsaysay award winner Sandeep Pandey on the charge that he was indulging in \u201canti-national\u201d activities and was a Naxalite.\n\nDr. Pandey, who has taken the battle to court, alleged that his dismissal was due to ideological differences with the \u201cRSS-minded Vice-Chancellor.\u201d\n\nMr. Tripathi said Dr. Pandey was attempting to rake up \u201ccontroversial and sensitive\u201d issues at the university, such as beef and Kashmir\u2019s \u2018independence.\u2019 However, he would not challenge the court order if it favoured his re-installation.\n\nMr. Tripathi was proud of his \u201cdeep engagement with the RSS thought\u201d and was not shy of calling himself a \u201cman of the RSS.\u201d But he was not working to impose its agenda.\n\n\u201cI am part of the RSS. Don\u2019t RSS people have a right to stay in this country? If I am running an agenda here, tell me. Have I told anyone to attend a shakha [a daily meeting of the RSS] in the morning?\u201d\n\nG.C. Tripathi says he is part of the RSS but is not imposing its agenda on anyone",
