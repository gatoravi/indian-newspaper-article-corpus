The People\u2019s Democratic Party\u2019s sell-out to the BJP has brought disillusionment, disempowerment and contempt for the people,\u201d he said at a public meeting in Shopian district of south Kashmir.\n\nHe accused the PDP of \u201centering into an alliance with those who want to abolish our flag, destroy our special status and patronise those who persecute people on the basis of what they eat and do not eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past year, the BJP has used its alliance with the PDP to make out its politics of polarisation to be that of inclusivity,\u201d Mr. Abdullah said.\n\n\u201cBJP and RSS leaders continue to spew venom on minorities. I can never have anything to do with these people and would refuse every position of power that comes at the cost of the dignity of my people.\u201d The former Chief Minister said the PDP was \u201cstill extremely keen on forming a government with the BJP yet again and the delay [in government formation] is an attempt by the party to fake a sense of ideological conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cPDP leader Mehbooba Mufti says the 10-month-long PDP-BJP government did not benefit the people. If this government did not benefit the people, who are the actual beneficiaries, and why the PDP is still in an alliance with the BJP,\u201d he said.",
