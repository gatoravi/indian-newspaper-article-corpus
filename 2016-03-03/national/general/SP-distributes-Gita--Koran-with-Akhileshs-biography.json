It now claims that it is also distributing copies of the Koran .\n\n\u201cAkhilesh Yadav is the hero of our composite culture. We are distributing the Gita and the Koran among the educated people to make them aware of the misrepresentation of Hinduism by the BJP-RSS combine, and expose how these organisations tried to destroy our composite culture,\u201d said Mr. Pandey. This seems to be a local initiative as the central leadership claimed it was not aware of it.\n\nChief Minister is the hero of our composite culture, says the party",
