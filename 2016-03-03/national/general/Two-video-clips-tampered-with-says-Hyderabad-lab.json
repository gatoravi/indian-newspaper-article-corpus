    "text": "Hyderabad-based Truth Labs, an independent forensic science laboratory in the country, has confirmed to the Delhi government that two of the seven video clips of the Jawaharlal Nehru University incidents sent to it for examination were tampered.\n\nDirector of Truth Labs and a renowned forensic expert, K.P.C. Gandhi, told The Hindu over phone that forensic examination of the video clips proved that they were manipulated.\n\nDeclining to divulge technical details of the Labs findings, Mr. Gandhi, however, said the report was already sent to the Delhi government. The video clips pertain to two incidents reported on the campus of the JNU. These videos triggered country-wide protests with some sections of the students alleging that the videos were doctored and others charging that students raised anti-national slogans.\n\nMr. Gandhi said that the video clips sent to the Labs were not the original ones. \u201cThese clips were already in circulation,\u201d he pointed out. Sources maintained that the video clips were collected from different sources like social websites and Youtube.\n\nPolice version\n\nPolice officials seeking anonymity said some words were incorporated into the video clips apparently to provoke others.\n\n\u201cThe sloganeering voices heard in the video clip seem to have been introduced into the original ones creating an impression that they were original. It is difficult for ordinary people to ascertain that part of the video clips were fake,\u201d a forensic expert unwilling to be named said.\n\nIt is for the investigators to find out original sources of the video clips, he said.\n\nThe footage pertains to two incidents reported at Jawaharlal Nehru University",
