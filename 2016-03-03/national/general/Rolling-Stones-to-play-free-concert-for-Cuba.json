    "text": "The Rolling Stones has announced a free concert in Cuba in what is likely to be one of the biggest shows ever both for the island and the rock legends.\n\nThe March 25 concert will take place four days after a historic visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, a powerful sign that the communist state is joining the global mainstream after decades of tension with Washington.\n\nThe Rolling Stones will play their first-ever concert in Cuba at the open-air sports complex Ciudad Deportiva in the capital Havana. \u201cWe have performed in many special places during our long career, but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too,\u201d the band said in a statement.\n\nCuba has a famously rich musical heritage but revolutionary leader Fidel Castro banned rock and roll in 1961, fearing a degenerate influence from the U.S.-born art form. The island eventually relaxed its ban but missed the full force of the \u201cBritish invasion\u201d by bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. Cuban rock fans had to resort to black-market recordings. \u2014 AFP\n\nCuba has a famously rich musical heritage, but revolutionary leader Fidel Castro banned rock and roll in 1961, fearing a degenerate influence from the U.S.-born art form",
