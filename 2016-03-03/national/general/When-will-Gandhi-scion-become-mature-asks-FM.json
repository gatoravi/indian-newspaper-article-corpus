    "text": "Finance Minister Arun Jaitley attacked Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi soon after his speech in Parliament on Wednesday, wondering when he would become \u201cmature\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs one evolves from a young to a middle-aged one, we certainly expect a certain level of maturity. The more I hear Shri Rahul Gandhi, the more I start wondering 'how much does he know \u2014 when will he know',\u201d Mr. Jaitley said in a statement.\n\nHe asserted that contrary to Mr. Gandhi's claims that Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept his Ministers in the dark regarding matters pertaining to their departments, the Ministers were responsible for the work of their departments.\n\n\u201cEach one of us, whether the External Affairs Minister, the Home Minister or myself, are responsible for each important decision taken by each of one departments. We do not by-pass the Prime Minister who is always available for consultation and guidance,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said.\n\nHe then asserted that unlike in the UPA days, the Prime Minister should be the \u201cnatural leader\u201d of the party and government.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister should be the natural leader of the party and the government. In the NDA it is so. The UPA was quite different. The Prime Minister is to lead by example,\u201d he said.",
