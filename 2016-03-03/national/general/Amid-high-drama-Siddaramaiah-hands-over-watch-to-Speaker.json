The watch, estimated to be worth several lakhs, will be placed in the Cabinet Hall of the State Secretariat.\n\nThe Speaker handed over the watch to Chief Secretary Arvind Jadhav and directed him to keep it in the Cabinet Hall.\n\nThere is a tradition of keeping rare gifts given to Chief Ministers in the Cabinet Hall.\n\nUnrelenting Opposition\n\nHowever, an unrelenting BJP and the Janata Dal (S) continued to stall the proceedings of the State legislature, like it did on Tuesday, seeking a debate on the watch under the adjournment motion. But the demand was turned down by the Speaker.\n\n\u2018First of its kind\u2019\n\nThe development is being described as the first of its kind in the history of the State Legislative Assembly. Taking exception to the stance taken on the issue by Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Thimmappa, the BJP alleged that Mr. Siddaramaiah had shown disrespect to the Speaker by handing over the gift in the House in an \u201cemotional high drama.\u201d\n\nMaking a statement on the issue in the Assembly, Mr. Siddaramaaih reiterated that the watch was gifted to him in July 2015 by his friend Girish Chandra Varma, cardiac surgeon, who is an NRI based in Dubai.\n\nUnrelenting Opposition continues to stall the proceedings of the Assembly",
