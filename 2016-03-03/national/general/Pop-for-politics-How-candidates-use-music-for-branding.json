    "text": "From Katy Perry to David Bowie, the songs chosen by presidential candidates reflect their political personalities\n\nEven before voters get inside a Hillary Clinton campaign event, they\u2019re confronted with Katy Perry.\n\nMs. Clinton\u2019s team blasts the candidate\u2019s official playlist of mostly female-led pop ballad bangers \u2014 such as Perry\u2019s Roar and Stronger by Kelly Clarkson \u2014 so loudly it can easily be heard by those waiting outside venues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk or even hear yourself think,\u201d said Lauren Gambino, a Guardian reporter who has attended over 40 Clinton events this election.\n\nPop for politics is nothing new \u2014 Bill Clinton used Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop , and Barack Obama used will.i.am\u2019s Yes We Can , for instance \u2014 and candidates consider music a key element for establishing their personality and inspiring followers.\n\n\u201cMusic, as I see it, is the candidate\u2019s attempt to constitute their identity in sound,\u201d explained Dana Gorzelany-Mostak, an assistant professor in music at Georgia College.\n\n\u201cTo sonically construct themselves in a way that appeals to the voters but also offers insight to who they are and what they stand for,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Gorzelany-Mostak is creator and co-editor of \u2018Trax on the Trail\u2019, a research project examining the music in the 2016 election, from Bernie Sanders\u2019 folksy 1960s tunes of revolution to Marco Rubio\u2019s love of electronic dance music, aka EDM.\n\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s campaign songs burst out of speakers with virtually no links between them: there\u2019s the Rolling Stones\u2019 Brown Sugar to the Phantom of the Opera to the Hulk Hogan theme song, Real American .\n\nMr. Trump himself struts onto the stage to Nessun Dorma, a booming and aggressive Puccini aria, sung in Italian by Luciano Pavarotti.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unrepentantly fascist,\u201d said Dan Roberts, the Guardian \u2019s Washington bureau chief, likening it to attending at Benito Mussolini rally.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s eclectic mix, supposedly all chosen by him according to his love for the songs, is not typical presidential campaign picks. But they do reflect the unpredictably of the candidate.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s entire reputation is sort of built upon this idea of a candidate taking up unpopular positions,\u201d said Ms. Gorzelany-Mostak.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s beats reflect a young Latino man who grew up in Miami more than they do a conservative Republican, with Flo Rida, the Black Eyed Peas and Calvin Harris all on regular rotation. Lately, Mr. Rubio bounces out onto stage to AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck and leaves to Greater , by Christian pop group Mercy Me.\n\nMr. Rubio has spoken to CNN about his love for EDM, denying he had ever been to a rave but saying he grew up listening to 90s west coast hip hop, and now enjoys dance music. But he was careful to note that his favourites were country songs laid over electronic music \u2014 meaning the lyrics were clean. The country music is also \u201ca nod to the people he is campaigning in front of,\u201d said Sabrina Siddiqui, a journalist who has trailed the senator\u2019s campaign.\n\nConservative tones\n\nTed Cruz, the hard-line evangelical candidate from Texas, plays country and Christian pop, including Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly by Aaron Tippin and tunes from the Christian band Newsboys. But his music doesn\u2019t garner much attention, since his few tracks often repeat, and they clearly meld with his image as a conservative and deeply religious southerner.\n\nBernie Sander\u2019s music, like his politics, revolves around revolution: Power to the People by John Lennon, Talkin\u2019 Bout a Revolution by Tracy Chapman, The Revolution Starts Now by Steve Earle.\n\nBut ever since David Bowie\u2019s death in January, Mr. Sanders has left the stage to the strains of Bowie\u2019s Starman : \u201cThere\u2019s a starman waiting in the sky / He\u2019d like to come and meet us / But he thinks he\u2019d blow our minds\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategic pick. \u201cBowie: he\u2019s a rebel, a revolutionary, a radical, all wrapped in one charismatic man,\u201d Ms. Gorzelany\u2014Mostak said, asking \u201cCan Sanders channel some of that star magic?\u201d\n\nMs. Clinton\u2019s crowd is mainly middle-aged women, and not exactly the typical audience for a pop-star playlist of top 20 hits circa 2016, a list exemplified by Ms. Clinton\u2019s carefully curated Spotify playlist, which clearly targets younger people. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
