    "text": "Admitting for the first time that the Pathankot terror attack has had a deep impact on the India Pakistan dialogue process that was restarted in December 2015, the government today said that dealing with the attack took precedence over the Foreign Secretary talks at present, even as Pakistan disclosed Masood Azhar was in \u2018detention.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of a terror attack, if you ask me what is the priority, dealing with terror or diplomatic dialogue then the answer is obvious,\" said Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar at the Ministry of External Affairs\u2019 \u2018Raisina Dialogue\u2019 in Delhi on Tuesday. Dr. Jaishankar was referring to the Pathankot attack, but his words came within hours of the attack on the Indian mission in Jalalabad as well.\n\nDr. Jaishankar\u2019s words are significant as they explain the delay in announcing a new date for Foreign Secretary level talks with Pakistan that were due to have been held on January 14 in Islamabad, but were put off at the last minute. At the time the MEA spokesperson had said that the talks would be rescheduled in the \u201cvery near future.\u201d Mr. Jaishankar also said that the governments of India and Pakistan had remained in touch at different levels including regular telephone conversations between NSA Ajit Doval and Pakistani NSA Nasir Janjua, the Foreign secretaries, and a telephone conversation between PM Modi and PM Sharif, calling it a \u201cpicture of parallel processes.\u201d",
