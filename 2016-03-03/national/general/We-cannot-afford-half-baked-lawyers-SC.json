    "text": "Asking whether the legal profession could afford \u201chalf-baked\u201d lawyers, the Supreme Court on Wednesday favoured a pre-enrolment examination for the licence to practise law in the country.\n\nIn a case dealing with the legality of the Bar Council of India holding the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) without statutory backing, a Bench led by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur said the system was already burdened with two million advocates and \u201ccrying for reforms\u201d.\n\n\u201cJust because you have a law degree, you can\u2019t have the licence to practise. Just as you can\u2019t have half-baked doctors, how can you have half-baked lawyers? You can\u2019t start digging wells when the house is on fire. The system is crying for reforms\u201d, the Bench remarked.\n\nThe court, however, expressed reservations on the Bar Council\u2019s rule that a person should clear the AIBE within two years of his/her enrolment, saying this affected one\u2019s right to practise a profession.\n\n\u201cLet the exam go on. We are only concerned if it is in tune with the statute. We must put in a mechanism to strengthen the profession. We must see if a pre-enrolment examination will also have a salutary effect on the system already burdened with 2 million lawyers\u201d, the Bench said. \u201cSomebody puts his entire life into the hands of the lawyer. Justice itself is very valuable. We would like to have the assistance of senior advocates like Fali Nariman as amicus curiae to decide the issue.\u201d\n\nThe court agreed for a detailed hearing on Friday on a plea by the Bengaluru resident R. Nagabhushana, challenging the legality of the All India Bar Examination introduced in 2010.",
