    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday attacked the government\u2019s recently announced amnesty scheme for black money holders, mocking it as the \u201cFair and Lovely [after the fairness cream] Yojana.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during a debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to both Houses of Parliament, Mr. Gandhi said: \u201cThis Fair and Lovely Yojana is designed to turn black money into white, whereas before the elections, Mr. Modi had promised us that he would make sure that those with black money would be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nOn the Naga accord, Mr. Gandhi said Congress president Sonia Gandhi and he were both surprised that the signing of the accord was not only not discussed with chief ministers of north-eastern States but also Home Minister Rajnath Singh. \u201cAnd now, where is the accord. Gone with the wind. Bye bye accord,\u201d he said.\n\nHe exhorted the Prime Minister to \u201clisten to his colleagues in the Cabinet, the professionals in the government\u201d and to the Opposition \u201cacross the aisle.\u201d \u201cWe are not your enemies,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gandhi, whose visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) after some of its students had been charged with sedition had created misgivings in certain sections of his own party, made an eloquent case for a less muscular and monolithic version of nationalism than espoused by the ruling BJP. \u201cWhen I went to JNU, some members of the ABVP showed me black flags and abused me. I protected our national flag by allowing them the freedom to express their feelings about me,\u201d he said.",
