    "text": "After walking away from the pre-poll alliance talks for the Assembly elections in Assam last month, the BJP and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) came back to the negotiating table and said they would, in fact, be fighting polls together.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to fight the polls together,\u201d AGP leader and former Chief Minister Prafulla Mahanta said.\n\nTop sources told The Hindu that seat adjustments were settled, through marathon meetings on Tuesday, at BJP general secretary Ram Madhav\u2019s residence and at BJP president Amit Shah\u2019s home here on Wednesday.\n\nAGP president Atul Bora, who under pressure from the party earlier announced that it would go it alone, was present at both meetings. Mr. Mahanta was called for a meeting with Mr. Shah.\n\n\u201cThe number of seats is not as important as the kind of seats we have decided on,\u201d said a top source present at the meeting. He did, however, confirm that the number of seats left for the AGP in the 126-member House, was \u201cin the vicinity of 20, maybe one or two seats here and there.\u201d A formal announcement is likely on Thursday. The State unit of the BJP had been opposed to the tie-up.",
