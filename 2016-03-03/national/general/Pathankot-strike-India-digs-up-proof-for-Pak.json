    "text": "The four terrorists who attacked the Pathankot airbase on January 2 had entered India through a riverine patch in Bamiyal village along the Punjab border on the intervening night of December 30-31. After a long trek, they sat down for a meal of Shahi Paneer, Haleem, Shahi chicken, jam, cookies and Nestle milk, NIA has said.\n\nThey dug a pit and hid the food packets, each weighing 300-375 grams. At the end of the meal, the four terrorists, who were identified by India, proceeded to the Pathankot airbase. Almost two months after the attack, the National Investigation Agency has now recovered the empty packets. India has sent the details, along with other evidence gathered from the airbase, to Pakistan for corroborative evidence.\n\nPakistan's Special Investigation Team is expected to come to India around March 20",
