In case of any grievance in this regard, the Bench allowed bar owners to directly approach the Supreme Court.\n\nIt agreed with the suggestion of the bar owners to have a green room, provided the space is used in the manner in which it is understood in the \u201cclassical sense\u201d.\n\nThe Bench ordered the modified conditions to be complied within three days. Licences should be issued within ten days after compliance.",
