Freedom of expression enjoyed by every citizen can be subjected to reasonable restrictions under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution. The feelings or protest reflected in the slogans need introspection by the student community,\u201d stated the 23-page order of the Delhi High Court Bench pronounced late on Wednesday evening. While the Delhi Police, which vehemently opposed JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s bail plea, had tried to connect him with the raising of \u201canti-India slogans\u201d during the February 9 event, his counsel and senior advocate Kapil Sibal claimed that the slogans on the university campus were raised by some other people who had their faces covered. The court took strong exception to the raising of slogans by the students holding posters of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat, saying they enjoyed freedom \u201cin the comfort of university campus\u201d without realising that soldiers were defending the nation\u2019s boundaries at the highest altitude of the world in the harshest weather. The kind of slogans raised may have a demoralising effect on the families of those martyrs, said the court.",
