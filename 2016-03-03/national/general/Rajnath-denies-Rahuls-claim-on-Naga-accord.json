    "text": "Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday refuted Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s claim that he was not informed before signing a peace pact with Naga insurgent group NSCN-IM saying the statement was \u201ccompletely false and baseless\u201d and he \u201cmisled\u201d the Parliament.\n\n\u201cRahul Gandhi's statement on Naga peace accord in Lok Sabha today is completely false and baseless. I had several rounds of consultations with the PM on Naga peace process. I strongly condemn Rahul Gandhi's attempt to mislead the House,\u201d Mr. Singh tweeted.\n\nOutside the Parliament, Mr. Singh told reporters, \u201cI was in touch with the PM at various levels [regarding the Naga pact] and the allegations made by Mr. Rahul Gandhi are baseless.\u201d\n\nThe Home Minister\u2019s reaction came hours after Mr. Gandhi told the Lok Sabha that Mr. Singh was not aware of Naga peace accord which was signed in August 2015 in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe MHA in a written reply to the Lok Sabha said on Tuesday that it was only a \u201cframework agreement.\u201d\n\nMr. Gandhi launched a stinging attack in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday on Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing him of releasing Pakistan from a small \u201ccage\u201d in which it was put after the 26/11 attacks by his sudden visit to Lahore and bringing a \u201cfair and lovely\u201d scheme to launder black money.",
