But I am hoping I manage to get them to watch the 10\u2019o clock show at least,\u201d Ekta told PTI.\n\nThe producer is all set with her upcoming show Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki . She says unlike her show Naagin , which is a finite series, Kasam will not be a limited one and that she wants to keep it going only till the interest lasts. \u2014 PTI",
