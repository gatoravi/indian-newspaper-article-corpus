It followed protests by the AIADMK which raised the alleged role of former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram\u2019s son Karti Chidambaram in the scam. Reports have alleged that he had made huge investments purportedly linked to the \u201cpayoffs\u201d from this deal.\n\nMr. Karti Chidambaram had issued a statement on Tuesday saying he and his business were \u201cfully compliant with all laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nHe denied the money laundering charges.\n\n\u2018Probe not slow\u2019\n\nMr. Jaitley was unsparing, though he did not take names. \u201cWe aren\u2019t influenced by the stand of the earlier government. Investigative agencies are free to take action against whoever is found guilty. An FIR has been filed, the case will go to trial,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone suggested that investigative agencies were going slow. That is incorrect. Charge sheets have been filed and the CBI is conducting its investigations. Law will take its own course and the guilty will face justice.\u201d\n\nEarlier, AIADMK members had displayed copies of a newspaper which reported that Mr. Karti Chidambaram invested in real estate in various countries citing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities.\n\nCongress members rushed to the well of the House protesting the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow discussion on the issue.",
