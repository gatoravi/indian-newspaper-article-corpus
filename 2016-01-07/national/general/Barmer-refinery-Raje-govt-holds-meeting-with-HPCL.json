    "text": "To deliberate over points of negotiation on the stalled oil refinery project at Barmer, representatives of the Rajasthan government and the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) met here on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rs. 40,000-crore refinery project, Memorandum of Understanding for which was inked during the Congress\u2019 Ashok Gehlot government, has been facing challenges under the current BJP government. Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who didn't endorse the deal inked between the Gehlot government and the HPCL, has been renegotiating the terms for setting up the refinery.\n\nOn Wednesday, the HPCL presented its reply to the government based on the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been appointed by the State government as its consulting agency on the refinery project.\n\nAn official source present at the meeting said that the State government wanted HPCL to bring down its internal rate of return (IRR) to 12 per cent to 13 per cent, instead of the 15 percent IRR that is being targeted by the HPCL.",
