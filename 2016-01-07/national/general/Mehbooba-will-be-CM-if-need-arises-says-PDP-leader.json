There are no deliberations over a caretaker Chief Minister as of now, but Ms.Mufti is the senior leader who played an important role to shape the party. In case of any change of guard, we don\u2019t have to look around much,\u201d said Mr.Akhtar.\n\nChief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, also father of Mehbooba Mufti, has been in New Delhi\u2019s AIIMS Hospital since December 24.\n\nHe continues to suffer from severe chest infection and requires artificial respiration in the intensive care unit.\n\nHowever, the coalition partner BJP on Wednesday said it supported the idea of a Chief Minister from the PDP continuing for the entire tenure of six years.\n\nState Minister for Forests, Environment and Ecology, Bali Bhagat said: \u201cThe party\u2019s central leadership\u2019s stand to have PDP\u2019s Chief Minister will not change. We are equally worried about the health conditions of the Chief Minister. We all pray he joins back soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny stand on who should take over will be taken by the party\u2019s leadership in New Delhi,\u201d he added.",
