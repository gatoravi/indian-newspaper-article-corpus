The bearded man, wearing a \u2018khaki\u2019 coloured trousers, was spotted moving in a suspicious manner.\n\nHe was immediately detained by the security personnel, including those of the IAF, after he apparently did not respond to orders to open his bag. Aiming their guns at him, the security personnel asked him to keep the bag away and lie on the ground.\n\nThe man was then questioned by security personnel, including the Punjab Police for about 20 minutes before being taken away for further investigation. \u2014 PTI",
