    "text": "Before leaving for Europe, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi gave his go ahead to exploring the possibility of a tie-up with the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal. This, after the Kerala unit of the party nixed plans for an electoral pact with the Left Front in West Bengal that was being pushed by a certain section of the party. The Kerala unit\u2019s logic was that the party could not be rivals in one State and allies in another.\n\nThe suggestion from the Congress high command, which apparently has party president Sonia Gandhi\u2019s approval, has triggered unrest within the party\u2019s West Bengal unit. Speaking to The Hindu, senior Congress leader and Member of Parliament Adhir Ranjan Choudhary said the grassroots workers were keen on \u201cgetting rid\u201d of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), whose attitude towards the party had been \u201catrocious.\u201d \u201cInsofar as the TMC is concerned, we have vehemently opposed any kind of alliance with them,\u201d said Mr. Choudhary.\n\nMr. Gandhi\u2019s thinking of a possible alliance with the TMC is rooted in the TMC chief Mamata Banerjee\u2019s new approach toward the Congress. In the winter session of Parliament, Ms. Banerjee stood by the Gandhi family in the National Herald row and echoed the party\u2019s rhetoric on the \u201cintolerance\u201d debate.\n\nA senior Congress leader told The Hindu that the party was in a quandary in West Bengal since it has had a troubled history with the Left and the TMC. \u201cWe know that the Communists can\u2019t form a government without the Congress\u2019s support. Neither can the TMC. So we don\u2019t want to lose this edge until we figure out which side will give us a bigger share in the elections and in the government,\u201d the leader said.\n\nThe suggestion apparently has Congress chief Sonia Gandhi\u2019s approval",
