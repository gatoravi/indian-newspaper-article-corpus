    "text": "Out of power for over a decade, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav almost shifted his base to Delhi once. However, ever since his party\u2019s big comeback in the Assembly Elections late last year, he has hardly been out of Patna, apparently preoccupied governance in Bihar, particularly the departments held by his two sons.The BJP has already accused him of acting like a \u201csuper CM\u201d.\n\nWith 80 seats out of the 101 contested, the Lalu-led RJD staged a comeback in Bihar, stealing a march on alliance partners JD(U) and the Congress Party who won 71 and 27 seats respectively. In portfolio allocation, the RJD received 12 ministerial berths, including the post of the Deputy CM that went to Mr. Prasad\u2019s younger son Tejaswi Pratap Yadav.\n\nSoon after the oath-taking ceremony, secretaries of the departments held by his sons were replaced with two trusted bureaucrats of Mr. Prasad\u2019s from the days when he was the Union Railway Minister. Senior IAS officers Sudhir Kumar and R. K. Mahajan were appointed secretaries of the State Road Construction and Health departments now held by Mr. Tejaswi Yadav and his brother Mr. Tej Pratap Yadav respectively. Recently, the RJD chief hit the headlines when he made a surprise inspection at a government-run hospital and issued directives to officials and his minister-son. \u201cYes, he is my father and we\u2019ll implement his directives\u201d, Mr. Tej Pratap later told journalists.\n\nEarlier, following the murder of three engineers for extortion, Mr. Prasad advised the Nitish Kumar government to act tough on the rising crimes and also against the lunj-punj (lax and slack) policemen. He even appealed to the people to call him directly if they received any extortion or threat call.\n\nA few days back, the RJD chief summoned a Forest Department official, advising him to devise a strategy to get rid of blue bulls (Neelgai) that rampage through agricultural fields and damage crops, especially in the riverine areas. However, the official was apparently flummoxed when Mr. Prasad asked him to solve the problem without killing the animal. Asked how, Mr. Prasad reportedly told the official, \u201cYou\u2019re the forest official, you tell me how\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven police officials have started receiving direct phone calls from Mr. Prasad for favours for his party workers\u201d, a senior police official told The Hindu . The recent example, he claimed, was in Bhojpur where two groups of RJD and JD(U) supporters had a violent clash and Mr. Prasad called up the district police chief, directing him not to take any action on the incident.\n\nIf government sources are to believed, of late, several senior officials of the Nitish Kumar government were seen meeting the RJD chief at the 10, Circular Road residence \u201cfor necessary instructions and advice\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryday in the morning or late evening, these officials could be seen making entry into or exit from Mr. Prasad\u2019s residence where he currently lives with his two minister-sons\u201d, an official said.",
