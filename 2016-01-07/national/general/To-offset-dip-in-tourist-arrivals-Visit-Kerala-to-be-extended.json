Anil Kumar on Tuesday. The meeting with industry stakeholders was called to discuss steps to overcome the crisis in view of the drop in tourist arrivals to the State from Europe.\n\nThe initiative, which includes events ranging from arts to sports under the slogan Season of Surprises to promote God\u2019s Own Country and niche tourism products, would go on for another year, Principal Secretary, Tourism, G. Kamala Vardhana Rao told The Hindu here.\n\nNeed to shift focus?\n\nThe tourism authorities are yet to take a call on whether there is any need to shift the focus from Ayurveda, festivals, cuisine, Responsible Tourism, Spice Route, Muziris Heritage, and new destinations.\n\nThe decision also comes in the wake of the not-so encouraging response to the marketing drive and criticism from stakeholders that the initiative was launched last year without adequate ground work.\n\nTo know the pulse of the market, meetings would be held with the stakeholders on the first Wednesday of every month, it was decided at the meeting.\n\nNew markets\n\nTo offset the dip in arrivals, the department will explore new markets and explore China and the United States more. Three roadshows will be held in China in the coming months.",
