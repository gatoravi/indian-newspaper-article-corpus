Training the Swayamsevaks with the new set of instruments will begin in Bengaluru on Thursday.\n\nThe Ghosh has been played along with Patha Sanchalan (route marches) since 1974 with six instruments. The addition of more instruments now, insiders say, is part of a larger attempt to \u201cre-invent\u201d the Sangh in keeping with the changing times. The band will get louder in keeping with the \u201cincrease in the number of Ganaveshadhari (uniformed) Swayamsevaks participating in events,\u201d claimed Chandrashekara Jagirdar, the head of Ghosh from Karnataka.\n\nThe ensemble hitherto included small drums (Anaka), big drums (Panava), bugle (Shankha), flute (Vamshi), triangle (Tribhuja) and cymbals (Jhallari). It will now add on brass band musical instruments including saxaphone (Naganga), clarionate (Swarad), ephonimum (Gomukha), trumpet (Turya) and other instruments, which amplifies the sound. \u201cGhosh swamyamsevaks are being trained in these new instruments,\u201d he said.\n\nThe purpose of the Shibir (workshop) in Bengaluru starting Thursday, according to Rajesh Padmar, senior sangh functionary, is to enhance the quality of the Marshal Band. Ghosh national expert Anil Oak will participate in the four-day Swaranjali Akhila Bharatiya Shrung Ghosh (brass band). Those getting trained here will, in turn, train others all over the country.\n\nIt will then be standardised.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rajesh, though RSS was founded in 1925, Ghosh was introduced in 1927. The band was reinvented with the help of Carnatic and Hindustani ragas in 1974.",
