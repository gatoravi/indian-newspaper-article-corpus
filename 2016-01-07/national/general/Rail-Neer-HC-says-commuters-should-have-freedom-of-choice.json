    "text": "The Bombay High Court on Wednesday said there should be no compromise on the quality of drinking water sold at railway stations and commuters should be able to buy brands of their choice.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices Naresh Patil and M.S. Sonak was hearing a public interest litigation by Lopesh Vohra. The plea petition said commuters could not exercise freedom of choice due to a circular issued by the railways directing contractors and caterers to put up stalls selling Rail Neer \u2014 the packaged drinking water manufactured and supplied by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation.\n\nThe PIL also questioned Rail Neer\u2019s quality and stated that the water, available only in 750 ml and one litre bottles, was substandard and contaminated and did not follow safety norms laid down by the Food Safety and Standards Authorities of India. Advocate Rui Rodrigues, appearing for the petitioner, said non-availability of other drinking water brands posed a problem to commuters.\n\nMr Rodrigues said at Mumbai Central railway station only Rail Neer was being sold.\n\nAdvocate Usha Srivastava, representing IRCTC, said, \u201cThis practice is seen only in places where there are water plants. The Railways is facing gross loss as Rail Neer bottles are lying unused at godowns.\u201d",
