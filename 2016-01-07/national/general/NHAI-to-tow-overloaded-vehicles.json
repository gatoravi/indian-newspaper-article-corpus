    "text": "The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to tow away overloaded vehicles off the roads till extra load is removed at the cost and risk of the transporters.\n\nThis will be in addition to the present penal charges of ten times the applicable fee at the toll plazas on overloaded vehicles.\n\nThis move will also significantly bring down road accidents as overloaded vehicles are one of the major contributors to fatal accidents. It will also prevent premature damage to National Highways and bring down vehicular pollution arising out of overloaded goods carriages.\n\nSo far, the NHAI toll contractors or concessionaires have not been off-loading trucks and were only charging penalty due to lack of space at toll plazas and other practical difficulties, Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways said in a press statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAs per instructions issued by NHAI, from now onwards, the overloaded vehicles will not be allowed to cross the toll plaza but will be towed away and parked at designated place at the owner or driver\u2019s risk and cost.\n\nThe vehicle will be released only after the owner or driver pays the penalty equivalent to ten times the applicable fee, undertakes to off-load the extra weight and pays NHAI charges for towing and parking at prescribed rates,\u201d the release said.\n\nIf the vehicle remains unclaimed for seven days, it will be handed over to the concerned police station, the statement further said.",
