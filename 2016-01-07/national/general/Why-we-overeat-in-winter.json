    "text": "People have evolved to have limited ability to avoid overeating, especially in winter, a University of Exeter study has found.\n\nThis is because in our past, being overweight has not posed a significant threat to survival compared to the dangers of being underweight.\n\nThe urge to maintain body fat is even stronger in winter when food in the natural world is scarce.\n\nThis explains why we enjoy eating so much at Christmas and our New Year\u2019s resolutions to lose weight usually fail.\n\n\u201cYou would expect evolution to have given us the ability to realise when we have eaten enough, but instead we show little control when faced with artificial food,\u201d said lead author Andrew Higginson.\n\nComputer modelling\n\nResearchers used computer modelling to predict how much fat animals should store, by assuming that natural selection gives animals, including humans, a perfect strategy to maintain the healthiest weight.\n\nStoring fat is an insurance against the risk of failing to find food, which for pre-industrial humans was most likely in winter.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B . \u2014 IANS",
