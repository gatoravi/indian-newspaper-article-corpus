Out of this amount, Rs 31,830 crore has been spent, i.e. 95 per cent of the amount released, which includes the States\u2019 share of Rs.1,771 crores. We are receiving a number of requests from the States for release of funds to liquidate the pending liabilities and for smooth implementation of MGNREGS during the fourth quarter of the current financial year.\u201d\n\nSocial activist Aruna Roy, associated with MKSS, told a press conference here on Wednesday that over the past few years, MGNREGS had been facing acute shortage of funds. Fund shortage had begun in the last years of the UPA II rule, and had peaked during the current NDA government when mid-year budget cuts were imposed.\n\n\u201cIt has resulted in distress for MGNREGS workers, as people did not get work as per demand and faced inordinate delays in the payment of their wages,\u201d she said, pointing out that the 12 States - Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh - had exhausted their funds and were showing a negative balance, signalling a shutting down of the programme in these States.\n\nJointly addressing the press, Jayati Ghosh and Nikhil Dey said the Central government should immediately release the additional Rs.5,000 crore promised for the programme.\n\n\u201cWe feel allocations for this year should be increased even beyond that (Rs.5,000 crore) amount, to enable workers across the country, particularly in the drought-hit States, to get the much needed respite,\u201d they said.",
