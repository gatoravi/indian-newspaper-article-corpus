    "text": "French musical giant Pierre Boulez, a prolific composer and conductor who was a keen proponent of contemporary music, has died aged 90, his family said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFor all those who knew him and who appreciated his creative energy, his artistic rigour, his openness and his generosity, his presence will remain alive and intense,\u201d the family said in a statement from the Philharmonie de Paris, which Boulez spearheaded.\n\nThe world-renowned composer and virtuoso pianist, who died on Tuesday in Baden-Baden, Germany, was considered one of the most influential voices in contemporary music since the 1950s.\n\nBoulez famously shunned the baton, always conducting with his hands.\n\nBy the end of his life, Boulez was better known and more frequently played overseas. He led the BBC Symphony Orchestra and from 1971-77 was music director of the New York Philharmonic. \u2014 AFP",
