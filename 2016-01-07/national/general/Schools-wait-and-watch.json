    "text": ": Even as the Delhi government came down heavily on private schools on the issue of nursery admission, schools have adopted a cautious approach in reacting to the government\u2019s decision.\n\nWhile some schools said they will follow the government order, others said that it is an attack on their \u201cautonomy\u201d.\n\nVarious private associations of schools have also reacted against the government decision to scrap management quota, calling it a \u201ccontempt of court\u201d as the matter is sub judice.\n\nReacting to the government decision, D.K. Bedi, principal of Apeejay Pitampura, said: \u201cOur school has always followed government decisions and will abide by this decision.\u201d\n\nAlcohon International Schools principal Ashok Sehgal said: \u201cTrying to bring any order at this stage is surprising, especially when admissions have already begun .\u201d\n\nthe govt's move is a direct intervention in our autonomy, which is granted to schools by the Constitution\n\nAshok Sehgal,Principal of Alcohon\n\nInternational Schools",
