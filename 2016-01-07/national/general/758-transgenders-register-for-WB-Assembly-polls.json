Since then their [transgender voters] numbers in the subsequent elections have gone up.\n\nWith the preparations on for the upcoming Assembly polls in West Bengal, an enthusiasm is also evident among the members of the community who are not shying away from registering their names with authorities.\n\nThe updated voter list published by Office of Chief Electoral Officer, shows that as many as 758 individuals have registered under \u201cothers\u201d category.\n\nA senior official involved in the up-gradation of the voter list, is hopeful that more voters in the \u201cother\u201d category would be included closer to the polls as the list being is updated.\n\n\u201cWe have a subcommittee to look into the matter and is in touch with the Transgender Development Board (TDB) of the State government,\u201d an official said.\n\nRanjita Sinha, a member of the TDB, who voted in the Kolkata\u2019s Municipal Corporation elections under \u201cother\u201d category sees huge scope of improvement in the area.\n\n\u201cConsidering that only 758 have been enrolled there are many who are not included in the voter list as \u2018others\u2019.\n\nThe emphasis should be sensitising the people and the representatives of the community while making such enrolment,\u201d Sinha said.",
