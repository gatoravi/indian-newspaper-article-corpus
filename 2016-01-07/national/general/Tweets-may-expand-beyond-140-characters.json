    "text": "Twitter appears ready to loosen its decade-old restriction on the length of messages in a bid to make its service appealing to a wider audience accustomed to the greater freedom offered by Facebook and other forums.\n\nCEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey telegraphed Twitter\u2019s intentions in a tweet posted on Tuesday after the technology news site Re/Code reported the company is exploring increasing its limits on text from 140 characters to as many as 10,000.\n\nMr. Dorsey made it clear that Twitter isn\u2019t wedded to the 140-character limit. He illustrated his point by posting a screenshot of a text consisting of 1,325 characters. He wrote that Twitter has already noticed that many of its roughly 300 million users have been including screenshots of lengthy texts in their tweets. He indicated Twitter is examining ways to give people more room to express themselves without polluting the service with gasbags.\n\nImposing some restraint \u201cinspires creativity and brevity. And a sense of speed. We will never lose that feeling,\u201d Mr. Dorsey pledged. At the same time, he said Twitter isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to be shy about building more utility and power into Twitter for people.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said Dorsey is probably trying to avoid a backlash among long-time Twitter users who consider the 140-character tweeting limit sacred. At the same time, he needs to respond to company shareholders pining for a bigger audience that would generate more advertising revenue. \u2014 AP",
