Other than EWS category, there will be no other quota,\u201d he added.\n\nWarning schools of stringent action in case of violations, he said the government would use all available options against erring institutions, including takeover.\n\nPrivate schools in Delhi have quotas for management, siblings, alumni and many others.\n\nIn a similar move, the government has also asked schools to scrap \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d criterion for admission.\n\nNo to discrimination\n\nSome schools have given a list of 62 such criteria to the schools including parents being vegetarians, non-smokers, government employees and other similar criterion.\n\nThe move to scrap all the arbitrary quotas has come as a big relief to parents.\n\nHowever schools have a mixed reaction to it, while some schools say that they will abide by the government orders, some hailed it as \u201csnatching the autonomy.\u201d",
