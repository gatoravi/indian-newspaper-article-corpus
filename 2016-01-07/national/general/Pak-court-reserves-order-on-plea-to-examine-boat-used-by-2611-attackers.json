Both prosecution and defence presented arguments and the court reserved its verdict,\u201d a court official told PTI.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing till January 13.\n\n\u2018Al-Fauz\u2019 is in the custody of the Pakistani authorities in Karachi, from where the 10 militants, armed with AK-47 rifles and hand-grenades, had left for India to carry out the attacks. According to the Federal Investigation Agency, the attackers used three boats, including \u2018Al Fauz\u2019, to reach Mumbai. It said the security agencies had traced the shop and its owner from where they had bought the engine and the boat and a bank and a money exchange company which they used for money transactions.\n\nAfter leaving Karachi on November 23, 2008, the militants hijacked another boat and killed four of its crew members. They allegedly forced its captain to take them close to the Indian shores. The captain was killed as the vessel reached the Mumbai coast. On November 26, the gunmen left their vessel, moored off the coast of Mumbai in inflatable boats and docked in an area of fishing shanties. They fanned out in groups to carry out the attacks that killed 166 people.\n\nNine of the gunmen were killed by Indian security officials as the attacks unfolded. The lone surviving terrorist, Ajmal Kasab, was executed in November 2012. Pakistani authorities have arrested seven LeT members involved in the planning of the attacks, including the group\u2019s operations commander, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. \u2014 PTI\n\nThe boat \u2018Al-Fauz\u2019 is in the custody\n\nof the Pakistani authorities\n\nin Karachi",
