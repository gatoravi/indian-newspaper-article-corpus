    "text": "In September last year, it seemed like a good idea for R. Revathi to go to Malaysia and work as a domestic help. Her family was in debt, and she believed going abroad and earning money there would help secure the future of her three children.\n\nBut more than three months later it\u2019s been a nightmare, her children said: first her husband died, and then her mother, and both times she was not allowed to fly back. The children were left to fend for themselves with no one else at home. Revathi\u2019s visa expired in December, and her employer was insisting on money and a replacement to send her back, her family said.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, while her children \u2014 Sriram, Shweta, and Sanjay Kumar \u2014 were consulting a lawyer, they received the news that with the help of the Indian Embassy, Revathi is due to fly back. \u201cMy mother left on September 22 on a tourist visa. She was hired through an agent, Selvaraj, to work in the home of Ezhilmani and Shanthi in Malaysia,\u201d said Shwetha.\n\n\u201cMy mother was told she would have to cook, clean and look after a baby and the salary would be 1,000 ringgits,\u201d But within a month of getting there, Revathi said she was unhappy and wanted to come back. \u201cShe was only allowed one phone call per week for three minutes. She did not have a SIM card for her mobile phone and her employer had taken her passport. She would call us in tears \u2013 she wasn\u2019t even being given proper food. But Ezhilmani had a big fight with her and said she could not go,\u201d said Shwetha.\n\nOn November 12, their father V. Raghunathan, died, said Sriram.\n\n\u201cHe used to be a tourist guide,\u201d he said. He was a heavy drinker, Shwetha said, and had been ill for a while.",
