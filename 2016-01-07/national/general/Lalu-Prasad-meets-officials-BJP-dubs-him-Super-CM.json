Senior IAS officers Sudhir Kumar and R. K. Mahajan were appointed secretaries of the State Road Construction and Health departments now held by Mr. Tejaswi Yadav and his brother Mr. Tej Pratap Yadav respectively.\n\nSurprise inspection\n\nRecently, the RJD chief hit the headlines when he made a surprise inspection at a government-run hospital and issued directives to officials and his minister-son.\n\n\u201cYes, he is my father and we\u2019ll implement his directives\u201d, Mr. Tej Pratap later told journalists.\n\nEarlier, following the murder of three engineers for extortion, Mr. Prasad advised the Nitish Kumar government to act tough on the rising crimes and also against the lunj-punj (lax and slack) policemen.\n\nHe even appealed to the people to call him directly if they received any extortion or threat call.\n\nIf government sources are to believed, of late, several senior officials of the Nitish Kumar government were seen meeting the RJD chief at the 10, Circular Road residence \u201cfor necessary instructions and advice\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryday in the morning or late evening, these officials could be seen making entry into or exit from Mr. Prasad\u2019s residence where he currently lives with his two minister-sons\u201d, an official said.\n\nReacting to Mr. Prasad\u2019s \u201cextra-constitutional\u201d moves, the BJP has accused him of acting like a \u201csuper CM\u201d.\n\n\u201cNitish Kumar may be the CM but its Lalu Prasad who is running the government from behind\u201d, alleged senior state BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.\n\nSecretaries of the departments held by his sons were replaced with Lalu's trusted bureaucrats",
