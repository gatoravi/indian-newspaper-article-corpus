The anti-animal cruelty charity PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) wants to turn the house into a museum where people can wear the skins of abused animals.\n\nNo animals will actually be harmed in the making of the \u201cempathy museum\u201d, where people would reflect on the experiences of animals used in the production of certain clothes as they tour the home used in the Oscar-winning thriller, starring Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.\n\nPETA said the house is a good place to highlight this message because it was home to the character Buffalo Bill, who imprisoned his human victims, slaughtered them and skinned their bodies to make a suit of flesh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always scouting for ways to get our message out and when we saw that the house was for sale, given the topic of the movie, we just thought it would be great to turn it into an empathy museum for all animals that were killed for their skin,\u201d said PETA spokesperson Kate Tuggle. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
