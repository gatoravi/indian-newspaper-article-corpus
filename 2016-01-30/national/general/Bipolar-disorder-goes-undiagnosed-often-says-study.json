    "text": "Nearly 10 percent of British primary care patients who were prescribed anti-depressants for depression or anxiety have undiagnosed bipolar disorder, reveals a study.\n\nResearchers from the University of Leeds in Britain found that 10 percent of a group of people aged between 16 \u2013 40 years, who were prescribed anti-depressants for depression or anxiety, had unrecognised bipolar disorder. \u201cBipolar disorder is a serious problem, with high levels of disability and the risk of suicide. When it is present in depressed patients it can easily be overlooked,\u201d said Tom Hughes, consultant psychiatrist at Leeds.\n\nThe case was found to be more common among younger patients and those who reported more severe episodes of depression, noted the researchers. People who have had symptoms of high mood (such as increased energy and confidence) often do not recognise these as noteworthy and do not report to their doctors, explained the researchers in the study published in the British Journal of General Practice . \u2014 IANS",
