    "text": "Eleven persons, all owing allegiance to the Students Federation of India (SFI), have been arrested by the City police in connection with the assault on T.P. Sreenivasan, former diplomat and vice-chairman Kerala State Higher Education Council, during a protest against the Global Education Meet at Kovalam here on Friday.\n\nAccording to City Police Commissioner G. Sparjan Kumar, while 11 of the accused were already nabbed and produced before the court, the key accused, Sarath, is absconding.\n\nSarath, district joint secretary of the SFI, allegedly slapped Mr. Sreenivasan causing him to lose balance and fall to the ground, police have found from videos of the incident, that had the other accused heckling and manhandling Mr. Sreenivasan as he tried to walk through the protest, without police protection, into the hotel.\n\nThe Assistant Commissioner (Special Branch), has been asked submit a report on the allegations that there were lapses and instances of negligence on part of the police.\n\nVideos of the incident were being examined and action would be initiated against the police personnel who were on the spot, with the videos indicating that there was some delay on part of the police in reacting while the former diplomat was being manhandled by the protestors, K. Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order), said.\n\nMany of the police personnel on the spot reportedly did not recognise Mr. Sreenivasan.\n\nBut that would not be considered an excuse, and action would be initiated against those who could have prevented the episode, police officials said.",
