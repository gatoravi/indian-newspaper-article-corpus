    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will summon all 37 Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs on February 5 and brief them of the party\u2019s plan to launch a nationwide campaign against the BJP government\u2019s alleged attempts to weaken the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).\n\nOn February 2, Mr. Gandhi will visit Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the scheme. It was in Anantapur district that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, launched the make-work scheme a decade ago.\n\n\u2018MNREGA got diluted\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter his Anantapur visit, he [Mr. Gandhi] will make a presentation for all the PCC chiefs and explain how the BJP government diluted the MGNREGA,\u201d senior Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said.\n\nMr. Gandhi\u2019s move has political undertones since the MGNREGA anniversary is likely to trigger heated exchanges between the Congress and the BJP. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the UPA\u2019s flagship programme a \u201cmonumental failure.\u201d Yet, the NDA government has decided to host an annual MGNREGA Sammelan on February 2. The government plans to felicitate the best performing States and districts. This has raised an alarm in the Congress.\n\nMr. Ramesh said it was another attempt by the Modi government to \u201cown\u201d the UPA government\u2019s policy and take credit for it.",
