The agitation has been sustained for so long because there is a well orchestrated team comprising several volunteers from the students\u2019 Joint Action Committee (JAC).\n\nAnyone who has been to the Shopcom area at the university, which is the epicentre of protests on the UoH campus will notice the information desk in a corner. Managed by students from the communication department, it is probably one of the most important organs of the JAC, as it responsible for disseminating information to the media, and anyone else who is present there.\n\nAnd who does the JAC comprise? \u201cAbout 15 members from various student bodies, including the Students Federation of India (SFI), Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), Dalit Students Front (DSF) and others, barring the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishat (ABVP),\u201d said S. Hussain, a student who has been working at the information desk ever since the protests began.\n\nThe suicide of Rohith brought together all the student bodies on the campus, as there is a common cause to protest. According to Hussain, a daily meeting of the JAC is held to decide what to do each day, and how to manage the activities. For example, when the body had given the \u2018Chalo HCU\u2019 call for January 25, volunteers were divided into groups to manage and organise the event without any hitch. The JAC members, however, were not willing to provide names of those who are part of it.",
