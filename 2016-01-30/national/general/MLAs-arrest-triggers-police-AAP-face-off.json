    "text": "The Delhi Police on Friday arrested Aam Aadmi Party MLA Mahinder Yadav for allegedly rioting, damaging public property and stopping public servants from performing their duty.\n\nThe Vikaspuri MLA was arrested while protesting on the main Nihal Vihar-Najafgarh Road against the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl.\n\nHe is the sixth AAP MLA to be arrested in the past 11 months after the AAP came to power. Earlier, Akhilesh Tripathi, Somnath Bharti, Surinder Singh, Manoj Kumar and former Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar were arrested in different cases.\n\nMr. Yadav\u2019s arrest has once again put the Delhi Police and the AAP government at loggerheads.\n\n\u201c(Prime Minister) Narendra Modi\u2019s police arrested our MLA instead of arresting the rapist. For them, safety and security of women aren\u2019t important, but how to implicate AAP legislators is priority,\u201d said AAP leader Sanjay Singh, lashing out at the police.\n\nThe police alleged that Mr. Yadav led a mob which vandalised public property and tried to burn vehicles. They also claimed that the politician and his men misbehaved with the police. After the arrest, Joint Commissioner of Police (South Western Range) Deependra Pathak said all necessary actions had been taken against the rape accused.\n\n\u201cWhile the accused was arrested by evening, much before the crowd gathered there, a rumour was floated that the police had refused to arrest him.\u201d\n\nThe protesters on Thursday blocked traffic on the outskirts of Delhi claiming that the police had not provided a copy of the FIR to the victim\u2019s family. Several persons were detained for rioting following the protests.",
