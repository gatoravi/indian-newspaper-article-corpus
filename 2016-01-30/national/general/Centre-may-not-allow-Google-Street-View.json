In 2011, Google launched Street View as a pilot project in some of the tourist sites like Qutub Minar, the Thanjavur temple, the Varanasi riverbank, the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, Nalanda University, Mysore Palace and Chinnaswamy Stadium in partnership with the Tourism Ministry.\n\nPrivacy concern\n\nStreet View allows users to have a panoramic view of places in cities, as they would look in real life. The Internet giant uses cars and bikes fitted with cameras to collect 360-degree images of a place.\n\n\u201cThe case of Street View has going back and forth between various departments of Ministries.\n\n\u201cNot all are on the same page when it comes to giving it the go-ahead. We are also looking at the stand taken by countries which have not allowed the platform,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe service was launched in 2007 in the United States, and has since expanded to other parts of the world.\n\nThe Street View imagery has run into trouble in Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Poland and the United Kingdom amid privacy concerns and data protection issues.",
