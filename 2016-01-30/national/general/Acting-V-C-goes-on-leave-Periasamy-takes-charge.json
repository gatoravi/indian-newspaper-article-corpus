Periasamy, would perform the duties of the vice-chancellor till further orders.\n\nIt was on January 24 that Prof. Vipin Srivastava assumed charge as interim V-C after the incumbent P. Appa Rao went on leave.\n\nThe campus is on the boil following the suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula on January 17. Protesting students have demanded the sacking of Prof. Appa Rao and others and opposed the appointment of Prof. Srivastava as the in-charge V-C on the grounds that he was chairman of the committee which recommended suspension of five students. He had also faced allegations of harassing a Dalit research scholar from Tamil Nadu, Senthil Kumar, who committed suicide in 2008.",
