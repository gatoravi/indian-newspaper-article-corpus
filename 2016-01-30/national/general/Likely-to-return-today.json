    "text": "The Central Crime Branch police here have registered a case in connection with the abduction of a city-based novelist, Shreekumar Varma, in Senegal. Mr. Varma\u2019s son Karthik lodged a complaint with the City Police Commissioner on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cWe registered a case and before we could start the investigation, his son told us that Mr. Varma was freed. So, further action will be taken only after he returns,\u201d a police officer said. One Ibrahim contacted Mr. Karthik and said he was also kidnapped along with his father and the abductors were demanding a ransom of \u20ac2.5 million.\n\nPolice sources said Mr. Varma was expected on Friday night or Saturday.\n\nIt is alleged that Mr. Varma was taken to a seaside hotel after being abducted. \u201cSince he came to know he wouldn\u2019t be able to meet his contact, he booked the return flight. However, it is alleged that he was purposely delayed and he missed the flight,\u201d said a source.\n\nA man named Abdul took his passport purportedly for booking flight tickets.",
