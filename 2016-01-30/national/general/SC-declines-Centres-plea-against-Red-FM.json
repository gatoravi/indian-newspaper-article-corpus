    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday declined the government\u2019s plea against a Delhi High Court decision permitting Red FM, partially owned by Sun TV Network Ltd., to participate in Phase III of FM auctions held last year.\n\nA Bench headed by Justice J.S. Khehar said a company could not be barred from participating in an auction merely on the ground that some of its shareholders were facing criminal action.\n\nThe court said the rules specifically state that security clearance could be denied only when a company or its directors faced criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry had appealed against the July 26, 2015 order of the High Court allowing Red FM to participate in the auction in July-August 2015.\n\nThe High Court had set aside the Centre\u2019s order rejecting Red FM\u2019s application on the ground that the company lacked security clearance from the Home Ministry.\n\n\u2018Clearance can be denied only when\n\na company\n\nfaces criminal proceedings\u2019",
