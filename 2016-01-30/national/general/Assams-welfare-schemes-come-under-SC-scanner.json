    "text": "The Supreme Court has pulled up the Assam government for attempting to implement multi-crore public welfare schemes for the poor without even formulating proper norms or mechanism to identify beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cElections are due in the State and what is happening? Hundreds of crores are being disbursed through welfare schemes without basic norms in place to identify the needy. How do you choose who needs the most from among the lakhs of poor in Assam?\u201d Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur asked on Thursday during a hearing.\n\n\u201cShow that scheme to the HC and get its approval. Till that is done, you should not disburse any amount. This is an election year. That is why you are proceeding to disburse funds in such a manner,\u201d the Chief Justice said.",
