If a farmer innovates in his field, he should be eligible for a doctorate in agriculture if a researcher documents his innovation. In this case too, both should be eligible for a doctorate. The idea is to make research more \u201cuseful\u201d, Mr. Kanitkar claims.\n\nThe report also suggests that Sanskrit or any other classical language be made compulsory in higher education, which means four years after the first eight years of teaching in its scheme. The classical languages available include Persian and Arabic, apart from Hebrew, Latin and Greek. \u201cThe medium of teaching in professional institutions should be either Hindi or the regional language,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe organisation is hosting an international conference on research quality in Nagpur from February 11 to 14.\n\nThe idea is to\n\nmake research more useful, says Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal",
