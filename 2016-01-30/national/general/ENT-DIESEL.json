Diesel has now revealed that he is excited to finally get an opportunity to collaborate with the Bajirao Mastani star.\n\n\u201cYou have heard some of the casting, you have heard about Deepika, who is somebody I have wanted to work with for a long time...we are going to have a blast,\u201d Diesel said.\n\n\u201cI have been dying to work with someone from Bollywood and bridge that gap, and I think there is something very multi-cultural about that, and very exciting.
