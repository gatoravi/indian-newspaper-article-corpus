The Hindu has learnt that issues regarding the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and its activities in Jammu and Kashmir would figure prominently.\n\nA week ago, J&K Governor N.N. Vohra spoke on the occasion of the foundation day of the NIA, urging the Union Home Ministry to take steps to ensure that NIA\u2019s legal framework was aligned with the State\u2019s Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) so that effective investigations of terror cases could be carried out under its purview. At that time, the PDP did not create any fuss over Mr. Vohra\u2019s statement. But now, sources said, the party leadership was figuring out a strategy to place it before the public as \u201cyet another move of the Centre to violate J&K\u2019s special status\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar said the party was yet to finalise its position on the extension of the NIA act in the State.",
