    "text": "The Chief Minister and the Speaker pitted one particular community against the other tribes and \u201cincited, provoked and funded\u201d communal politics against the Governor, referring to his \u201cAssamese roots.\u201d\n\nAs for claims that the emergency was a conspiracy hatched in New Delhi, the Centre said the loudest support for President\u2019s rule was from within the State itself.\n\nThe MHA highlighted a December 28 memorandum forwarded to it by the President\u2019s Secretariat. This document was individually signed by 34 MLAs of the 60-strong Assembly, all urging for President\u2019s rule. \u201cThe memorandum makes it clear that the CM had lost majority in the Assembly and there was serious political instability in the State,\u201d the Centre said.\n\nStating categorically that the imposition of emergency on January 26 is \u201cabsolutely legal and valid,\u201d the Centre said Governor J.P. Rajkhowa had been briefing both the President and the Vice-President of the \u201cpolitical developments\u201d throughout the period from October to December, 2015. It said the Governor\u2019s reports showed that the \u201cState was virtually being run by a minority government for several months.\u201d\n\nThe Centre said the reports portrayed a Chief Minister and a Speaker who encouraged \u201cindiscipline, lawlessness, politicking by government officials\u201d, used public platforms and rallies to \u201ccondemn\u201d and abuse the Governor and watched on as their supporters laid \u201csiege\u201d to the Raj Bhavan, without enforcing prohibitory orders or making a single arrest. All this while, the reports highlight, Arunachal Pradesh had suffered badly as a State.\n\n\u201cA war-like scenario had been observed wherein the State Cabinet itself was participating in agitations,\u201d the MHA told the court.\n\nThe Centre highlighted how the Speaker had locked out the legislators, preventing them from entering the Assembly Hall between December 15 and 18, in order to conduct a floor test of the Tuki government\u2019s majority. This was done on the basis of a \u201csource information\u201d received by the Speaker that anti-social elements would try to burn down the Assembly building.\n\n\u201cLocking of the Assembly premises amounts to locking of the Constitution of India... not to allow legislators even to visit the Assembly is subversive of the democratic set-up of the Constitution,\u201d the Centre said. The \u201cAssembly Session,\u201d which led to the passing of a no-confidence motion against the CM, was finally held at a karate training hall instead of the Assembly Hall, it said.\n\nThe Centre justified President\u2019s rule, saying the State was anyway heading towards a constitutional crisis.\n\n\u2018A war-like scenario had been observed wherein State Cabinet itself was part of agitations\u2019",
