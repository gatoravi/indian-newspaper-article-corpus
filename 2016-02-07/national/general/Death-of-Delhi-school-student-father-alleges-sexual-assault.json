If he was dead, the hospital should have covered his nose and ears also with cotton. Is there something that the school wanted the hospital to hide?\u201d asked Divyansh\u2019s father Ramheet Meena.\n\n\u201cWe fear that Divyansh was subjected to sexual assault and the school is trying to hide this fact,\u201d he added.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also echoed the parent\u2019s view and demanded that there should be a fair probe into the matter.\n\n\u201cThe observation of the parents are being ignored that the private parts of the child had cotton on them. The SDM report is indicating towards a heinous crime. And saying that he had a disorder amounts to running away from responsibilities,\u201d Mr. Sisodia told reporters here.\n\nMr. Sisodia had two days ago met the parents and assured them of co-operation in the investigation.\n\nThe aggrieved father also demanded that the licence or registration of the school be cancelled. \u201cWe are demanding a CBI probe to know how my child was able to reach that unapproachable place which is often locked and why would he crawl to reach that place,\u201d Mr. Meena added.\n\nMeanwhile, police said they were not ruling out any possibility of sexual assault even as their investigation so far had not pointed towards it.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia says\n\nthere should be\n\na fair probe",
