Sathyanarayanan met Mr. Modi during his visit to Coimbatore recently and submitted a memorandum in this regard.\n\nThe memorandum said the temple town had several shrines which were centuries old, including the globally famed Darasuram Temple besides housing ancient mutts and Veda Patasalas. Kumbakonam was a spiritual town with celebrations organised every year and a culturally rich place where music and art flourished.\n\nTaking into account all these aspects, the Centre should declare Kumbakonam a heritage town, the memorandum further said.\n\nThe committee members appealed to the Prime Minister to execute the Kumbakonam\u2013\n\nJayamkondam\u2013\n\nVriddhachalam new railway line project.\n\nIf the new line was approved and executed, it would elevate Kumbakonam as a railway junction and reduce the distance to Chennai, Tirupati, and Bengaluru by 40 km, 60 km and 100 km respectively.\n\nThe new line would prove beneficial to travellers besides boosting trade, tourism, and freight movements, it said.\n\nThe estimate for the 74.3-km new railway line had been sent and was pending approval from the Railway Board and the Railway Ministry, it further said requesting the Prime Minister to take steps to implement the project.\n\nThe committee will be organising an all-India saints\u2019 conference at Govindapuram near Kumbakonam in connection with the forthcoming \u2018Mahamaham\u2019 celebration.\n\nThe conference to be held on February 18, 19,and 20 will see the participation of matathipathis and saints from different places in the country.",
