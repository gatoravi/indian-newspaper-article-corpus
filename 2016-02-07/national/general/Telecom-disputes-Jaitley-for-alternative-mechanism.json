    "text": "Union Finance and Information & Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday underscored the need for an alternative mechanism to resolve telecom disputes because the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) got bogged down in broadcasting disputes.\n\nHe said the government was willing to look at the suggestion for creation of a separate mechanism to deal with broadcasting cases and asked the TDSAT to make an appropriate suggestion in this regard.\n\n\u201cYou have thrown up a new challenge to the entire thought process, and the challenge is that even when Acts are framed with the best of intentions, the ingenuity of lawyers and the unlimited jurisdiction of judges create a situation of a divided authority.\n\n\u201cParts of the same issue or some part of the same cause of action are pending before one authority, while some parts are pending before courts,\u201d he said at a seminar here.\n\nHowever, the TDSAT had by and large functioned well.",
