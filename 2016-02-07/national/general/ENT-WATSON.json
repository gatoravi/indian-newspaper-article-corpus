It could be a conversation or debate, a performance, a lecture or seminar, a form of outreach \u2014 or something we haven\u2019t thought of. We can imagine fascinating interactions or collaborations between them.\u201d\n\nThe actors are among nine other fellows, all chosen from what Rusbridger said was a \u201cvariety of background, callings and professions.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
