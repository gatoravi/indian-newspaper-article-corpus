(Right) Ryan and Amy Green whose five-year-old son died of cancer.\u2014 Photos: NYT\n\n\u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019, a game made in memory of a terminally ill five-year-old, withholds some of the player\u2019s agency\n\nThe \u201cextra life\u201d was a fixture of early video games, a reward for skilled players that was imbued with the language of reincarnation. Players would not say they earned additional time to play, or a bonus turn, upon reaching a certain score. They were bestowed an extra life, a new chance at existence.\n\nDeath is not so frivolous in \u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019, a video game about Joel Green, a terminally ill five-year-old, and his parents, Ryan and Amy. It is a game about a single life \u2014 one that ends and then is gone forever.\n\nThe Greens, who live in Colorado, spent the past three years making the game with a small team of artists and designers. Ryan Green, who is a programmer, quit his job to work on the project. It is based on their own lives and that of Joel, who died while the game was in development.\n\n\u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 is not the first memoir to arrive in the form of a video game, but it is probably the most ambitious.\n\n\u201cI feel like \u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 is one of those breakthrough moments,\u201d said John Sharp, a professor of games at the New School and the author of Works of Game , a book about the intersection of games and art. \u201cI think we may look back at this game and see this as a touch point, a moment of rethinking what people can do with interactivity.\u201d\n\n\u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 mixes animation and magical realism to convey the Greens\u2019 emotional state during Joel\u2019s illness. There is one dragon, but much of the game consists of re-enactments of mundanities like phone messages and hospital visits. Water fills a room as a doctor says there are no more treatments for Joel\u2019s cancer.\n\nThe game also uses documentary audio \u2014 taken from home movies as well as from Thank You for Playing , a film about the Greens that had its premiere last year at the Tribeca Film Festival. Players hear Joel\u2019s laughter, and they listen to the prayers that his parents shouted on the last night of Joel\u2019s life.\n\nThe interactions offered to the players of \u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 are relatively limited. Players mostly click to decide which part of a vignette \u2014 feeding ducks at a pond or escorting Joel through a playground \u2014 will unfold, and when to move on to the next part of the Greens\u2019 story.\n\nThe restricted controls are intentional. A go-kart race through a hospital frustrated some critics, Ryan Green said, because the unwavering speed of the go-kart is dictated by the game. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can do is steer, hopefully.\u201d\n\nWithholding some control from the player was an attempt to convey feelings of helplessness and despair. \u201cOne of the great strengths of video games is that automatically a player goes into a game expecting to have some agency,\u201d Amy Green said. \u201cAnd it felt like the perfect way to talk about cancer, because all a parent wants is to have some agency.\u201d\n\nDespite all the attention paid to \u2018That Dragon, Cancer\u2019 \u2014 podcasts, magazine articles, a documentary film, millions of YouTube views of people playing it \u2014 the game\u2019s sales in its first month have been modest.\n\nAbout 10,000 people have bought it, according to the website SteamSpy. That\u2019s a nice number for a work of creative nonfiction that arrives inside a dust jacket, but not for a three-year software project with eight people working on it. By comparison, almost 4 million people own \u2018Grand Theft Auto V\u2019 on Steam, the primary digital storefront for PC games, according to SteamSpy.\n\n\u201cI always tell people, \u2018You know those indie, artsy films that Ryan likes and no one else likes?'\u201d Amy Green said. \u201c\u2018There are video games like that.\u2019\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
