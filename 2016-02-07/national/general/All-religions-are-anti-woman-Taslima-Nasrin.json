But there are so many intolerant people in this country\u201d, she said. The Bangladeshi writer-in-exile was in Kozhikode to attend the first ever Kerala Literature Festival on Saturday.\n\nResponding to a query put forth by writer K. Sachidanandan, Ms. Nasrin wondered why secularists in India were questioning only Hindu fundamentalists, while they left Muslim fundamentalists alone. She alleged that a democracy based on pseudo-secularism was not a true democracy at all. She said that the true conflict in India was between secularism and fundamentalism, between Innovation and tradition, between humanity and barbarianism and between people who value freedom and who do not. She condemned the Dadri incident and appreciated the intellectuals in the country for their unique mode of protest.\n\nExplaining her struggles as a writer and her fight against Islamist fundamentalism in Bangladesh, Ms. Nasrin said all religions were anti-woman though distortion caused by fundamentalists added to it. \u201cYou have to keep religion separated from government. There is no need to practise 7th Century laws in the 21st Century\u201d, she said and explained how the influence of religion in law-making has caused the oppression of both Muslim and Hindu women in Bangladesh. \u201cBut in India, the condition of women is much better\u201d, she said.\n\nDemocracy based on pseudo secularism not genuine, says Bangladeshi author",
