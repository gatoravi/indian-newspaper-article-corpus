Subbulapuram village, around 50 kilometres south-west of Madurai, on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe impact was so severe that the front portion of both the vehicles were damaged beyond recognition . Police said the TNSTC bus was on its way from Tirunelveli to Kumili, while the truck was proceeding towards Ariyankaavu from Karur. The incident occurred near Gopalasamy hills located close to M. Subbulapuram.\n\nTen persons, including the bus driver R. Murugesan (35) from Veerapandi in Theni district and the truck driver identified as K. Muthukumaran (35) from Kadayanallur in Tirunelveli district were killed on the spot. Four others succumbed to the injuries at the government hospital in Tirumangalam and the Government Rajaji Hospital.\n\nSix other deceased have been identified as V.

Rathinasamy who was also injured, said the truck driver was at fault as he came on the wrong side of the curved, rather narrow road.
