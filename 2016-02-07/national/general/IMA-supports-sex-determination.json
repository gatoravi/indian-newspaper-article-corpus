    "text": "The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday came out in support of Union Minister Maneka Gandhi\u2019s suggestion to make pre-natal sex determination compulsory to check female foeticide.\n\nThe IMA said the recent statement by the Union Women and Child Development Minister indicates that a 20-year old ban on foetal sex determination may be lifted.\n\n\u201cShe referred to a point of view put forth by stakeholders before the Ministry that if each pregnancy could be registered and the sex of the foetus could be made known to the parents and if the same happens to be a female, the delivery should be tracked and recorded. However, there is no formal proposal being considered by the Ministry at this stage and this is a suggestion that needs to be debated. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) supports this viewpoint,\u201d the doctor\u2019s body said in a statement.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s suggestion that pre-natal sex determination test be made compulsory to check female foeticide evoked sharp reaction from the activists and the netizens.\n\nIndia is among the countries with the worst child sex ratio in the world.\n\nThe 2011 Census showed that the child sex ratio has dipped from 927 girls in 2001 to 919 girls in 2011.\n\nChild sex ratio is the number of girls per 1,000 boys between the age 0-6 years.\n\n\u201cThe data proves that India has an abysmal record when it comes to reining in the cases of female foeticide,\u201d said National President of IMA, Dr. S.S. Agarwal. \u2014 PTI\n\nManeka Gandhi recently suggested that foetal sex tests be made mandatory",
