RLD chief Ajit Singh told The Hindu that a committee had been set up in both parties to settle the merger.\n\nA rainbow coalition of a party to be formed with the merger of the RLD and the JDl (U) and smaller entities such as the Peace Party and the breakaway faction of the Apna Dal is being planned with the ultimate aim of roping in the Congress. \u201cThis is true, we are in talks to merge our two parties, and talking to the Apna Dal and the Peace Party to join us and persuade the Congress to forge an alliance with us in Uttar Pradesh, similar to the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in Bihar,\u201d Mr. Singh said.",
