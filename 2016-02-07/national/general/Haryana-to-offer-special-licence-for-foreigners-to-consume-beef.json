    "text": "The Haryana government is willing to create a special dispensation to enable foreigners to eat beef in the State, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said.\n\nThe State government had introduced a stringent law banning the sale and eating of beef as well as trafficking and slaughtering of cows, with rigorous imprisonment of three to 10 years for violations. President Pranab Mukherjee approved the law in November 2015.\n\nMr. Khattar said the opposition to eating beef was not about anyone in particular, but reflected the feelings of the Haryanvi society which did not want to eat it. Foreign expats working in the State could get a special licence for beef.\n\n\u201cIf we have to work out some facility for them [foreigners] to be able to [consume beef]\u2026 we will do it. It could be a special licence\u2026 [as] whatever is licensed, no one can oppose [under] the law,\u201d Mr. Khattar said. \u201cEveryone has a personal lifestyle for eating and drinking, especially those who come from abroad \u2026 we don\u2019t have any opposition to that. In fact, we are not opposing this for anyone,\u201d Mr. Khattar said.\n\nSimilar permits and licences are granted for foreign nationals by the government in Gujarat where alcohol is banned, for instance.\n\nWhile Haryana has many big-ticket foreign investments in the automobile and services sectors, it is aiming to secure new investment commitments worth Rs.1 lakh crore over the tenure of his government. Most of the investors are expected from Japan and China, according to Mr. Khattar, who just returned from Japan where he met top investors such as Suzuki. Beef is a key part of the diet in these countries.\n\n\u201cThere is no issue over that between the Japanese and us\u2026 nothing like that\u2026 That won\u2019t be a problem. They [investors] haven\u2019t raised it either,\u201d he said.",
