The Shiv Sena, however, has threatened to disrupt it.\n\nThe artist\u2019s performance will mark the concluding day of the Lucknow Mahotsav, an annual celebration of art and culture of the Awadh region, organised by the Uttar Pradesh government.\n\nThe singer landed in Lucknow on Saturday afternoon and was welcomed by Principal Secretary Navneet Sehgal even as Sena members staged a protest. Police are keeping a close eye on the Sena, which has publicly threatened to disrupt the performance, and placed the party\u2019s State chief Anil Singh under house arrest.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant case of Muslim appeasement by the Samajwadi Party. What is the need to call a Pakistani singer? There is no shortage of Muslim singers in our country. We will not tolerate a red carpet welcome for Ghulam Ali at a time when our soldiers are dying on the border and attacks like Pathankot happen,\u201d Mr. Singh told The Hindu .\n\nThe Sena leader said the party would make all efforts to disturb the Pakistani singer\u2019s programme and stage protests across the State. \u201cWe will try and stop the performance in our own style,\u201d Mr. Singh said.\n\nThe Sena has opposed the performance of Pakistani artists in India and in October 2015 forced the cancellation of Mr. Ali\u2019s programmes in Mumbai and Pune. A few days later, Mr. Ali was invited to perform in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.\n\n\u2018What is the need to call a Pakistani singer? There is no shortage of singers in our country.\u2019",
