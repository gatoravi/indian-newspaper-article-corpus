The cover page features two Mysuru-based wrestlers preparing for a bout, covered in mud, taken in the town under low light condition in a garadi (traditional gym). Beyond the Body has been edited by Nan Goldin, a well-known American photo journalist.\n\nThe wrestlers featured are Shankar Charavarthy (winner of former Dasara Kesari State-level competition for three successive years, employed with the City Armed Reserve Police) and Vinod (a former Mysore University wrestler currently pursuing masters in physical education).\n\nIt was an online article on the traditional wrestling by the city-based sports journalist C.K. Muralidharan on his website www.mysoresport.com that caught the Polish photographer\u2019s attention and made him come here 10 years ago. \u201cI introduced him to the local wrestling style, took him around the garadis ,\u201d Mr. Muralidharan, who is also an executive in the public sector BEML, said.\n\nThey visited many garadis around Mysuru. Mr. Gudzowaty returned to Poland only to fly back with equipment and gear. Accompanied by veteran wrestling coach Manjappa, Mr. Gudzowaty did a bulk of his shooting at the Gopalaswamy Garadi here.\n\nThe other projects done in coordination with Mr. Muralidharan and featured in the book include Kalaripayattu and women\u2019s boxing shot in Kerala, Yoga (with Mysore Yoga practitioners shot in Varanasi), and Urban Golf in India (shot with caddies in Mumbai and in other countries.)\n\nThe sport made it to the cover page of a book, with pictures by\n\nTomasz Gudzowaty",
