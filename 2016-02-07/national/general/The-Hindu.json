I don\u2019t know why,\u201d Depp said.\n\nWhen it came to his relationship with DiCaprio, Depp said, \u201cI tortured him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really did. He was always talking about these videos games, you know? I told you it was kind of a dark period. \u2018No, I will not give you a drag of my cigarette while you hide from your mother again, Leo.\u2019\u201d\n\nDepp also said he greatly admired DiCaprio\u2019s work ethic, even then. \u201cI\u2019d say the absolute truth is that I respect Leo a lot.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
