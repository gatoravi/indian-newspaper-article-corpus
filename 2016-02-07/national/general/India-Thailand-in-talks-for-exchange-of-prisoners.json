Ms. Mandal reportedly confessed to Thai authorities that she was used by a narcotics network covering Thailand, India and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThailand\u2019s judiciary has taken up the case of Mitu Mandal. We have sought support of Thai officials so that she can be brought back to India at the earliest,\u201d a diplomatic source told The Hindu highlighting the relevance of such cross border cases for more effective law enforcement.\n\nPrisoners exchange is one of the steps being planned in bilateral legal collaboration following two major extraditions from Thailand since January 2015.\n\nIn January 2015, Thailand handed over Jagtar Singh of Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and followed it up with the handing over of Thai gunrunner \u201cWilly Naru\u201d, Wuthikorn Naruenartwanich in December 2015.\n\nIndian officials familiar with the case said that Thailand\u2019s deportation of \u201cWilly Naru\u201d was a big confidence building step since Thailand\u2019s government led by Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha was not moved by Willy\u2019s Thai nationality and deported him to India on charges of selling arms to northeast insurgent groups.\n\nExtradition treaty\n\nThe latest plan to fast track prisoners exchange is based on the bilateral extradition treaty, 2013, and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, 2004, which provide the legal basis for negotiation to both sides. Thailand Defence Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan is expected to visit India shortly to take forward the negotiations regarding the relevant cases.\n\nSources revealed that the prisoner-swap mechanism will also be a humane step and help in returning several Thai victims of human trafficking who are in various prisons of India.",
