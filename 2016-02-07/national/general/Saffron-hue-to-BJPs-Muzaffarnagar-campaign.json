But the Ram temple finds a mention even in meetings held on the theme of rights of the backward castes. At a meeting on Friday, when several backward caste youths gave extensive speeches demanding their rights, Satyapal Singh, BJP district president, appealed to them to talk like \u201cKawad [worshippers of Lord Shiva] who do not talk about caste.\u201d. When S.P. Singh Baghel, BJP\u2019s backward morcha president, spoke about the reasons for which the BJP got 73 Lok Sabha seats in U.P., without naming Muslims, he mentioned \u201cpeople\u2019s expectation from him [Narendra Modi] that he would fix a particular community and group\u201d to loud cheers from the audience of largely backward groups.The campaign slogan of Kapil Dev, BJP candidate, raises the bogey of \u201clove jihad\u201d and its perceived theory of \u201csexual onslaught of Muslim men on Hindu women.\u201d\n\n\u201c Bahu beti ke samman me/Kapil dev maidan me [for the sake of the honour of our daughters and daughters-in-law, Kapil Dev is contesting polls],\u201d is the campaign slogan of the BJP.\n\nMr. Dev told The Hindu that \u201cdevelopment comes later, first comes the honour of our women which is facing the onslaught of a particular community.\u201d",
