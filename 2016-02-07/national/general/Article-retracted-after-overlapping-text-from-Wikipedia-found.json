The incident affirms what many in the scientific community believe is an increasing trend in plagiarism.\n\nNearly two months ago, the IJP formally retracted the article \u201cThe mystery of reincarnation,\u201d published in early 2013 by researchers A.K. Nagaraj, R.B. Nanjegowda and S.M. Purushothama, from the Department of Psychiatry, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute. \u201cIt has been reported and found that the article contains overlapping text sections from Wikipedia. Therefore, on the grounds of duplicity of text, the article in concern is being retracted,\u201d says the retraction notice published by editor of the journal, T.S. Sathyanarayana Rao.\n\nLarge chunks of the study were found to have been lifted from an older version of a Wikipedia entry on reincarnation.\n\nWhile Retraction Watch \u2014 an online portal that keeps an eye on plagiarism in scientific journals \u2014 cites two large paragraphs that have been taken from the Wikipedia page, a simple online plagiarism tool shows that at least one-fourth of the study matches with the entry. The authors of the study did not respond to numerous calls made by The Hindu .\n\n\u201cOur journal is audited by Medknow (among the largest medical open access publishers) and they pointed out the plagiarism. This process takes two years, and we took serious action once it was known \u2026 we allow for language matching of around 5 per cent, but in this case, it has exceeded that,\u201d says Mr. Rao.\n\nAsked how the article was published without checks, the editor says: \u201cThis was a supplement and did not go through the process of being reviewed by at least three peers. This is a learning process and we have strengthened our checks.\u201d\n\nHe believes that with \u201cincreasing pressure\u201d on researchers to produce studies for promotions and better opportunities, incidents of plagiarism have become \u201crabid\u201d in journals.\n\nThose in the scientific community agree, believing that Indian journals have a reputation for accepting \u201cinferior, often plagiarised\u201d material.\n\nP. Balram, former director of Indian Institute of Science, who was the editor of Current Science for nearly two decades, believes the blame lies in the quantity-over-quality approach of the University Grants Commission. \u201cPlagiarism has been slowly increasing for some years now. Instead of evaluating teachers, we judge them through API (Academic Performance Indicators). By making everything into a number, there is no evaluation of quality. Many then plagiarise thinking they can get away with it,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers from the Department of Psychiatry, Mysore Medical College, had submitted it",
