    "text": "Within hours of the end of the commercial blockade in Birgunj, the biggest trading post on the Indo-Nepal border, Nepal on Saturday declared that Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli would visit India on February 19.\n\n\u201cWe have communicated to the Ministry of External Affairs of India about the February 19 visit to Delhi by Prime Minister Oli. The communication is based on our understanding with the Ministry of External Affairs of India,\u201d Nepal\u2019s ambassador to India, Deep Kumar Upadhyay, told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Upadhyay said that the end of the blockade at Birgunj had persuaded Nepal to finally declare the date of the visit which had been under discussions since Mr.Oli became Prime Minister of Nepal in October 2015.\n\nMr.Oli\u2019s planned visit to Delhi has been a contentious issue in Nepal, especially since India had been accused of supporting the blockade in Birgunj and the rest of the border. Mr. Oli himself added to the dilemma by often making accusatory statements targeting India.\n\nThe China-Nepal economic agreements, meanwhile, added substance to the reports that the Nepal Prime Minister might choose to visit Beijing first, instead of Delhi. But Mr. Upadhyay said that Mr. Oli\u2019s plan to visit China too had been finalised and would follow shortly after the Delhi visit.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Oli will visit Beijing for the Boao meet in March,\u201d Mr. Upadhyay said.",
