Its activists were halted by security personnel well before they could reach the temple town.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Ms. Desai said discussions with the temple\u2019s trustees were \u201cfruitful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trustees were insistent that even men had been prohibited from entering the inner sanctum after 2004. But we silenced them after furnishing proof that there had been several recent instances in which men were permitted to enter the restricted area and offer worship after donating Rs. 11,111 towards temple funds,\u201d said Ms. Desai.\n\nShe said the final decision on the matter now rested on Mr. Fadnavis and that both parties would agree to the verdict given by the Chief Minister.\n\n\u201cWe eagerly hope that he [Mr. Fadnavis] will end the centuries-old discrimination,\u201d said Ms. Desai. The RBB had earlier submitted a memorandum on the issue to the Chief Minister in Pune.\n\nHowever, villagers of Shani Shingnapur are opposed to the brigade\u2019s attempts to do away with the centuries-old tradition with sarpanch Balasaheb Bankar rebuffing its argument on \u2018paid aarti.\u2019\n\nMr. Bankar and a majority of the villagers have been resolutely opposed to the idea of women entering the inner sanctum to offer worship in what they call a \u201cflagrant violation of tradition.\u201d\n\nThe brigade\u2019s aim of doing away with the 400-year-old practice has drawn the battle lines with the locals, joined by activists of rightwing groups represented by the women\u2019s wing of the ruling Shiv Sena and other outfits on the fringe-right, represented by the Sanatan Sanstha, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS) and its women\u2019s wing, the Ranragini Shakha, opposing it.",
