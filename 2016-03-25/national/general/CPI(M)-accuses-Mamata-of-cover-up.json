    "text": "Targeting West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her remarks on the Narada News sting operation, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Thursday asked whether she was an expert on video footage.\n\n\u201cShe has claimed that the footage is doctored. When did she become an expert on the matter? The Centre is also silent on the issue. I wonder why the State government is not verifying the authenticity of the footage. The verification can be done by the computer science department of any university,\u201d CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Mohd. Salim said.\n\nHe said that instead of ascertaining the authenticity of the tapes, Ms. Banerjee was accusing the man behind the sting.\n\n\u201cShe and her party are opposing any kind of probe. It is evident that she wants to cover it up and would persecute whoever wants to bring out the truth,\u201d Mr. Salim added.\n\nThe CPI(M) leader also targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the BJP acting in this matter? They are indulging in theatrics but doing nothing. In Parliament, we all saw how [Finance Minister] Arun Jaitley kept mum when the matter was raised,\u201d he said.",
