The coastal service was inaugurated last week by Bangladesh Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan.\n\nIndustry sources told The Hindu that there is a huge potential to import jute and textile products and export fertilizers, foodgrains, seafood, assembled products and project cargo. The sources said the two neighbours had a container cargo of 40,000 twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) units in 2013, 40,000 in 2014 and 62,000 in 2015.\n\nFeeder service\n\nAugmenting feeder service between the two countries will also help Tripura and its six other landlocked Sister States of Northeast to have supplies in less time by transporting cargo by road from Chittagong after building a bridge over Feni river.\n\nDelivery of containers from India, which is now routed through Colombo and Singapore, will have their delivery time reduced by two to five days with the availability of reliable feeder service.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting a huge demand for containers to Bangladesh from Kakinada,\u201d a senior official of Kakinada Container Terminal said.\n\nNeepa Paribahon, which launched the coastal shipping between India and Bangladesh, sees bright scope to strengthen bilateral ties.\n\nIntroduction of coastal shipping will trigger growth",
