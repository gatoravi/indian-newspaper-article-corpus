So I approach each film feeling like a greenhorn.\u201d\n\nAsked as to why he chose to cast the popular actors, he said his maiden film Swayamvaram had the most popular actors of that time in the lead. He thought he would be able to draw the kind of performance he wanted from the cast. \u201cI have always liked Dileep as an actor but was waiting for the right kind of role for him. You will understand this when you watch the film,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides the lead pair, the film will feature Adoor regulars like Nedumudi Venu and KPAC Lalitha, besides Vijayaraghavan, Indrans, Nandu, Srinda and Sudheer Karamana. Marathi actor Subodh Bhave will appear in a key role.\n\nBaby Mathew, who is coproduceing the venture with Adoor, said he was happy to work with a filmmaker of international standing.\n\nFor Dileep, it is a dream come true. \u201cAdoor Air was the only director I approached, asking for a role. He is a rich part of our film history and our personal pride. I want to be worthy of the role he has cast me in and am approaching the film as a blank sheet. He will sketch what he wants on it. It is going to be an exciting experience,\u201d said the actor.\n\nKavya, who had previously acted in Adoor\u2019s Nalu Pennungal , said that as a child she wanted to act in Adoor\u2019s Kathapurushan . \u201cBut I got the shock of my life when he cast me in Nalu Pennungal, and I thought it would be my only Adoor film. Cuckoo chechi [Parameswaran] shocked me a second time when she enquired if I could spare two months for this project. I\u2019m fortunate to have been asked thus,\u201d she said.\n\nI have always liked Dileep as an actor but was waiting for the right kind of role for him. You will understand this when you watch the film.\n\nAdoor Gopalakrishnan",
