A male African elephant, Timbo (47), died in the early hours of Tuesday. This elephant had been received from a German Zoo in 1976.\n\nA few days ago, a male African white rhinoceros, Bheema (49), passed away at the zoo.\n\nTimbo, one of the star attractions at the zoo because of its height and grace, was suffering from chronic arthritis.\n\nThe elephant started limping on its right hind leg since 25 days and was unable to bear weight on the affected limb.\n\n\u201cNecessary treatments had been carried out since Timbo started limping but no significant improvement was noticed,\u201d said zoo director Venkatesan.\n\nThe zoo had sought opinion from Khadri, a noted wildlife veterinarian, Jacob Cheeran, an elephant expert from Kerala, and Dhanalakshmi, Assistant Professor, Veterinary College, Shivamogga, to improve its condition.\n\nHowever, Timbo started showing contra lateral limb lameness since it bore its weight continuously on its left hind limb. Nevertheless, necessary medication and physiotherapy was continued.\n\nBut, the jumbo faced problem in bearing weight on its both hind limbs at its enclosure on Monday. On the same day around 8.30 p.m, the animal, unable to stand on its legs, was laterally recumbent on its right side.\n\nZoo veterinarians, supervisors and keepers found the animal under terrible shock and treatment to resuscitate the jumbo was immediately started, a release said.",
