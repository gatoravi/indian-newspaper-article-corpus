    "text": "Archaeologists, who scanned the grave of William Shakespeare, say they have made a startling discovery: his skull appears to be missing.\n\nThe researchers used ground-penetrating radar to explore beneath the playwright\u2019s tomb in Stratford-upon-Avon\u2019s Holy Trinity Church. \u201cWe have Shakespeare\u2019s burial with an odd disturbance at the head end and we have a story that suggests that at some point in history someone\u2019s come in and taken the skull of Shakespeare,\u201d said archaeologist Kevin Colls from Staffordshire University.\n\nMr. Colls said: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very convincing to me that his skull isn\u2019t at Holy Trinity at all.\u201d But Patrick Taylor, vicar of the church, said he was not convinced there is \u201csufficient evidence to conclude that his skull has been taken.\u201d He said there were no plans to disturb the grave to find out. \u2014 AP",
