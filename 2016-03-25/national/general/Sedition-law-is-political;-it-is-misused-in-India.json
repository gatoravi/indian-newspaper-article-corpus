Ragu\n\nFocussing on the recent events that unfolded at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy organised a panel discussion on \u2018Free Speech and Sedition in a Democracy,\u2019 touching upon the impact of sedition law on freedom of speech, in Chennai on Thursday.\n\nFormer Madras High Court judge K. Chandru, former Director-General of Police A.X. Alexander and senior advocate Sriram Panchu participated in the panel discussion, which was moderated by N. Ravi, former Editor-In-Chief, The Hindu , and Director, Kasturi and Sons Ltd.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Mr. Ravi pointed out that there were three dimensions \u2014 political, legal and public discourse \u2014 to sedition and free speech.\n\n\u201cIn a constitutional democracy and republic, do the interests of the state need such a law? Second is the legal dimension: whether the restrictive legal judicial interpretation is enough of a safeguard and whether allowing the section to remain on the statute book in itself poses the danger of misuse. And the third dimension related to public discourse on sedition and free speech where very often the wrong question is posed: Is free speech of a few more important than the security of the state? The right question should be whether a particular speech of a person poses a real threat to the security,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Chandru said that sedition law was a \u2018political law.\u2019 It was always misused by the political class. \u201cThe Supreme Court has clearly said that mere speech doesn\u2019t qualify as sedition. Sedition law is always misused in India. In Tamil Nadu, singer Kovan was booked under sedition for singing against TASMAC shops and the government,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf a law is likely to be misused, then it is an arbitrary law.\u201d\n\nWhile arguing that the policemen often \u2018go by the book\u2019 because there are adequate legal checks, Mr. Alexander said that the sedition law must remain in the penal code, but the \u2018vagueness\u2019 in the law must be avoided.\n\n\u201cThere is a clamour to remove not just the sedition law, but many other laws, including the blasphemy law, which will open up a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Panchu said only when words incite violence and disturb public order, do they amount to sedition.\n\n\u201cWe should see if the speech produces a spark to the powder keg. If it doesn\u2019t, a speech cannot be deemed sedition. So long as one doesn\u2019t contemplate, promote or incite violence, it cannot be deemed seditious,\u201d he said.",
