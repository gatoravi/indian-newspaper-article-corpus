A letter issued by the regional office of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on March 9, 2016, to its head office has stated that the VCA had no EC from the State, and consent to operate from the MPCB.\n\n\u201cIt has recommended legal action against the VCA,\u201d said the petition, filed by Arun Wankar of Jai Javan Jai Kisan, Ankita Shah, a law student, and Toram Naidu, an RTI activist.\n\n\u201cThe VCA stadium has been organising big cricket tournaments since 2008. But, the NOC from the Maharashtra Fire Service Academy was received on October 17, 2015.\u201d Advocate Asim Sarode, who is representing the petitioners, said the total built-up area of the stadium measures as 56,916.58 square metres, and hence it attracts the provisions in the Ministry of Environment and Forest\u2019s notification of 2006, as per which clearance is required for any project with built-up area of more than 20,000 square metres.\n\nThe petition has pointed out discrepancies in the built-up area submitted to the MPCB and the fire department by the VCA.\n\nThe VCA\u2019s total area is 1.28 lakh square metres of which the stadium structure measures at 51,854.58 square metres and club house at 5,057.34 square metres.\n\n\u201cThe competent authorities are supposed take over 15 per cent of the open space.
