They have double standards ... ,\u201d Dr. Rai told The Hindu . An active member with the RSS since 2005, Dr. Rai has felt alienated from the organisation since 2013 and hence has kept away from its activities.\n\nQuits over harassment\n\nDr. Rai, a medical practitioner with the M.P. government, recently quit his job to launch a political outfit, alleging that he has been harassed by the State government.\n\nMr. Rai said: \u201cI was being harassed and repeatedly transferred as I had exposed numerous scams, and hence I have decided to resign and launch a new political party that would take up the challenge to defeat the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh in the 2018 Assembly polls.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople of Madhya Pradesh are looking for a suitable alternative. My party [name yet to be finalised] will fight against corruption and would take up the cause of Dalits and farmers on priority,\u201d said Dr. Rai, adding that many honest people from various political parties were willing to join him and the party would be launched soon.\n\n\u201cA section of the Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s State unit who are dissatisfied with the AAP are already in touch with me and are willing to join my party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBI has registered at least 12 cases so far following the Supreme Court\u2019s direction to probe the Vyapam scam. Irregularities in various professional examinations and tests for government jobs conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board or \u2018Vyapam\u2019 have been unearthed. The scam allegedly involves several State government officials, former ministers and politicians. The Congress has alleged that at least 49 persons associated with the scam have died under \u201cmysterious\u201d circumstances.",
