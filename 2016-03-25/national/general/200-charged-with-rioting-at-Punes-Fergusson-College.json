CCTV and video footage of the incident were being scrutinised.\n\nThe clash on Wednesday follows a series of protests and counter-protests at the college since Tuesday when an informal meeting organised by the ABVP, called the \u2018Truth of JNU\u2019 and addressed by the unit\u2019s JNU president Alok Singh, was disrupted by Dalit students.\n\nCollege principal R.G. Pardeshi had called in the police to restore order, and filed a complaint seeking the arrest of the Dalit students for raising anti-national slogans. He later withdrew the complaint.\n\nOn Wednesday, NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad visited the college in an attempt to show solidarity with the Dalit students protesting against the anti-national charge made by Mr. Pardeshi. Mr. Ahwad was heckled by BJYM activists while stones were thrown at his car after he spoke to Sujat Ambedkar, the great-grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.\n\nThe incident was condemned by NCP leaders, including MP Supriya Sule, Mr. Pawar\u2019s daughter.",
