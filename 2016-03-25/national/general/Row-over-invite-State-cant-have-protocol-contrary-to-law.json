    "text": "Printing the name of Dakshina Kannada district Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim in the invitation for Puttur Mahalingeshwara temple\u2019s annual festival in the guise of protocol is a violation of the law, claimed a devotee of the temple in his application filed before the High Court of Karnataka.\n\nMaking amendments to the pleas raised in his petition, Naveen Kulal, the petitioner, has now said that the State cannot have a protocol contrary to the law.\n\nAs the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1997, makes it mandatory that only officers professing Hindu religion could be given charge of Hindu religious institutions, the printing of Mr. Ibrahim\u2019s name even in the guise of protocol is a violation of the law, the petitioner claimed.\n\nThe State had contended that Mr. Ibrahim\u2019s name was printed as per protocol and he was not officiating as Deputy Commissioner (Hindu Charitable Institutions and Religions Endowments).\n\nIt was also argued that printing Mr. Ibrahim\u2019s name was violative of the petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights under Article 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) and Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs) of the Constitution of India.\n\nJustice A.S. Bopanna, who has been hearing the petition, permitted the petitioner to include these contentions in the plea, while adjourning further hearing.",
