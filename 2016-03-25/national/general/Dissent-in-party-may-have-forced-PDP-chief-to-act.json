    "text": "A scheduled meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti in New Delhi was called off last Saturday, despite a successful round of talks with BJP president Amit Shah.\n\nAccording to top sources, talks resumed after the intervention of an emissary from the PM\u2019s office. There were reports of arm-twisting by Ms. Mufti through posturing and hardening of positions by the BJP. However, the Modi-Mehbooba meeting on Tuesday saw a breakthrough.\n\nSources said Ms. Mufti faced a major crisis within the party, with legislators making remarks like \u201cmaking the government with or without Ms. Mufti\u201d and rebellion over facing fresh elections.\n\nThe government formation seems on course now with the PDP expecting no new negotiations on portfolios. \u201cUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that nothing had changed since Mr. Sayeed\u2019s death. We welcome the stand,\u201d PDP leader Nayeem Akhtar said.\n\nMost PDP leaders on Thursday refused to comment on the delay in government formation and progress made on Ms. Mufti\u2019s demands.",
