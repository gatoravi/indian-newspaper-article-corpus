    "text": "Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari on Thursday questioned the stand of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) in the Supreme Court that Muslim personal law was beyond the ambit of the court.\n\nThe AIMPLB made the statement in a case in which the Supreme Court is examining, on its own, the rights of Muslim women, and safeguards they might have against arbitrary divorce.\n\n\u201cCan Mohammedan Law that allows Triple Talaq be above the Indian Constitution? Are Muslim women not entitled to protection from arbitrary divorces?\u201d Mr. Tewari asked on Twitter.\n\nHe asked whether \u201cthe freedom of conscience guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution become the fig leaf to justify retrograde practices.\u201d Mr. Tewari did not elaborate when The Hindu got in touch with him, saying he had tweeted what he wanted to say.\n\nAll-Indian Congress Committee general secretary in charge of media Randeep Singh Surjewala, too, did not give a firm answer on whether this was the official stance of the party.\n\nUniform civil code\n\nWhile a Uniform Civil Code has been a core issue of the ruling BJP, the Congress has not spoken out on the matter. In 1986 however, the Rajiv Gandhi government sought to assert Muslim personal law, after the Supreme Court awarded maintenance to Shah Bano in a case of divorce, by passing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.\n\nThe AIMPLB, while countering the idea of a Uniform Civil Code in India, said the Hindu Code Bill, passed in 1956, had failed to achieve uniformity in personal law among Hindus and to expect UCC to do the same for all religious communities was not realistic.",
