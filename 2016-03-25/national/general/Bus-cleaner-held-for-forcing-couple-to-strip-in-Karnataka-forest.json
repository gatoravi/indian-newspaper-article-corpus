He had taken away their mobile phones and the woman\u2019s bag. The police tracked him after he used the woman\u2019s mobile phone to call his sister at Aregujjanahalli.\n\nHe was arrested at Madhugiri while trying to board a bus to Pavagada.\n\nMr. Chakravarthy said Bheemaraju forced the couple to undress to ensure that they could neither follow him nor seek help from the public. The police have recovered the two phones and the woman\u2019s bag from him.\n\nThe police said Bheemaraju tried to rape the woman at a secluded place. But she kicked him and tried to escape.\n\nHe caught hold of her and pushed her from a rock. After hiding in the forest the whole night, the woman sought help of villagers at Bandehalli, who gave her clothes.\n\nBheemaraju was traced by the police when he made a call using the woman\u2019s phone",
