They were let off the same day after a warning by the police and the taluk magistrate.\n\nOf the two students, one allegedly posted \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d, while another allegedly supported it.\n\nThe police took cognisance of it after a VHP activist complained to the Puttur town police on Tuesday. Krishna Prasad, Puttur block president of the VHP, complained to the police after his son, student of another college, received the screen shot of the slogan on a WhatsApp group.\n\nThe police called the two students, pursuing second year B.Com., to the police station and took them in preventive custody under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code (under which the police are authorised to make arrest to prevent commission of a cognisable offence). They were produced before the Puttur tahsildar, who released them with a direction to execute a bond of \u201cgood conduct\u201d on March 28.\n\nThe two students were having a chat in a WhatsApp group during the match. While one group was supporting the Pakistan team, the other was supporting the Indian team. During the chat, one student posted: \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d. When he was rebuked by classmates, another student came in support of the student who had posted it. One student in the group took a screen shot of the slogan and circulated it to other groups.\n\nThey were taken into custody for supporting the country during the T-20 cricket match",
