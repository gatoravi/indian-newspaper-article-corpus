    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has emphasised that he had never applied for any other citizenship ever and said there was a \u201cconspiracy\u201d hatched by the ruling BJP to malign his image.\n\nMr. Gandhi was responding to a Lok Sabha Ethics Committee notice, seeking his reply to allegations that he held British citizenship, party sources said.\n\nOn March 15, Arjun Ram Meghwal, BJP chief whip and a member of the Ethics Committee, said that the panel issued a show-cause notice to Mr. Gandhi to learn how he identified himself as British to become a director of a London-based company.\n\nMr. Gandhi responded to Mr. Meghwal\u2019s statement the same day saying, \u201cWe will deal with it [show cause notice].\u201d\n\nEver since Mr. Gandhi received the notice, Congress\u2019s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, has maintained that the reply to the notice would remain in conformity with Parliamentary procedure.\n\nSwamy\u2019s charge\n\nThe controversy over Mr. Gandhi\u2019s citizenship erupted in November 2015, when BJP leader Subramanian Swamy accused him of declaring himself a British citizen to float a firm named Backops Limited in the U.K. Dr. Swamy alleged that in the annual return form of Backops, Mr. Gandhi had declared himself to be a British national with a U.K. address to prove that claim.\n\nMr. Gandhi, according to Dr. Swamy, has 65 per cent of the total shares issued by this company.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dr. Swamy demanded that the Congress vice-president be stripped of his Indian citizenship and disqualified from Parliament.",
