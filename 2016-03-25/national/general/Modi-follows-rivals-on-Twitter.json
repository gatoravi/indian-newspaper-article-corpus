    "text": "The festival of Holi is considered an occasion when one sets aside rivalries and grudges of the past year to celebrate in a spirit of fun.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi decided to do just that on the social media platform, Twitter. From his personal handle @NarendraModi, he followed around 150 people, nearly all of them political rivals, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, party detractor Shatrughan Sinha, and constant baiter AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh.\n\nMore significantly, he followed the photo-parody account @RealHistoryPics that have not held back any punches in poking fun at the high and mighty in India, including the Prime Minister.\n\nSources in his team confirmed that nearly 150 accounts were followed by the Prime Minister, \u201cjust because of Holi\u201d and the spirit it invokes. Senior Congress leader and fellow Gujarati Ahmed Patel, former Minister Shashi Tharoor and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik are also in the list of names.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had termed Mr. Modi a \u201ccoward and psyc(h)opath\u201d on Twitter a few months ago, while it has also become a favourite medium of many politicians to put across their political statements, many of which are against Mr. Modi. By following all these leaders on Holi, may be the PM is going by the age-old Holi dictum of disregarding such leg-pulling \u2014 bura na maano, Holi hai (do not mind, it is Holi after all).\n\nRahul, Sisodia, Shatrughan Sinha and Digvijay Singh figure in the list of 150 names",
