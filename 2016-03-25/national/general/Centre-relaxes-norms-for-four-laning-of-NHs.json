    "text": "In a bid to upgrade road infrastructure, the norms for four-laning of National Highways has been brought down to 10,000 passenger car units (PCUs) from the existing 15,000 PCUs.\n\nThe daily traffic threshold also has been brought down to 6,000 PCUs in hilly areas from the current 8,000 PCUs. The relaxed norms, rolled out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), are part of the NH upgrade.\n\nHenceforth, any road connecting the national capital with State capitals and those connecting State capitals can be notified as NH stretches. The corridors connecting major ports, non-major ports, large industrial centres, tourist destinations, important hilly areas, arterial roads and roads that help open up large tracts of backward areas will also be eligible for NH status.\n\nThe Right Of Way (ROW) required for NH is 45 metres, and it should be made free of encroachments while acquiring land.\n\nStates will have to complete the land acquisition process within six months of taking up the project.\n\nMORTH is to upgrade 50,000 km of roads to NH through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and Hybrid Annuity modes. Up to 10,000 km of Greenfield NH is to be built this fiscal.\n\nMORTH has asked States to furnish lists of State highways that can be upgraded to National Highways. For the record, Rs.15,000 crore has been allocated in the Union Budget for highway expansion.\n\nThe Ministry has already released the policy paper, spelling out options for improving wayside amenities along the existing NH network and creating facilities along new corridors.\n\nThe manual of four-laning of national highways, ratified by the Indian Roads Congress, is already in place.",
