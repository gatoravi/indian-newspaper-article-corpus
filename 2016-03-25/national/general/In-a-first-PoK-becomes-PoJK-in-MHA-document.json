    "text": "For the first time ever, an official document of the NDA government has referred to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) as Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The change is significant as it is in line with the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s narrative on unified Kashmir, although it was thus far restricted to party pamphlets and manifestos.\n\nThe reference figures in the 2014-15 annual report of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which was tabled in Parliament. Under the sub-head \u201cCross LoC Trade between J&K and PoJK,\u201d the report says: Till 2015 December, 45,486 trucks have crossed over to PoJK and 28,891 trucks have crossed over to India\u2019s side through these two routes \u2014 Srinagar-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalkote routes\u2026 Security clearance has been accorded for the visits of trade delegations from J&K to PoJK.\u201d\n\nOrganiser , mouth-piece of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has on many occasions referred to PoK as PoJK and even called for freeing it from illegal occupation by Pakistan.",
