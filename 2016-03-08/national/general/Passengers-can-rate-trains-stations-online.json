There is built-in accountability as every citizen is rating with the real first and last name,\u201d said Sachin Taparia, Chairman and CEO of LocalCircles. The rating system has been rolled out after hundreds of requests from citizens. Feedback of over 10,000 citizens has already been taken by the portal in its \u2018Make Railways Better Circle\u2019 community.\n\nRailway Minister Suresh Prabhu has actively used social media platforms in the past to take feedback on train services and the performance of the Railways. The railway Budget also emphasised on passenger feedback, as it announced that a single official will be made accountable for each train\u2019s on-board experience.",
