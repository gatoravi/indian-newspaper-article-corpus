Dr. Sangay\u2019s comments came after Dorjee Tsering, a 16-year-old, set himself afire last week in protest against Chinese control of Tibet.\n\nTsering was cremated in Dharamshala on March 6, even as the exiled Tibetan community in India is preparing for the March 20 election for the exiled Tibetan legislature.\n\n\u201cThis was the first time that a teenager who has never even been to Tibet, committed self-immolation in protest. This shows that commitment to the Tibetan cause remains undiminished,\u201d Dr. Sangay said.\n\nThe self-immolation in Dehradun took place at the same time when a similar immolation took place in Tibet which, Tibetan activists say, reflect the growing disenchantment within the movement which has been nonviolent so far.\n\nOver the years, the Tibetan movement has been growing younger as the leadership issue has been left open with the Dalai Lama championing separation of the spiritual and political streams of the movement.\n\nActivists say that the self-immolation has once again underlined Tibet\u2019s right to self-determination which has been sidelined by the great power politics and the global market which need Tibet\u2019s resources for keeping the Chinese market buzzing.\n\n\u201cThe issue of Tibet is politically inconvenient for the big global powers which do not want to antagonise China. But the younger generation is restless and they are determined to take the struggle forward,\u201d said Tibetan poet and activist Tenzin Tsundue.",
