I was the first to rise and saw her [Ms. Irani] come out of her car towards us,\u201d Sandli said. \u201cSeeing my father bleeding, I begged the Minister with folded hands to help us. But she plainly refused to help,\u201d she said. She went on to say that even as she was begging for help, another car belonging to the Minister\u2019s convoy again hit her father who was trying to rise on his feet.\n\n\u201cWe lay bleeding on the road as she [the Minister] drove away. A passerby called an ambulance and we were shifted to a hospital over half-an-hour after the accident,\u201d Sandli told The Hindu .\n\nIn the FIR too, Nagar\u2019s son Abhishek has stated that Ms. Irani ignored the victims. Abhishek, though, was not present at the accident spot.\n\nThis version has been contested by the Minister\u2019s office which issued a statement that the Honda City car involved in the accident had \u201cnothing to do with the Minister\u2019s cavalcade.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather, the Minister directed the SSP, Mathura, to arrange an ambulance immediately so that the injured could be given medical treatment at the earliest (sic),\u201d the statement read.\n\nSSP Rakesh Singh told The Hindu that the owner of the Honda City car (registration number DL 3C BA 5315) was identified as Dimple Arora, a Delhi resident.\n\n\u201cThe driver had abandoned the vehicle and fled. We have sent a team to Delhi to trace the car owner,\u201d he said.",
