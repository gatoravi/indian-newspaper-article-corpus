    "text": "Students in the U.S. two to three times more often describe male professors as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d than female professors, new research has found.\n\n\u201cMale professors were described more often as \u2018brilliant\u2019 and \u2018genius\u2019 than female professors in every single field we studied \u2014\u2014 about two to three times more often,\u201d said lead researcher Daniel Storage from the University of Illinois, US.\n\nFor the study, the researchers conducted an analysis of more than 14 million reviews on RateMyProfessors.com, where students write anonymous reviews of their professors.\n\nStudents most often use the words \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d to describe male professors and in academic disciplines in which women and African\u2014Americans are underrepresented \u2014 such as philosophy and physics \u2014 the findings showed.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal PLOS ONE , included academic disciplines in the sciences, humanities, social sciences and math.\n\nThe new analysis offers new insights into students\u2019 attitudes and thoughts, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cWhat is valuable about spontaneous comments is that they provide an unvarnished reflection of how people evaluate others in their field, and what they look for in other people in that field,\u201d Andrei Cimpian, professor at University of Illinois, noted.\n\nThe study also found that none of the following four factors could fully explain the underrepresentation of women or African-Americans in a field \u2014 average GRE (graduate school entry exam) math scores, the desire to avoid long hours at work, the selectivity of each field or the ability to think systematically. \u2014 IANS\n\nStudents in U.S. use those terms two to three times more while describing male professors",
