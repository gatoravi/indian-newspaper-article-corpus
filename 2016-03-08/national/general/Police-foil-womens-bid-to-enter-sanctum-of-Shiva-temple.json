We\u2019ve been detained for no reason, we were heading to the Trimbakeshwar temple peacefully...,\u201d Ms. Desai said after her arrest. She urged Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to intervene and allow women to offer worship in the inner sanctum.\n\n\u201cWe have detained around 100 women activists,\u201d a senior police officer said.",
