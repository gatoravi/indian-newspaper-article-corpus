    "text": "A police complaint was lodged on Monday against film actor and Telugu Desam Party MLA Nandamuri Balakrishna for objectionable comments against women at the audio release function of Telugu film Savitri .\n\nA video clip of the actor, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao and brother-in-law of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, making the alleged comments went viral on social media and got largely circulated in different WhatsApp groups.\n\nWhile several persons posted comments condemning the legislator\u2019s \u2018objectionable\u2019 comment, a group of lawyers filed a complaint with the Saroornagar police station.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t specify any section of the law but the actor\u2019s remarks attract action under section 354-D introduced under the Criminal Law Amendment Act,\u201d one of the complainants told a TV news channel. However, no case was registered immediately. \u201cWe entered details of the complaint in the police station\u2019s General Diary,\u201d ACP P. Venugopala Rao said. Legal opinion was being sought, he added.\n\nThe actor\u2019s remarks resulted in a war of words between the ruling and Opposition parties.\n\nThe YSR Congress has demanded that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu and Mr. Balakrishna tender an unconditional apology. Referring to the recent incident of alleged harassment of a woman by the son of a TDP Minister, YSRC MLA R.K. Roja demanded that such Ministers be dropped from the Cabinet.\n\nActor apologises\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Balakrishna expressed regret that his remarks \u2018made in a lighter vein\u2019 were misconstrued.\n\n\u201cI have enormous respect for women and it is our family tradition to regard any woman as a member of our family. It is a trait we inherited from our father to treat women like our sisters,\u201d he said. \u201cI tender my apology if my remarks hurt any one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe video clip of the actor making the comments went viral on\n\nsocial media",
