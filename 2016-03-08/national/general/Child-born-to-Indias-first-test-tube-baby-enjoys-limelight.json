    "text": "Harsha and her baby are doing fine, says doctor\n\nBarely eight hours old, the still-to-be-named baby boy yawned, twitched his nose, sneezed, and at one point, in a sudden generous mood, smiled, sending the cameras trained on him into a tizzy. Born on Monday at 10.36 a.m. at Jaslok Hospital to India\u2019s first test tube baby Harsha, the baby boy appeared only too familiar with the media attention that his mother had generated when she was born in 1986.\n\nHarsha Chawda is India\u2019s first test tube baby, a feat that had made IVF specialist Indira Hinduja a household name in the country. So, Dr. Hinduja was the natural choice for a gynaecologist when Harsha conceived last year. \u201cI had kept in touch with her all these years. She is my second mother,\u201d Harsha told The Hindu on Monday evening.\n\nDr. Hinduja helped in the delivery of the child on Monday, 30 years after she had delivered Harsha at KEM hospital. Along with Dr. Hinduja was Dr. Kusum Zaveri \u2014 the same team that had helped deliver Harsha. Dr. Hinduja said Harsha and her baby are doing fine. \u201cWe had to do a caesarean section as the baby was presenting a breech [the head was up and the legs were down]. He is a healthy and chubby baby and weighed 3.18 kg at birth,\u201d Dr. Hinduja said.\n\nHarsha had an arranged marriage with Divyapal Shah, a businessman, last May. As he hovered around the baby in their hospital room on Monday, he said he was never worried whether Harsha will have problems conceiving.\n\nHer mother, Mani Chawda \u2014 who took Dr. Hinduja\u2019s treatment when many in the country had not even heard of assisted reproduction \u2014 said she has been in touch with her doctor all these years. Ms. Chawda, a Jogeshwari resident, said she was sure her child will lead a normal, healthy life.",
