The BJP has also questioned the \u201cinternal contradictions\u201d in the report and demanded a CBI inquiry into the riots.\n\nMs. Mayawati told Muslims in Uttar Pradesh that \u201cit is time to think and understand what value their life, property and religion hold under the SP government. It has become almost impossible for Muslims to get security \u2014 of life, property and religion \u2014 and justice under the BJP-led Centre and SP government in the State,\u201d she said, urging the minority community to accept the \u201cbitter truth\u201d and take political steps keeping them in mind.\n\nThe commission report absolved the SP government of direct responsibility for the riots that left more than 60 dead and 60,000 homeless in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining districts. It blamed the \u201cnegligence\u201d of the local administration, the \u201cfailure\u201d of the intelligence agencies and exaggerated reporting in the social and print media for the deadly violence.\n\nMs Mayawati said the report gave credence to the perception that a \u201cprobe panel\u2019s aim is not to punish the guilty and secure justice to victims but to give clean chit to governments.\u201d She condemned the report for failing to act against BJP leaders who were found \u201cprima facie guilty,\u201d and for not providing justice to victims, even as those accused of instigating the riots \u201croam free as heroes.\u201d\n\nBJP queries\n\nU.P. BJP chief and Meerut MLA, Laxmikant Bajpai, criticised the government for merely releasing a \u201cgist\u201d of the report, and said it had \u201cinternal contradictions,\u201d which needed to be clarified.\n\n\u201cThe government is patting its own back but it would not be apt to say that it has got a clean chit. The government forgets that the report has held it responsible on many counts. We demand that the full report be made available to political parties and the media,\u201d Mr. Bajpai told The Hindu .\n\n\u2018Intelligence failure\u2019\n\n\u201cThe report holds responsible the failure of the intelligence agencies and the transfers of the then DM and the SSP. It mentions that these transfers created an impression among the Hindus, especially Jats, that the government was favouring Muslims. How could have these transfers taken place without the approval of the Home department, which is under the CM?\u201d Mr. Bajpai asked.\n\nThe Sahai Commission was constituted to probe the reasons for the riots and the administrative lapses in controlling the violence. Though the report indentified 14 causes for the deadly violence, it did not indict any SP leader or senior government official or police officer.",
