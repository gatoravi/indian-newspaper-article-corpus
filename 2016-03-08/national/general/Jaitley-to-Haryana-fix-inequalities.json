If 53 per cent of the people involved in agriculture are getting just 14 per cent of the State\u2019s GDP, that itself is an indication that this is one area where investment is required, where the inequality itself has to be eliminated,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the State government to ensure composite development by expanding the network of educational institutions to the districts not close to New Delhi and improving road and rail connectivity.\n\nThe Minister told investors that Haryana had a great opportunity to attract more investments than other States \u201cnotwithstanding some transient crises.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the State has a huge sense of resilience by which it is able to overcome these crises, as it has when they took place a few weeks ago,\u201d he said, indirectly referring to the Jat agitation.\n\n\u2018Districts close to the national capital developing faster than other areas\u2019",
