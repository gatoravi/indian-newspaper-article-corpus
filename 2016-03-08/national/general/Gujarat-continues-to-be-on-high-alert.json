Thakur told media persons later.\n\nHe said the police had been carrying out search operations in coastal areas as the intelligence alert said the militants used the sea route to enter the State. \u201cWe have to take such alerts very seriously and the Central and State agencies have been coordinating to thwart the designs of terrorists,\u201d he said.",
