He also said: \u201cAll saints are anti-nationals and people should shoo them away from wherever they could be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poor should not go to temples, but should be sent to schools... Religious rituals are gimmicks which should be thrown out into the Ganga,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSuch words from a leader like Pappu Yadav are unwarranted. People of the State know his stature,\u201d senior Janata Dal (United) leader Shyam Rajak said.\n\nRashtriya Janata Dal leaders said that since he was politically isolated, he was making controversial statements to stay relevant.",
