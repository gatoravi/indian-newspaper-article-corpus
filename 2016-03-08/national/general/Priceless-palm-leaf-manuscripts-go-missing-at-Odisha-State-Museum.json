In 1984, on the occasion of the OSM\u2019s golden jubilee celebration, it was said the palm leaf manuscripts gallery had preserved more than 50,000 manuscripts covering 28 subjects.\n\nDuring the same time, the then Chief Minister J.B Patnaik, while writing foreword to Illustrated Palmleaf Manuscripts of Orissa mentioned about 50,000 manuscripts, which was corroborated by the former Chief Secretary, Subas Pani.\n\nIn 1994, K. K. Bisoi, who was then handling manuscript section, had even revealed about the presence of 60,000 manuscripts in the museum. The OSM\u2019s recent brochure says there are more than 37,000 manuscripts in the museum.\n\nThe RTI applicant, who refuses to be named, said the government had ignored several of his questions. \u201cI tried to know if the loss was due to damage or theft or just missing with or without knowledge of museum authorities. I have not been given any satisfactory answer,\u201d he said, adding the question on actual position of the unaccounted 13,000 manuscripts also went unanswered.",
