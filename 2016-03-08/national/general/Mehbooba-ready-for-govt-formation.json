    "text": "Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Monday promised to continue the alliance with the BJP but the latter asked Ms. Mufti to approach Governor N.N. Vohra with a formal support first, while describing the implementation of \u2018Agenda of the Alliance\u2019 as a \u201ccontinuous process.\u201d\n\n\u201cMufti [Muhammad Sayeed] saheb\u2019s decision [on the government formation] is final. His decision, which was well-thought, remains my decision too \u2026 Will not do anything that can prove his decision wrong,\u201d said Ms. Mufti in her public address in north Kashmir\u2019s Kupwara district on Monday.\n\nMs. Mufti\u2019s tone, for the first time, sounded reconciliatory towards the BJP, but also reflected pressure within the PDP to form the government without any further delay. However, she reiterated the need to implement the measures agreed upon in the \u2018Agenda of the Alliance\u2019.\n\nEqually ready: BJP\n\nIn response to Ms. Mufti\u2019s remarks, BJP national vice-president and MP Avinash Rai Khanna told The Hindu that his party \u201cwas equally ready\u201d for the government formation.\n\n\u201cThe alliance [between the PDP and the BJP] remains intact. We have not called it off. We never had a problem. Let Ms. Mufti first approach the Governor to formally support the alliance and her party should first elect leader of the Legislature Party.\u201d\n\nOn the PDP\u2019s demand to have confidence building measures in place before the government formation, Mr. Khanna said, \u201cThis alliance was stitched for development of J&K. So many measures, including [allocation of ] money for railway and road projects, are already taken. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Kashmir and announced a Rs. 80,000-crore package. It was all part of the confidence building measures.\u201d\n\nReiterating the BJP\u2019s commitment to the implementation of \u2018Agenda of the Alliance\u2019, Mr. Khanna said, \u201cAll measures within the Agenda are doable and its implementation is a continuous process. The governments function in continuity.\u201d",
