The volume, which is scheduled for release in May, covers January3, 2000, when the final \u2018Peanuts\u2019 strip was published the day after the death of its creator, Charles M. Schulz.\n\n\u201cFor decades, \u2018Peanuts\u2019 was our own daily security blanket,\u201d President Obama writes in his introduction. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes \u2018Peanuts\u2019 an American treasure.\u201d\n\nNo one would agree with that assessment more than Gary Groth, the president and co-founder of Fantagraphics Books, which has been publishing The Complete Peanuts since 2004. Mr. Groth wanted to make sure this volume was special, beginning with the introduction \u2014 and who was going to write it.\n\n\u201cObama was inevitably at the top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just reach for the stars. All he can do is say no.\u201d\n\nThe idea for the collected editions came to Mr. Groth in 1997, when he interviewed Schulz for The Comics Journal, a trade magazine.\n\n\u201cPreviously \u2018Peanuts\u2019 had been collected only in sporadic volumes: thematically or randomly,\u201d Mr. Groth said. \u201cMaybe someone should publish a uniform series,\u201d he recalled suggesting to Mr. Schulz. \u201cAnd that someone could be me,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Schulz resisted at first, but eventually gave his consent. Still, the project did not really take shape until after his death from colon cancer. Mr. Groth credits the cartoonist\u2019s widow, Jeannie Schulz, for cutting through the red tape involved with securing the publication rights to make the series possible.\n\nStill, a series of hardcover reprints was not a safe bet. Previous collected editions of Prince Valiant, Pogo, Popeye and others \u201cwere almost always a hard sell,\u201d Mr. Groth said. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
