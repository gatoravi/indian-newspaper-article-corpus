With more than 20,000 guests from the world over expected to converge on the Yamuna floodplains, the organisers are looking forward to the re-launch of the channel, with an advertisement push in major dailies featuring the spiritual guru with photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee.\n\nOfficials in the channel said the guru provided the road map for the channel\u2019s programming. The three-day festival to be held from March 11 will be the channel\u2019s way of making its presence felt on the digital platform, and as it readies itself, one of the chief invitees, President Pranab Mukherjee, will not be attending.\n\nAs reported in some sections of the media, the Art of Living is expecting former Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena to join the cultural extravaganza, in addition to senior Cabinet Ministers. Though the NGT has pulled up the Foundation for organising the festival on the Yamuna river bank, considered fragile and sensitive, from all appearances, including advertisements in newspapers, the event is going to be held as per schedule.\n\nA four-member committee of the NGT had found that most of the small water bodies had been filled up for the festival and natural vegetation removed. Even trees had been cut down. The floodplains of the Yamuna will also see an enormous 1,200-foot-long stage being erected. All of this, says Professor A.K. Gosain of the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Delhi, will not only destroy the floodplains but also pose a severe threat of floods on the scale witnessed in Chennai and Uttarakhand. \u201cIt raises questions about a city\u2019s attitude to the ecosystem. The DDA was party to the directive from the NGT, which tasked them with disallowing any kind of activity detrimental to the floodplains.\u201d \u201cHow did the DDA give permission to this?\u201d Mr. Gosain asked.",
