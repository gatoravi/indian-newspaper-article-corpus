    "text": "\u2018How can you give clean chit to political leaders who incited the angry mobs?\u2019\n\nMuzaffarnagar riot victims and community leaders from both Jats and Muslims, expressed their anger and disappointment with the Justice (retd) Vishnu Sahai Commission report on the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, which gave a clean chit to the Samajwadi Party government and also the political leaders, who were alleged to have played a role in inciting and abetting the communal violence.\n\nThe report blamed \u201cnegligence\u201d of the official machinery for the riots.\n\nVirendar Singh, a local BJP leader, one of the organisers of the Jat Mahapanchayat in Nagla Mandaur in September 2013, told The Hindu that the probe missed out on the political responsibility for the riots.\n\n\u201cOne must not forget that the violence aggravated when the DM and the SSP of Muzaffarnagar were transferred by the State Government. What also led to strong reaction from Jats was the biased attitude of the government during the very beginning of the violence in favour of Muslims. Who will take the blame for that?\u201d asked Mr. Singh, who faces several cases along with Union Minister of State for Agriculture Sanjeev Baliyan for organising and addressing the Mahapanchayat.\n\nMohammad Iqbal, a resident of Phugana village who lost his son Aas Mohammad in the riots, also reacted strongly to the probe panel report. He said the report had created an impression that the riots and bloodshed was \u201cspontaneous\u201d.\n\n\u2018How can you give clean chit to political leaders who incited the angry mobs?\u2019",
