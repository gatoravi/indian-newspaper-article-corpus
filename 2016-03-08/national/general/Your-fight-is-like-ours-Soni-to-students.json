It is good to see how you are all fighting for your rights. Your struggle is not very different from the tribals in Chhattisgarh,\u201d Ms. Sori told the students. \u201cWe tribals, adivasis also want azadi , we want azadi from the government oppression, from the way we are targeted by the state. We cannot sleep peacefully at night inside our houses. There is always this fear that we will be picked up by the CRPF men and framed as naxals,\u201d she said.",
