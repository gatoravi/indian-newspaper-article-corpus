Murali Kumar.\n\nGarden city\u2019s famed Ulsoor Lake became a graveyard on Monday morning. Thousands of fish were found dead, floating on the lake\u2019s waters, all victims of the early summer heat and soaring temperature. As the day progressed, they were washed onto the lake\u2019s shore.\n\nBy evening, the smell of rotting fish pervaded the air as the civic body had not yet cleared the lake.\n\nBruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials said that it would be cleared completely on Tuesday, and attributed the delay to Monday being a public holiday.\n\nFish kill in the city\u2019s lakes have almost become an annual phenomenon, during the onset of summer. \u201cIt is usually a direct result of reduced dissolved oxygen level in the water. While algae in the lake release oxygen into the water during daytime, it uses up dissolved oxygen during night time along with the fish creating a big drop in the dissolved oxygen levels. So, most fish kills are observed in early mornings,\u201d said a senior BBMP official.\n\nHowever, eco-activist Leo Saldanah, said that the practice of letting in raw sewage into the lakes exacerbates the situation.\n\n\u201cRaw sewage let into the lake will be thick during summer compared to the rainy season, leading to a higher concentration of nutrients in the lake, which also causes drop in dissolved oxygen levels. The water temperature of the lake will also shoot up, leading to such fish kills,\u201d he said. Though Ulsoor Lake in considered to be one of the more well-maintained water bodies in the city, sources said that there were multiple inlets of raw sewage into the lake.",
