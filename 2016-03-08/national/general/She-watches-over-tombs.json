For nearly five years, she has been faithfully protecting the historical \u2018Garrison Cemetery\u2019 in Srirangapatna in Mandya district.\n\n\u201cRespect the dead and understand the historical value of cemeteries of the British era,\u201d says Vidyalakshmi B.N. Venkatasubbaiah.\n\nFor nearly five years, this 75-year-old woman has been faithfully protecting the historical \u2018Garrison Cemetery\u2019 in Srirangapatna in Mandya district. She is the only woman in Karnatakawho guards a cemetery. Warriors of the Swiss de Meuron Regiment died during the fourth Anglo-Mysore War in Srirangapatna in 1799, and their families were buried here between 1800 and 1860.\n\nBeautifully and aesthetically designed tombs of different shapes and sizes were built for them.\n\nThe cemetery was crying for attention in recent years.\n\nTrouble-makers took shelter here and thieves stole iron grills and marble slabs from the tombs.\n\nLouis Dominique de Meuron, a descendant of the de Meuron Regiment, and his wife Monique developed the cemetery with the guidance of the State Archaeology Department a few years back. They hired Ms. Vidyalakshmi to guard it and pay a monthly honorarium of Rs. 8,000. \u201cWhile everyone feared entering the cemetery, I happily accepted the offer. Now, hundreds of people from all walks of life visit the cemetery every year,\u201d she says.",
