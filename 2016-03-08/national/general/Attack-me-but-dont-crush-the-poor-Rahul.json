But don\u2019t crush the poor, the weak, for whom I speak. Hit me as much you want. Speak for as long as you want to, but don\u2019t hit the poor people of the country,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said after meeting an Adivasi delegation from Chhattisgarh.\n\n\u201cTribals from Bastar met me today. They said they are facing atrocities in Bastar and that they are being threatened and crushed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country will not benefit by beating and threatening the people. You pressured Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad. Here you are pressuring Kanhaiya and our students.\u201d",
