Holding placards, one of which read \u2018Lawyers Stand With Journalists\u2019, the advocates condemned the violence.\n\nPolice initially denied permission for the march, but relented soon.\n\nPolice put up barricades just a little before the Supreme Court, forcing journalists to stop their march, but continue with their sloganeering which mainly called for Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi\u2019s head for the police inaction in the entire episode. Journalists recounted the brutality of the assault by the lawyers who did not spare even women reporters who were present at the Patiala House Courts to cover the day\u2019s proceedings.\n\nTelevision journalist Barkha Dutt said it was unacceptable that the suspects continued to roam free even though there were video clips and pictures of the incident.",
