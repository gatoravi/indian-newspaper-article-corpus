    "text": "A report prepared by the Delhi Police on the February 9 event in Jawaharlal Nehru University said: \u201cDSU members felt offended and shouted slogans in support of Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat. The Left-supported groups were shouting \u2018Bharat ki barbadi tak jang rahegi, jang rahegi, Kashmir ki aazadi tak, jang rahegi, jang rahegi\u2019 \u201d.\n\nDispersed peacefully\n\nAccording to the report, 30 to 40 ABVP activists reached the spot and started shouting slogans like \u201cBharat mata ki jai\u201d. Later, both the groups marched from Sabarmati Dhaba raising slogans against each other, and dispersed peacefully after some time.\n\nThe Delhi Police report, however, is contradictory to what eye-witnesses at the event said. According to the students, the ABVP members had a scuffle with the event organisers, mainly the Left activists. \u201cWhen the situation worsened, some of us, including Kanhaiya, shouted the December 16 movement slogans like \u2018 hum kya chahein azadi, mahilayen kya chahen azadi \u2019,\u201d a member of a Left-supported organisation at the university told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cThe Left parties, which include AISA, SFI, AISF, were never involved in shouting any kind of objectionable slogans. In fact, we were the ones trying to stop the sloganeering. We have in the past too dissociated ourselves from such sloganeering. The Delhi Police report is completely false and we are not going to accept it,\u201d said Mohit, a member of AISA.\n\nKilling celebrated\n\nThe report also mentions that the Special Branch had been keeping an eye on the activities in JNU, especially on the members of DSU. \u201cIt been has found that the group mourned Afzal Guru's death and celebrated the killing of Central Reserve Police Force personnel in anti-Naxal operations and worshipped 'Mahisasur in place of Goddess Durga' in September 2014,\u201d says the report.",
