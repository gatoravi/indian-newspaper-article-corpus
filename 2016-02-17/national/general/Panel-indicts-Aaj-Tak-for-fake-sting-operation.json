    "text": "A probe committee set up by the Uttar Pradesh government has indicted Hindi news channel Aaj Tak and its English version, Headlines Today , for promoting enmity between two groups during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots by airing a fake \u201csting operation\u201d concerning Azam Khan.\n\nIn September 2013, the television group had, through a \u201csting operation\u201d, alleged that Samajwadi Party Cabinet Minister Azam Khan had telephoned police officials to go easy on the prime accused in the molestation case in Muzaffarnagar, which proved to be the trigger for the violence.\n\nComing months before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the coverage raised questions about Mr. Khan and the SP government\u2019s \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the communal violence. The government had, however, dismissed the \u201csting operation\u201d as fake.\n\nA seven-member committee headed by SP MLA Satish Kumar Nigam on Tuesday recommended that senior journalists of the television group \u2014 Aaj Tak and Headlines Today \u2014 be charged for inciting communal disharmony during September 2013.\n\nThe 350-page report, placed in the U.P. Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday, will come up for discussion on February 23.\n\nThe flash news promoted enmity among groups and triggered the Muzaffarnagar riots",
