There was no reason to assume that the Delhi Police were incompetent to handle the case, said the court.\n\nThe petitioner had sought transfer of the probe to the NIA claiming that the police were not properly investigating the case The Bench, expressing confidence in the competence of the Delhi Police, observed that the Union government had powers to take suo motu action under the NIA Act, 2008, should it find it fit to do so.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel Hari Shankar Jain said the investigation should be handed over to the NIA as it was a sensitive matter.",
