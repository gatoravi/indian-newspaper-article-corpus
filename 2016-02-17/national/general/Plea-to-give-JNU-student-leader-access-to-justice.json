    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday admitted a petition seeking access to justice for Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Kanhaiya Kumar who is facing sedition charges.\n\nA Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur agreed to urgently hear the petition, filed by JNU alumnus N.D. Jayaprakash, on February 17.\n\nThe petition said it did not want to go into the merits of the sedition charges against Mr. Kumar. That was for the trial court to decide, though not in the kind of surcharged atmosphere seen on February 15 when the police remained a \u201cmute spectator\u201d as JNU students, their faculty and journalists covering the court proceedings were chased and beaten up in the court complex.\n\nProtest march\n\nThe hearing in the apex court coincided with a protest march to the Supreme Court by a large contingent of journalists from various media houses. They condemned the violence and demanded that they be allowed to do their duty without fear or favour.\n\nMr. Jayaprakash, represented by advocate Devadutt Kamat, said the violence on the court premises was a \u201cbrute display of force,\u201d tantamount to the \u201cgrossest of criminal contempt of court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state and the police have bounden constitutional obligation to ensure the safety and security of the citizens. The incident of 15.02.2016 is a crude affront to the rule of law and violation of Article 21 [right to life and personal liberty] of the Constitution,\u201d the petition said.\n\nIt based its contentions on the 2004 Supreme Court ruling in the Godhra riots witness Zahira Sheikh\u2019s case.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nagrees to urgently hear the petition\n\nfiled by a JNU\n\nalumnus today",
