We demand that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to probe the murder not be burdened with additional responsibilities,\u201d said Megha, Pansare\u2019s daughter-in-law.\n\nWhile Pansare succumbed to his wounds at Mumbai\u2019s Breach Candy hospital, his wife Uma, who was grievously wounded in the head, suffers from paralysis.\n\nThe first arrest in the case was made only after a lapse of seven months, after the SIT nabbed Sameer Gaikwad, an activist of the Sanatan Sanstha.",
