Joseph on Tuesday tendered an unconditional and unqualified apology before a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in a contempt of court case initiated against him for posting adverse remarks about a sitting judge on his Facebook page.\n\nThe Bench of Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Sunil Thomas initiated the contempt of court proceedings on a petition filed by Sivankutty, MLA.\n\nThough the court had directed the Minister to appear in person before the Bench to answer the memo of charges, he sought exemption from personal appearance on the ground that he had to attend the ongoing Assembly session. The court, condoning the absence of Mr. Joseph for the day, ordered him to appear in person on March 1.\n\nMr. Joseph in his affidavit said that he was ready to appear before the court any day after February 25.\n\nIn the affidavit, the Minister said that he had no intention to bring disrepute to the institution of judiciary or any judge of the High Court. The expressions used by him on his Facebook post were not intended to make \u201cany slanderous remarks about the judicial system\u201d.",
