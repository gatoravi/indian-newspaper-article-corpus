    "text": "An Interpol team is expected to hold meetings with Indian agencies to discuss whether the information furnished to seek a red-corner notice (RCN) against the former IPL chief Lalit Modi in connection with a money laundering case is sufficient.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate has obtained a non-bailable warrant against Mr. Modi for his non-appearance before the agency for questioning in the case. Based on the warrant, the ED had sought an Interpol RCN, which could help it pursue the extradition proceedings against the former IPL chief.\n\nHaving shared all details with the Interpol, the ED also sent its extradition request to the External Affairs Ministry for further action. The red-corner notice is necessary to initiate any such proceedings.\n\nThe ED is probing one money laundering case and 16 foreign exchange rule violation cases against Mr. Modi and other former office-bearers of BCCI-IPL. The money laundering case was registered in 2012 based on an FIR filed by the Chennai police in 2010.\n\nThe FIR was registered on a complaint lodged by former BCCI chief N. Srinivasan alleging cheating and embezzlement by Mr. Modi and others in the award of BCCI-IPL media rights in 2009.\n\nThe Chennai police have not yet filed a charge sheet in the case, which several government officials believe, has dealt a blow to the plans to initiate extradition proceedings against the former IPL chief.",
