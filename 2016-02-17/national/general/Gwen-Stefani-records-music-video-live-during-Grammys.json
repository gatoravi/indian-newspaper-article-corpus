In the Sophie Muller-directed live video, Stefani struts her stuff in a salon, rides on\n\na scooter and rollerblades with friends, reports usmagazine.com.\n\nThe new single was released on February 12, and the lyrics are pretty seem to be about her boyfriend Blake Shelton.\n\nThe song, penned by the 46-year-old herself, includes the lines, \u201cI was fine before I met you/ I was broken but fine/ I was lost and uncertain/ But my heart was still mine ... Now you\u2019re all I see.\u201d In the video, Shelton also gets a discreet shoutout. \u2014 IANS",
