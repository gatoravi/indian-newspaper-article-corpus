    "text": "The Supreme Court today directed the RBI to provide a list of companies, which had defaulted bank loans of over Rs. 500 crore while expressing serious concern over the rise in bad loans.\n\nA bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur asked for the list of loan defaulters to be placed before it in a sealed cover within six weeks.\n\nThe bench, also comprising Justices U.U. Lalit and R. Banumathi, wanted to know how the state-owned banks and financial institutions were advancing large-scale loans without proper guidelines and whether there was adequate mechanism to recover them.\n\nThe court made RBI party to a PIL filed in 2005 by an NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation, in which it has raised the issue of loans advanced to some companies by state-owned HUDCO.\n\nAdvocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for CPIL, submitted that about Rs. 40,000 crore of corporate debt was written off in 2015.\n\nHis submission evoked response from the bench which said that bad debts were plaguing the public sector banks. \u2014 PTI",
