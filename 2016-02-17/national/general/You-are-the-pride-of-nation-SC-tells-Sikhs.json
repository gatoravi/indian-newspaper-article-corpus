Thakur said they were no less than others and pointed to prominent personalities the Sikhs had produced in the fields of governance, literature and even judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want you to be shown as you are in less intellect than others ... but tell us what can be done within the judicial dimension ... some of your community people like Khushwant Singh has even written books on jokes,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur said.\n\n\u201cYou have given the country prime ministers like Manmohan Singh and presidents like Gyani Zail Singh. The next Chief Justice of India [Justice J.S. Khehar who is CJI-in-line as per seniority norm] is also a member of the community,\u201d the Chief Justice said.\n\nThe court was hearing petitions filed by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee and advocate Harvinder Chowdhury for a direction to stop these jokes which, they said, hurt the dignity of the Sikh community. They even suggested the court frame guidelines and order sensitisation programmes. \u201cBut even if we pass orders against the circulation of such jokes, can it be enforced? Can you stop your own colleagues from cracking jokes on you?\u201d the CJI wondered aloud.",
