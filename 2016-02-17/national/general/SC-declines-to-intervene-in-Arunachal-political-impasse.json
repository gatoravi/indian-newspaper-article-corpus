    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to intervene in the Arunachal Pradesh political controversy while the Centre indicated that it was in favour of withdrawing President\u2019s Rule in the State to make way for a new government with dissident Congress leader Kalikho Pul as Chief Minister.\n\nMr.Pul has staked his claim to form a government with the support of 31 MLAs comprising 18 Congress rebels, 11 BJP and two Independent MLAs had met Governor J.P. Rajkhowa.\n\n\u2018No report sent\u2019\n\nHowever, the Governor\u2019s counsel and senior advocate Satya Pal Jain said no report had yet been sent to the President recommending withdrawal of emergency in the State.\n\nThe Centre said that a constitutional vacuum and a state of \u201cdormancy\u201d cannot prevail in Arunachal Pradesh because the Supreme Court is testing the legality of the emergency declared on January 26. Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi assured the five-judge Bench led by Justice J.S. Khehar that even if a new government is formed, the Supreme Court could later on \u201cannul everything\u201d if it struck down the proclamation of emergency as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThere is no cloak of invincibility. Nothing is irreversible,\u201d Mr. Rohatgi submitted.\n\n\u201cBut what is your interest in this?\u201d Justice Dipak Misra asked.\n\n\u201cI am interested ultimately to revoke the President\u2019s rule and have a government sworn in. There cannot be a constitutional vacuum just because the Supreme Court is hearing the case. Nothing is irreversible. If we fail ultimately (to prove the constitutionality of the proclamation of emergency), conduct a floor test and get Mr. Tuki back,\u201d Mr. Rohatgi responded.\n\nWhen asked to counter the Centre\u2019s submissions, senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted that when President\u2019s Rule is withdrawn, the government earlier in power automatically revives.\n\nThe court said an interim way out of the crisis would be to conduct a floor test in the House",
