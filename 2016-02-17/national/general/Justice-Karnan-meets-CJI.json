Thakur in the evening after the Supreme Court rose after the day\u2019s work.\n\nThe development came 24 hours after the Supreme Court stepped in to check Justice Karnan, who on Monday passed an unprecedented \u201c suo motu judicial order staying\u201d the Chief Justice of India\u2019s recommendation to transfer him.\n\nJustice Karnan proceeded to ask the CJI to file, through his subordinates, a \u201cwritten statement\u201d by April 29 to explain the reasons for the transfer.\n\nThe judge then asked the CJI not to \u201cinterfere in my jurisdiction, as I am in the process of finalising an order on merits.\u201d\n\nActing on the urgent plea by the Madras High Court Registrar-General to restrain Justice Karnan from passing any suo motu orders, a Bench, led by Justice J.S. Khehar, stayed all administrative or judicial orders passed by Justice Karnan post February 12 \u2014 the date of his transfer recommendation.",
