He fears the police will arrest him if ever sets foot in the State again.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Mr. Kumar said the Chhattisgarh police had recorded his name in about \u201c100 charge sheets,\u201d tagging him with people who \u2014 wrongly according to him \u2014 have been dubbed \u201canti-national.\u201d\n\nHis tussle with the government began a decade ago when the UPA government launched the controversial Salwa Judum in Chhattisgarh that armed civilians with guns to neutralise Naxal insurgents. Mr. Kumar went on several \u201cfact-finding missions\u201d to find out if the State police and the Salwa Judum vigilantes were gunning down Naxalites or civilians.\n\nIn 2011, Mr. Kumar moved Supreme Court with a list of 519 cases of \u201cfake encounters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court said that all the cases must be registered and investigated by the police and compensation given to the victims\u2019 families,\u201d he said. The government, he alleges, did not take kindly to his human rights activism and \u201cbulldozed\u201d his ashram in 2009.\n\nBefore he locked horns with the State government, Mr. Kumar worked on community education, taught tribal women how to repair hand pumps and distributed free medicine in far-off villages. \u201cWe had a staff of 250, who were rendered jobless after the government bulldozed our ashram,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ongoing debate triggered by the JNU row about \u201cwho\u2019s anti-national and who\u2019s not\u201d doesn\u2019t matter to him and to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d tribal people of Chhattisgrah, he said. \u201cNo one talks about it when tribals are tossed into jails on fake charges.\u201d",
