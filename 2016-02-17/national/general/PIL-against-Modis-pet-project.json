    "text": "Gujarat High Court on Tuesday admitted a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition alleging corruption and financial irregularities in the ambitious Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) city, a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had conceived it as international financial centre during his tenure as Gujarat Chief Minister.\n\nThe multi-crore ambitious project is being implemented jointly by the Gujarat government and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), a leading infrastructure development and financial company, near the State capital Gandhinagar.\n\nThe petition has been filed by D.C. Anjaria, a former director on the board of the GIFT city, alleging massive irregularities in sale of development rights, ownership of land, recognition of income, appointment of public information officer and waste of public money.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the government-appointed board of directors failed to safeguard the interest of the public money, hence we have appealed to the court that a team should be formed to investigate the financial irregularities that have been committed,\u201d Mr. Anjaria said after the High Court Bench issued notice to the respondents. The petition has been posted for further hearing on March 15.",
