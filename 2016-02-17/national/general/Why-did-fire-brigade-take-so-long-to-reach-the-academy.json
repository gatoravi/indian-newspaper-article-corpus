    "text": "A sense of gloom pervades the Bhosale residence at Parvati here. Karishma Bhosale, 20, was one of the two students from Maharashtra who was burnt to death in a fire at the Smolensk State Medical Academy in Western Russia on Sunday.\n\n\u201cShe spoke to her mother on WhatsApp on Saturday night. The next day, after her phone could not be reached for several hours, we began to fear something bad. It is hard for us to come to terms with the fact that she is no more,\u201d said Uday Bhosale, Karishma\u2019s father.\n\nThe Dean of the Academy called them up on Sunday afternoon to convey the news.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we got a call from Smolensk since 2012 when Karishma got admission. The Dean did not share with us many details of the accident. We want more information to make sure that this is no case of negligence,\u201d he said.\n\n60 students rescued\n\nWhile nearly 60 students were rescued from the hostel, Karishma and her roommate, Pooja Kallur of Mumbai, were found dead on the fourth floor of the dormitory.\n\nKarishma, who studied at the Katariya High School, scored 92 per cent in her Class X examinations.\n\n\u201cWhy did the fire brigade take so long to reach the Academy? And why were Karishma and her roommate locked for nearly half-an-hour after the fire broke out? Why didn\u2019t the staff search for the girls, though they safely evacuated the others,\u201d asked Karishma\u2019s aunt Jyoti Malusare.",
