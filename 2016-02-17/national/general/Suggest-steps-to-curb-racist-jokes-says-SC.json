    "text": "No jokes should be targeted at any racial group, Sikh representatives on Tuesday told the Supreme Court which agreed with their suggestion that instead of an \u201cunenforceable judicial order,\u201d there was a need for sensitising the society from the formative stages.\n\nAsking various petitioners from the community including the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee to come up with suggestions in six weeks, a Bench headed by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur said it would examine the framing of guidelines to stop circulation of racist or communal jokes in the cyberworld.\n\nSenior advocates from the community, A.P.S. Ahluwalia and R.S. Suri, said there was a need to sensitise students not to circulate jokes that portrayed any community or sociological group as a \u201cbutt of jokes.\u201d\n\nThey said the community was against making and circulating of jokes on Sikhs, Biharis and calling people from north-eastern States by a particular term. \u201cThere is a need for a change in orientation. Maybe time has come to look at a bigger and larger picture,\u201d Mr. Suri said before the Bench, which comprised Justices R. Banumathi and U.U. Lalit.\n\nThe Bench said: \u201cWe can stop jokes when they are circulated for a commercial purpose. But suppose, if your [pointing out to the arguing lawyer] colleague in the canteen makes a joke, you also laugh. Can we stop him? \u201d \u2014 PTI",
