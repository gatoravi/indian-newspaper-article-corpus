    "text": "Revenue deficit of Rs. 9,000 cr highest in 5 years\n\nThe interim budget for 2016-17 presented by Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam on Tuesday showed Tamil Nadu\u2019s revenue expenditure overshooting receipts by a whopping Rs. 9,154.78 crore. The interim budget spelt out no new revenue proposals or policy measures, as the State is going to the polls in May.\n\nMr. Panneerselvam said total revenue receipts had been estimated at Rs. 1,52,004.23 crore and total revenue expenditure at Rs. 1,61,159.01 crore.\n\nThe implementation of a host of welfare schemes and a fall in the State\u2019s tax revenue, particularly driven by lower sales tax collection on petroleum products were the main reasons, explained Mr. Panneerselvam even as the Opposition parties staged a walkout.",
