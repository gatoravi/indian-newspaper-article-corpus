The last rites were performed with full military honours.\n\nThousands of mourners congregated to pay their last respects at the tiny village of Mhaskarwadi, where Suryawanshi was born.\n\nTwo months ago, the district witnessed the funeral of Col. Santosh Mahadik, commanding officer of 41 Rashtriya Rifles, who died fighting militants in Kashmir.\n\nSuryawanshi (25) is survived by his parents, his wife Rekha and his one-year-old daughter Tanuja.\n\n\u201cHe considered his posting at Siachen a dream one, as he loved the rugged outdoors and the mountains,\u201d recalled his mother Sangita. Son of poor farmers, Suryawanshi was recruited as a Sepoy in 2012 while he was only in his second year of graduation.\n\n\u201cIt would have been our third marriage anniversary last Sunday. And our daughter is having her birthday on February 19. We were looking forward to these,\u201d said Ms. Rekha.",
