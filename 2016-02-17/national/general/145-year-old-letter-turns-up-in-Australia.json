If people see this it would be interesting to have more context in relation to this record.\u201d\n\nThe letter was transferred to the archive\u2019s Brisbane office from the former Queensland Post and Telegraph Museum in 2001, but there is no information about its origin.\n\nIt came to light recently as part of a joint project between the National Archives of Australia and the Archives Nationales in France.\n\nIn the letter, which is full of fervour, the man assures his mother he is in good health.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have meat every day and when we do get some it is not very much, but we can easily get by as things are and no one in our household is complaining,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMesnier added: \u201cThe desire to repulse the Prussians is right now the solitary concern of Paris. Any suffering can be borne rather than opening the gates of the capital to them.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to speak of \u201csome real battles\u201d around the city between November 29 and December 1. \u201cWe have taken their cannon and captured 1,000 prisoners \u2014 these days of good fortune have raised the morale of the fearful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot succeed in all our attacks but I have the firm conviction, my good mother, that the ultimate success will be for our just cause.\u201d\n\nHis hopes were dashed with the city surrendering in late January 1871 after sustained bombardment. \u2014 AFP",
