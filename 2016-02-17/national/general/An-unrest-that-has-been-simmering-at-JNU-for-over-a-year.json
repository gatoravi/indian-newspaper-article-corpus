(Right) Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers Association members express solidarity outside the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s office seeking withdrawal of all the cases.\u2014 Photos: PTI & Sandeep Saxena\n\nhere is more to the ongoing unrest at the Jawaharlal Nehru University than the reports of anti-India sloganeering that became the grounds on which the police arrested its student body president, Kanhaiya Kumar, on February 12.\n\nAccording to several student accounts, the first signs of trouble on the campus came when clashes broke out between the left-leaning and right-wing student bodies on October 9, 2014 over a cartoon published in Forward Press magazine. It depicted Goddess Durga in a manner that many religious minded students found \u201cderogatory.\u201d\n\nForward Press has a reputation of being a magazine that speaks for the Dalits and has a history of triggering intense debates at JNU over a demon in the Hindu mythology named \u201cMahishasura,\u201d who is killed by Goddess Durga in a good versus evil fight. \u201cA section of leftist Dalit students considers Mahishasura a noble king,\u201d said a member of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Student Union (JNUSU). \u201cThey think it\u2019s an upper caste Brahminical construct that Mahishasura was a demon just because he was a king from a tribal area. They [the Dalit students] feel that it smacks of upper caste prejudice against the lower castes and they have often observed Mahishasura\u2019s death as the day of his martyrdom.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, the left-leaning All-India Students Federation (AISF) and the All-India Students Association (AISA) swept the polls, defeating the BJP\u2019s student wing ABVP.\n\nTwo months later, a major controversy explodes on the campus, when a student organised a \u2018havan,\u2019 lighting a fire in the middle of his hostel room to celebrate his birthday. The hostel warden, Prof. Burton Cleetus, who\u2019s a Christian, asked the student to put out the fire. \u201cThe birthday boy along with a group of ABVP activists filed a police complaint against Burton Cleetus. He levelled charges such as sexual harassment, committing atrocities against SC/ST students and hurting religious sentiments against him,\u201d said another JNUSU member, pleading anonymity.\n\nThen a month later, in December 2015, another professor, Arshad Alam, was accused of sexual assault. \u201cThe victim was a Hindu and ABVP activists spread the rumour that a Muslim professor pursuing Love Jihad ended up raping a Hindu student. They accused the leftist student parties of being anti-feminist.\u201d\n\nThe two consecutive events were soon \u201cexploited\u201d by the ABVP activists, consolidating a lot of support among the female students, said the JNUSU member.\n\nAs the controversial Afzal Guru event unfolded on February 9, the JNUSU member said they were surprised to see Home Minister Rajnath Singh condemning it. \u201cSuch events have been hosted several times in the past. The government didn\u2019t respond then. Why now?\u201d",
