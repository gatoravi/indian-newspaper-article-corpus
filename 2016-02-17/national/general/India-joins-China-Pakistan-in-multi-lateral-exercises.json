India has been invited to the exercises as an \u201cobserver plus\u201d country. This is in keeping with the recent trend of India\u2019s increasing regional interoperability with a series of multi-lateral exercises on land and sea.\n\nThe theme of the exercise, involving 35 countries, is humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The 35th edition of the exercises, considered Asia\u2019s largest multinational drill, started on January 20 and will end on February 18.\n\n\u201cTwelve personnel from the engineering and service corps are taking part in the exercises as observers,\u201d a senior official of the Defence Ministry told The Hindu .\n\nThe decision on Indian participation was conveyed to Thailand during Vice-President Hamid Ansari\u2019s visit there recently. The Thai government has said that this year, 8,564 personnel from Thailand, the U.S., Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea and other nations are playing various roles in the exercises. These exercises come in the backdrop of increased tensions over China\u2019s land reclamation in the South China Sea and informal discussions between India and the U.S. over joint naval patrols as reported by The Hindu .",
