Family members said on Tuesday that all their efforts to reach the Russian embassy in India had failed. The family, despite seeking help from MLAs and MPs, could not reach External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj who had tweeted about the fire on Monday.\n\nThe family has demanded that the Indian government should ask officials in Russia to probe the fire.\n\nThe bookworm among her siblings, 22-year-old Pooja was the youngest of seven sisters and one brother. She was a fourth year student at the academy. \u201cLast time we saw her was when she had come to attend her elder sister\u2019s wedding in July. Even when she was holidaying in India, she would join a local hospital to gain more experience. My mother is shattered,\u201d said Mayur Kallur, her 24-year-old brother.\n\nPooja\u2019s father Siddapa \u2014 who retired as manager from Air India \u2014 is waiting to hear from the Indian Embassy in Russia.\n\n\u201cThey treated us well on phone. They provided all the information and are trying to help. But we have not been given any information from the Russian Embassy in India. Even our Minister is not saying anything on this,\u201d he said.\n\nMayur Kallur said a probe was needed. \u201cThey evacuated 900 other students, but not my sister and her roommate. We were told by her friends in Russia that it is not a case of short-circuit. A water heater was used by in an adjacent room and it caught fire,\u201d he said. Mr Kallur alleged that no security system or sprinklers worked. \u201cWe paid almost Rs 6 lakh per year for her education. Can\u2019t they provide basic security measures in a hostel?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe further said that apart from a phone call from the college administration to inform them about Pooja\u2019s death, the family has not heard anything from Russia. \u201cLanguage is becoming a great barrier and now they are not picking up the phone. It seems that the college wants to cover up the tragedy,\u201d Mr. Kallur said.\n\nMeanwhile, friends and relatives of Pooja have joined hands and are planning to start a social media campaign to press for a probe. \u201cWe are coming together on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to spread the word and demand an inquiry,\u201d said Girish Kurane, 22, a family friend.",
