Kalluri had said that Hadma Batodi Kashyap, of Sunga village under the Mardoom police limits of Bastar district, was killed in a \u201cfierce encounter\u201d on February 4 and a country-made gun was recovered.\n\nHowever, Hadma Kashyap\u2019s family has said he was picked up by the police from his house early on February 3. \u201cAround 25 policemen surrounded our house. Six of them entered it and asked my husband to show them a way out of the village. When my husband refused, they gagged him and took him along with them,\u201d said Galo Kashyap, wife of Hadma.\n\nThen, Galo visited village head Sudhram Mandavi to inform him of her husband\u2019s \u201cabduction.\u201d \u201cI went to the Mardoom police station to find out the whereabouts of Hadma, but the constable told me that he was not there. I went to the station the next day too, but the police refused to say anything.\n\n\u201cOn February 5, some villagers told me that Hadma\u2019s body was seen at Maharani Hospital at Jagdalpur,\u201d Mr. Mandavi told The Hindu .\n\n\u2018No Maoist links\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was a simple farmer of our village. He had no connection with the Maoists. I can show you his Aadhaar and voter identity cards. He was also allotted a house under the Indira Awas Yojana.\u201d\n\nTribal activist and Aam Aadmi Party leader Soni Sori, who brought the family to Raipur to a media briefing, said Hadma would help villagers in times of trouble. \u201cSince he was seen as a possible leader, the police may have perceived him to be a threat. He was declared a Maoist with a reward of Rs. 1 lakh on his head. The police gave the family Rs.10,000 for the funeral. First they kill innocents and then pay for their funerals. He was a father of seven children,\u201d Soni Sori told The Hindu .\n\nBastar District Superintendent of Police R.N. Das said the allegations were an attempt to defame the police.\n\nThe family of the slain man says the police picked him up from his house on February 3",
