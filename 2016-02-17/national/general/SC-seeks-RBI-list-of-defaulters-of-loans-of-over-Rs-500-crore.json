Thakur asked the top bank to provide in six weeks the list of companies whose loans have been restructured under corporate debt restructuring schemes.\n\nDirecting that the list be placed on record in a sealed cover, the court asked how State-owned banks and financial institutions were advanc-ing huge loans without proper guidelines.\n\nThe court made RBI party to a PIL petition filed in 2005 by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) in which it raised the issue of loans advanced to some companies by State-owned Housing and Urban Development Corporation.\n\nAdvocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for CPIL, submitted that about Rs. 40,000 crore of corporate debt was written off in 2015.\n\n\u201cYou have a list of major defaulters who run empires and yet default,\u201d the Bench said.",
