The 42-year-old star injured his foot while filming an action sequence for the Ashutosh Gowariker-directed period drama.\n\n\u201cI am fine now. It happens...so it is ok,\u201d he told reporters here at the special screening of Sonam Kapoor starrer Neerja . The film has been in the pipeline for over a year now and Hrithik\u2019s injury has delayed the project further. Meanwhile, the actor heaped praise on Sonam Kapoor-starrer.\n\n\u201c[The] film is outstanding. I am so proud of this film. Sonam is incredible in the film. I have so many questions for the cast and crew how they made the film. It is a brilliant movie,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I cried so much. It is an emotional film... It hits you. Ram [Madhvani] has done a fantastic job. One should salute Shabana [Azmi].\u201d\n\n\u2014 PTI",
