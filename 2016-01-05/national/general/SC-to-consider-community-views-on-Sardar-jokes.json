    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday said it would seriously consider examining a plea to ban websites hosting jokes about Sikhs if the community has taken offence and \u201cfeels bad\u201d about them.\n\n\u201cDoes your community stand by you? If we think that your community do feel bad about it, we will seriously consider it,\u201d a Bench comprising Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justices A.K. Sikri and R. Banumathi told Harvinder Chowdhary, who had filed the petition.\n\nThe petition sought a ban on over 5,000 websites which display jokes showing the Sikh community in allegedly poor light and derogatory to it. Ms. Chowdhary even expressed reservations about jokes and outspoken comments of noted Sikh author Khushwant Singh.\n\nResponding to the Supreme Court's observation, Ms. Chowdhary said the Delhi Sikh Gurduwara Management Committee(DSGMC) has also filed a petition on the same issue and they are engaging a battery of senior advocates including Ram Jethmalani to argue the matter.\n\nWhile Ms. Chowdhary was making submissions, the Bench intervened and asked Additional Solicitor General P.S. Patwalia, also a member of the Sikh community, to express his views on the issue.\n\nThe Bench finally said that the petition would be heard along with the petition of the DSGMC.\n\nHowever, the Bench wanted to know from Ms. Chowdhary as to \u201cwho will determine that a particular joke is derogatory\u201d.",
