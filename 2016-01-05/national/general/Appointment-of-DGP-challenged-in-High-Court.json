    "text": "A writ petition was on Monday filed in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court questioning the appointment of Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) Javeed Ahmad.\n\nPetitioner Nutan Thakur, a social activist, alleged that Mr Ahmad was appointed as DGP superseding 13 IPS officers from the U.P. cadre, of whom eight are working in the State while four are on central deputation, petitioner\u2019s counsel Ashok Pandey said.\n\nThe petition, which is likely to come up for hearing on January 6, claimed that Mr Ahmad was given priority over the eight IPS officers as against the Supreme Court ruling in \u2018Prakash Singh vs Union of India\u2019 case.\n\nWhenever there is any alleged deviation from the law of the land, it sends a bad signal and sets a bad precedence, indicating \u201cquid pro quo\u201d, the petition alleged. -- PTI",
