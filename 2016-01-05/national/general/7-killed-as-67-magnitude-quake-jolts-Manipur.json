The epicentre of the quake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, was Noney in Tamenglong district, about 35 km from Imphal. Two teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were deployed in coordination with the Army and the Air Force and rapid action squads of the State Health Department were despatched to the affected areas. A round-the-clock helpline has been set up.\n\n\u201cThe epicentre is in Kabuikhullen village and Pongailong, about seven and 2 km respectively from Noney. But no one is aware of these villages which are nearly destroyed.
