In Srinagar\u2019s Saidakadal and Zadibal, tear-smoke shells were burst to disperse the protesters.\n\nHeavy deployment of security forces was made in areas having significant Shia populations in Budgam and Srinagar districts. Rainawari and Zadibal were kept out of bounds with concertina wires.\n\nMeanwhile, Shia cleric and senior separatist leader Aagha Syed Hasan appealed to the Shia community for calm.",
