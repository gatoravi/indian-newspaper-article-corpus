According to sources, those options include postponing or cancelling the talks scheduled for January 15 or holding NSA talks on the terror issue prior to the Foreign Secretaries\u2019 meeting.\n\nMaking a pitch for the talks to continue, the Pakistan government called for cooperation on fighting terrorism, adding, \u201cLiving in the same region and with a common history, the two countries should remain committed to a sustained dialogue process. The challenge of terrorism calls for strengthening our resolve to a cooperative approach.\u201d\n\nMinistry officials declined to comment on whether the statement from Pakistan was a positive step. Earlier, officials had told The Hindu that Pakistan\u2019s reaction would be closely watched, adding that a \u201cbland denial\u201d of any connection to the attack as in the past would evoke a strong reaction from India.\n\nWhile the government has not directly named any group for the attack that saw seven Indian soldiers lose their lives, officials say the Jaish-e-Mohammad is believed to be the main suspect and calls made by the terrorists that were intercepted had been made to Bahawalpur in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab.\n\nJeM leader Masood Azhar was facing terror charges in India when he was released in 1999 in exchange for passengers taken hostage on IC-814. Since then he has lived in Pakistan without any restrictions. After Pakistan\u2019s latest statement, where it condemned the Pathankot attack and expressed condolences for the death of soldiers, one Indian official told The Hindu , \u201cThese are still words. Let us see some action,\u201d indicating that India awaits a crackdown by Pakistani authorities on the group responsible for the attack.",
