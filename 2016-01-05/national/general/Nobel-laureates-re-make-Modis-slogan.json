Gross suggested that the Prime Minister\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 slogan be replaced with \u2018Discover, Invent and Make in India\u2019. Before \u2018Making in India\u2019, Prof. Gross said, there was a need to invent in India. \u201cIn order to invent in India, you should have discoveries in India,\u201d he said, adding that the country should focus on \u201cnew inventions, new technologies and new products that can compete on the world stage.\u201d\n\nWinner of the Nobel in Chemistry in 2011 Dan Schechtman continued with Prof. Gross\u2019 line of argument and stressed on innovation in India. This should be supported by entrepreneurs and start-ups, which can make products out of innovations taking place at universities and research centres, he said.\n\nProf .Gross said investment in R&D was crucial for a country to develop. Though India\u2019s economy and GDP had doubled in the last 10 years, the government\u2019s financial allocation for R&D has more or less stagnated.\n\nDespite the promises by successive Prime Ministers to increase the funding for R&D during every Indian Science Congress since the last 15 years, the growth has just been a \u201cflat curve\u201d, Prof. Gross said. In contrast, he said South Korea, China and the U.S., besides countries in Europe, were allocating more funds for R&D.\n\nMeanwhile, Prof. Schechtman said India also needs more human resources in science and engineering. If more youth are to be encouraged to take up studies in science, he urged the subject should be introduced to students at a very young age.\n\nDespite the promises by successive Prime Ministers to increase funding for R&D during every ISC over the past 15 years, the growth has just been a flat curve. \u2014 Noble laureate David J.
