I have the same fantasy.\u201d\n\nMs. Anderson, a performance artist known for incorporating new technology into her work, got her wish two years later. She and friends put on a concert for hundreds of dogs outside the Sydney Opera House, with the music emitted from speakers at a low, dog-friendly frequency. At the end, they began to bark \u2014 even the droolers in the front row. \u201cIt was a beautiful sound,\u201d she said. \u201cThey barked for five minutes. That was one of the happiest moments of my life.\u201d\n\nNow, Ms. Anderson will be hosting a concert for dogs at Duffy Square in New York on Monday night.\n\nThe occasion is the January edition of Midnight Moment, a series in which many Times Square billboards become a digital art gallery, if only for three minutes.\n\nThe series, presented by Times Square Arts and the Times Square Advertising Coalition, has in the past included works by Andy Warhol, Bjork and Yoko Ono. Anderson\u2019s contribution is a three-minute cut of her documentary Heart of a Dog \u2014 a poetic visual essay about, among other things, the journey from life to the afterlife.\n\n\u201cHeart of a Dog,\u201d which has been shortlisted for an Academy Award nomination, is about 75 minutes long.\n\nThe Midnight Moment\u2019s three-minute edit, Anderson said, homes in on the bardo, the journey into the afterlife as depicted in The Tibetan Book of the Dead . The bardo, Ms. Anderson said, is the heart of the film, and it lent itself well to the time constraints of the Midnight Moment.\n\n\u201cThe images from the bardo don\u2019t have to follow a narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted something that would work in a dreamlike way.\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
