    "text": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday told Delhi High Court that the agency was opposed to providing Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh a copy of the money laundering case lodged against him.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for ED, however, sought time from the court to get back on whether Mr Singh can be denied a copy of the case after Justice Ashutosh Kumar questioned whether someone can be divested of their legal right to have the documents.\n\nThe Judge also said if the documents sought are not given to Mr Singh, the same can not be used against him during trial.\n\nThe court also asked about the reasons for ED\u2019s refusal to give the documents and said the agency will have to convince it about it.\n\nThe CBI, represented by Additional Solicitor General P S Patwalia, told the court that it will provide a xerox copy of the documents seized from Mr Singh\u2019s office and residence. He said that 40 per cent of the photocopying work is over.\n\nThe agency, however, told the High Court that it had kept the documents with it on the direction of the trial court and, if Mr Singh required a copy, he should have approached the trial court.\n\nThe High Court, thereafter, adjourned the matter to January 7, saying it will pass orders on that date on the plea of Mr Singh. The ED has filed a case against Mr Singh under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\n\nMr Singh, in his plea, has also sought a direction to CBI to provide him all the documents seized by the agency when it had raided his residence and office.\n\nOn September 26 this year, CBI had conducted raids at 11 places including Mr Singh\u2019s residences in Delhi and Himachal, on the day his daughter was getting married. -- PTI",
