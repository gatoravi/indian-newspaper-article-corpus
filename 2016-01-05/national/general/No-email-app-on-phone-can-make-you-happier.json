While it can be a valuable communication tool, it is clear that it is a source of stress of frustration for many of us,\u201d lead author Richard MacKinnon, insight director, Future Work Centre, was quoted as saying by Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cThe people who reported it being most useful to them also reported the highest levels of email pressure,\u201d MacKinnon noted.\n\nManagers experience significantly higher levels of stress when compared to non-managers, the results of the survey showed.\n\n\u201cThe habits we develop, the emotional reactions we have to messages and the unwritten organisational etiquette around e-mail, combine into a toxic source of stress which could be negatively impacting our productivity and wellbeing,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u2014 IANS\n\nE-mail is a great communication tool but also a source of stress, says new research",
