At this juncture, this attack might have been launched intentionally to disrupt this momentum [in Indo-Pak ties]. Many media reports have expressed such doubts...,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a media briefing in response to a question.\n\nMs. Hua said there were \u201csigns of improvement\u201d in New Delhi-Islamabad ties, which was welcomed by all sides. In an apparent reference to the Lahore meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, Ms. Hua noted, citing media reports \u201cthat the meeting between Indian and Pakistan leaders was very successful.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson stressed that an uninterrupted dialogue between India and Pakistan was a key factor in promoting regional peace and stability.",
