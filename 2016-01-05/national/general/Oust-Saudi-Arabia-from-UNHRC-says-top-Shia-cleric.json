    "text": "Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad has termed a \u201cjoke\u201d the Saudi Arabian leadership of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) after prominent Shia and Sunni clerics were executed in that country last week.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Hindu , Maulana Jawad, considered the most influential Shia cleric in India (Shias, according to figures from 2005-06, comprise 25-31% of the Muslim population in India), said international pressure had to be brought to remove Saudi Arabia from even being a member of the UNHRC.\n\n\u201cThere is no democracy in Saudi Arabia and there is an institutionalised crushing of dissent. Not only was [Shia cleric] Nimr al-Nimr executed, so was Sunni cleric Fahris al Zahrani for expressing dissent, and the latter has been branded as the al-Qaeda, which is doubtful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has a history of crushing dissent brutally and their headship of the UNHRC is a joke. The international community should apply sanctions against Saudi Arabia and remove them from the UNHRC,\u201d he said. The executions have set off a diplomatic war between Saudi Arabia and Iran and have resulted in the severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nMaulana Jawad, however, does not have any hope of the Indian government lobbying for the issue. \u201cThe Indian government is handicapped because of its oil needs. They will never take a strong stance against Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\nVital role\n\nShias in Lucknow play an important role in electing the MP from the seat, earlier represented by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and now by Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Mr. Vajpayee and the BJP have enjoyed good terms with the community in the past.",
