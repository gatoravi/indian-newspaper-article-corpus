    "text": "Samajwadi Party on Monday claimed to have bagged 36 district Panchayat chairman posts unopposed, including one in Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency Amethi.\n\n\u201cOf the 74 districts, where elections for the post of district Panchayat Chairman are going on, the party has won unopposed in 36 districts, including Amethi. It\u2019s a big success of the party,\u201d SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury said.\n\nMonday was the last day of withdrawal of nominations.\n\nElections are scheduled on January 7 following which the State Election Commission will declare the formal results.\n\nSP candidates won unopposed in Amethi, Lalitpur and Sant Kabir Nagar after withdrawals.\n\nIn an embarrassment to the Congress, the party\u2019s Amethi nominee for the post of Chairman of district Panchayat, Krishna Chaurasiya, withdrew her nomination paving way for the unopposed election of SP candidate.\n\nShiv Kali Maurya is the lone nominee left for the post of Zila Panchayat Chairman in Amethi after the withdrawal of nomination of Congress candidate Krishna Chaurasiya, District Magistrate of Amethi Jagatraj Tewari said.\n\nThere was a direct contest between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party for the post in Mr Gandhi\u2019s constituency. Yogendra Misra, local unit president of the Congress, said that the party has nothing to do with the withdrawal of Ms Chaurasiya\u2019s candidature and it was her personal decision.\n\n\u201cHad she contested, the party would have extended full support,\u201d Mr Misra said.\n\n\u201cShe has not taken party\u2019s advice on withdrawing her candidature and it is her personal decision,\u201d said Mr Gandhi\u2019s representative Chandrakant Dubey who was present during the filing of nomination by Ms Chaurasiya. -- PTI",
