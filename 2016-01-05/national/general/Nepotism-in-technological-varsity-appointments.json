    "text": "Communist Party of India (Marxist) legislator G. Sudhakaran has accused the State government of doing little to make the proposed Abdul Kalam Technological University a reality.\n\nHe said the government\u2019s actions in the matter had largely remained on paper. The university, to which over 150 engineering colleges would be affiliated in the near future, had no office. However, it had a vice chancellor, a pro vice chancellor, an examination controller and a few important officials.\n\nA private company had been entrusted with the administrative matters of the university. Students and parents had no direct access to university officials.\n\nThese decisions had opened the way for big ticket corruption and nepotism in appointments, he said.",
