It is considered an invasive species because of its capacity to dominate space and crowd out other marine organisms.\n\nResearcher Robert Panipilla, who coordinated the project, said the colonies of the soft coral were documented at 10 metre depth off Kovalam and 18 metre depth off Enayam.\n\n\u201cLast month, we deployed scuba divers after receiving information from local fishermen that the species had colonised parts of the reef,\u201d he said. A native of the tropical Western Atlantic and the Caribbean, C.riisei was first reported as an invasive species from Hawaii in 1972. Since then, it has spread to Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nIn India, it has been reported from the Gulf of Mannar, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gulf of Kutch and Goa.\n\nWith its capacity to thickly settle and occupy a variety of surfaces, C.riisei can destabilise the marine ecosystem, says K. Padmakumar, Pro Vice Chancellor, Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS).\n\nHe fears it will crowd out other species like corals, sponges, algae, ascidians that contribute to the rich marine biodiversity of the region.",
