    "text": "The United Jehad Council (UJC), a conglomerate of 13 militant groups in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on Monday claimed responsibility for the Pathankot airbase attack.\n\nCNS, a Srinagar-based wire service, quoted UJC spokesman Syed Sadaqat Hussain to say that Kashmiri militants associated with the \u2018Highway Squad\u2019 attacked the airbase.\n\n\u201cThe Indian government and its media have been suffering from Pakistan phobia. By blaming Pakistan for every attack, India neither succeeded in the past to malign the Kashmir freedom struggle nor will it get anything in future through a malicious propaganda,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe attack on the Pathankot airbase by the Kashmiri Mujhadeen carries a message to India that no security establishment is out of reach of the militants,\u201d he said.",
