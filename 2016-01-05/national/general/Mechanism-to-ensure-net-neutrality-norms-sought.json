    "text": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a consultation paper on differential pricing for data services for which the last date for submitting comments is January 7. The consultation paper raises issues related to zero-rating tariff models \u2013 a practice wherein service providers offer free data to users for select applications and websites.\n\nNasscom president R. Chandrashekhar said the regulator should have the power to allow differential pricing for certain types/classes of services that are deemed to be in public interest and based on mandatory prior approvals.\n\n\u2018Consultation must\u2019\n\n\u201cAny differential pricing programs including proposals by TSPs and their partners should have explicit directives/approval of the regulator and deemed to be in public interest\u2026 Such proposals should be subject to a wider public consultation by the regulator before arriving at a final decision,\u201d the industry body said. In addition, Nasscom has also proposed that a suitable oversight mechanism should be put in a place to check that the TSPs continue to abide by the principles of net neutrality.\n\nIt has recommended establishing an independent not-for-profit entity with an independent board, which would own and manage proposed differential pricing programs.\n\n\u201cDifferential pricing should not become a tool that facilitates market dominance or enables anti-competitive behaviour by either TSP or platform provider. It should not offer direct or indirect commercial benefit including leveraging the value of customer data generated in the process. Further it should not offer lower prices for own or partner content/ service,\u201d Nasscom Internet Council Chairman Sanjiv Bikhchandani said.",
