Gross said India will be making a \u201cbig mistake\u201d if it discourages its people from going abroad in search of greener pastures.\n\nResponding to queries at an interaction programme with journalists here on Monday, Prof. Gross said the only option before India was to either \u201cclose the door\u201d to emigration or create opportunities locally for people to pursue their chosen area of research.\n\nThough Indians abroad had very strong emotional ties with their native country, they are unable to return due to absence of opportunities.",
