However, agriculture experts say there is nothing to worry at this stage but a dip in temperature and rain in next few days would be helpful for the crop as it is in the vegetative stage.\n\n\u201cWheat crop is in a critical stage. It\u2019s been a long dry spell coupled with unusual warm winters. If there are no rains in the next 7 to 10 days, wheat yield will suffer adversely,\u201d senior agriculture expert and Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser P.S Rangi told The Hindu , pointing out that the quality of grain would also deteriorate in the absence of timely rain.\n\nHe said rain in the next few days followed by sunshine would assist in proper photosynthesis process, otherwise the quality of wheat could stay poor.\n\n\u201cThere have been negligible rains since September in the wheat growing States and hence, there is more moisture stress in central India, mainly in Madhya Pradesh, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,\u201d said J.S. Sandhu, Deputy Director-General (Crop Science), at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), adding that rain in next few days were crucial for the crop.",
