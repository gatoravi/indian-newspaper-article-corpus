Harpal Singh\n\nAnyone wanting to witness the intrinsic relationship between education and food security in low income and poverty ridden areas should visit the backward Sirpur Assembly constituency in the Adilabad district of Telangana.\n\nProvision of mid-day meals at government junior colleges here for the last 20 days has resulted in improved attendance of students thereby enhancing the scope for them to perform better in exams.\n\n\u201cYou do not need to be an expert to know that food security is valuable to poor students to record good educational performance,\u201d observed Sirpur MLA Koneru Konappa, who is the force behind the \u2018private\u2019 effort at providing mid-day meals at plus-2 level.\n\n\u201cNo student has missed classes in the afternoon session during the fortnight as we have been providing food at their colleges,\u201d he added.\n\nThe result of an experiment in providing free meals to students of Government Junior College, Kagaznagar, had actually enthused the MLA to extend the scheme to other colleges in his constituency this year. \u201cWe provided mid-day meals for 40 days and the Kagaznagar College recorded 90 per cent passes and one of its students scored 93 per cent in Intermediate II year exam to stand first in the district,\u201d Mr. Konappa recalled. The students are getting a decent meal consisting of quality rice, one curry, dal and a banana.",
