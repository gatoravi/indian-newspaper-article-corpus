The Bhaag Milkha Bhaag already writes newspaper columns.\n\n\u201cI am writing a novel. It\u2019s fiction but, yes, people tend to add their own experience. It should come out midyear. It\u2019s going to be drama,\u201d said Divya, who is currently shooting for Irada . As much as she enjoys writing, she says that she knew that acting was her true calling. \u201cI was the head girl of my school (Sacred Heart Convent in Ludhiana). There was a time when I was asked \u2018What do you want to become?\u2019 I said \u2018I want to be an actor.\u2019 There was pin drop silence in the class. I was taken to the principal and was told not to cook up stories like that.\n\n\u201cYears later, they all came to visit me in Mumbai and, yes, they are proud of me,\u201d she said. \u2014 IANS",
