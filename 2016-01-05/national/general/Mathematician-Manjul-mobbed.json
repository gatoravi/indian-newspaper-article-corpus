    "text": "Princeton mathematician Manjul Bhargava got a little more publicity than he bargained for. At a special lecture in the Science Congress, Mr.Bhargava\u2019s hour-long talk on the genius and contribution of Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan so charged the audience of students that several of them mobbed him for an autograph.\n\nThe mathematician had to be spirited away by the organisers to a separate room, where he stayed put for a good 20 minutes. He finally got away\u2014 amidst teeming students \u2014 only after the organisers promised a special interaction on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Children\u2019s Science Congress, a sister function being organised alongside the Indian Science Congress.\n\n\u201cHe was upset,\u201d said N Ramachandra, among the organisers of the congress. \u201cHe was ready to meet students in groups of 5-10 but tomorrow [Tuesday], he will be available at the Children\u2019s Congress.\u201d However, when Mr. Bhargava made it to his car, he didn\u2019t appear to be grim and even signed autographs for a few students.\n\nMr.Bhargava\u2019s evening lecture delved into the greatness of Ramanujan\u2019s contribution to mathematics and he signed off his talk with a movie trailer on the forthcoming movie, The Man Who Knew Infinity , starring Dev Patel and directed by Mathew Brown. Mr.Bhargava is an associate producer of the movie and said he was there to ensure that the \u201cmathematics and historical treatment were accurate\u201d. \u201cThe movie has been shown at some film festivals, including at Goa, but awaits a wider commercial release. Mr. Bhargava, 41, is the winner of mathematics\u2019 most prestigious prize the Fields Medal.\n\nMr.Bhargava, who said he was on a mission to make Ramanujan\u2019s work better known, said some of the mathematician\u2019s works inspired his own doctoral dissertation.",
