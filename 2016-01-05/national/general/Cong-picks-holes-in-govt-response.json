    "text": "The Congress on Monday picked holes in the BJP-led NDA government\u2019s response to the Pathankot terror attack, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of weakening \u201cthe institutional mechanism\u201d that could have proved handy to tackle the security threat emanating from Pakistan.\n\nThough Congress president Sonia Gandhi\u2019s reaction to the terror strike was a measured one, the party spokesperson, Ajay Maken, came out all guns blazing against the Modi government.\n\nIn view of the 48-hour long gun battle between the Indian armed forces and the terrorists, Ms. Gandhi expressed her concern \u201cfor the safety of families as also strategic assets of Air Force,\u201d and hoped that the government \u201cis taking all necessary steps to neutralize the terror threats besides ensuring adequate security of citizens and strategic assets.\u201d\n\nTaking a tougher line, Mr. Maken said Prime Minister Modi is yet to respond on why the intelligence reports were ignored and the intrusion wasn\u2019t neutralised ahead of time.\n\n\u201cDespite specific input having been provided by none less than the abducted SP of Punjab Police, how did terrorists managed to enter our frontline air-force base and wreak havoc?\u201d asked Mr.Maken.\n\nMr. Maken criticised Mr. Modi for \u201cpropagating yoga\u201d in Karnataka at the time Indian armed forces were fighting with the terrorists. \u201cThe Cabinet Committee on Security did not meet even once to take stock of the situation over the last three days,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Maken also said the contradiction seen in the statements of various union ministers suggests that there is \u201ccomplete disharmony\u201d between the political leadership of the country.",
