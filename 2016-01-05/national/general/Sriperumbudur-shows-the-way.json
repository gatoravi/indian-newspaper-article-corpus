For every 150 homes, one pushcart has been provided, to remove segregated wastes to landfill.\n\nM.J. Sampath, executive officer of the local body, said the 6,470 households in 15 wards generated 12 metric tonnes of waste. A solid waste management initiative with respect to door-to-door garbage collection was launched in the town a year ago. The waste generated by the floating population was a major concern to them.\n\nHand in Hand provides comprehensive solid waste management services such as garbage collection, sorting, transportation and disposal.",
