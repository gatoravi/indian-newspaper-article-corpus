Mr. Kumar was addressing a function organised on the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Shilbhadra Yaji. The former Chief Minister of Haryana Bhupendra Singh Hooda was present on the dais. The man identified as Pravesh Kumar Rai was later arrested, said Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj.\n\nMr. Nitish Kumar had just begun his address and was reiterating his commitment to the implementation of a total ban on liquor when the man hurled the shoe. The security personnel immediately took him into custody, but Mr. Kumar was heard saying \u201c tum sharab pita hai kya ? [do you drink liquor?]\u2026 chhod do [leave him].\u201d He was, later, taken to the Bakhtiyarpur police station for further interrogation.",
