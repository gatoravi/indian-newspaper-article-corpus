    "text": "From March 1, train travel in unreserved class up to 200 km might become cumbersome as the Indian Railways has decided to withdraw two flexible options to buy unreserved tickets and travel at convenience.\n\nAs of now, a passenger travelling in an unreserved class within 200 km is allowed to buy tickets at any point of the day and board the train of his or her choice.\n\nAlso, the passenger need not buy the ticket at the originating station itself. The railways has now withdrawn both the facilities.\n\nFor distance up to 199 km, the journey should begin from the originating station within three hours of issue of ticket.\n\nFor distances above 200 km, there is no change in the existing provision and advance booking of three days will continue.\n\nThe circular said tickets for distance up to 199 km would be issued only at the originating station and the facility of return journey ticket has been withdrawn.",
