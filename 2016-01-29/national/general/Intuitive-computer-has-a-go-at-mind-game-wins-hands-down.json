The possible positions are almost infinite.\n\nSuch a search base is \u201ctoo enormous and too vast for brute force approaches to have any chance,\u201d added his colleague David Silver, who co-authored the paper in the science journal Nature .\n\nSo the team sought to create an AI system with a \u201cmore human-like\u201d approach to a game Hassabis said \u201cis played primarily through intuition and feel\u201d.\n\nAlphaGo uses two sets of \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d containing millions of neuron-like connections to reduce the search base to something more manageable. The first, \u201cpolicy network\u201d, narrows the search at each turn to only those moves most likely to lead to a win.\n\nThe second, \u201cvalue network\u201d, estimates a winner from each move made, \u201crather than searching all the way to the end of the game\u201d, said Mr. Silver.\n\n\u201cAlphaGo looks ahead by playing out the remainder of the game in its imagination many times over,\u201d he explained. \u2014 AFP",
