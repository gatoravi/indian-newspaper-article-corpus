The meeting was described as a \u201ccourtesy call\u201d by Raj Bhavan sources.\n\n\u2018CBI misused\u2019\n\nReacting to the development, Mr. Chavan, who heads the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee, said it was another example of \u201cvendetta politics\u201d by the BJP government against Congress leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the vendetta politics of the BJP governments at the Centre and State towards the Congress party and Congress leaders.
