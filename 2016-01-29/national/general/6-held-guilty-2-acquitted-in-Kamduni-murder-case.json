The incident sparked outrage across West Bengal.\n\nSaiful Ali, Ansar Ali and Aminul Ali were convicted of murder (IPC 302) gang rape (IPC 376 D), of causing injury during rape leading to death (IPC 376 A), criminal conspiracy (IPC 120 B) and causing disappearance of evidence of offence (IPC 201). Saiful Ali has also been convicted under Sections 109 (punishment for abatement if the act is committed in consequence) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC.\n\nImanul Islam, Bhola Naskar and Aminul Islam were also convicted under Section 376 D, 120 B, and 201 of the IPC. Two other accused, Rafikul Islam Gaji and Nur Ali, were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence.\n\n\u201cThe hearing on the quantum of punishment in the case will start from Friday,\u201d Firoz Edulji, one of the defence lawyers told The Hindu .\n\nThe family members of the victim, however, expressed displeasure over the verdict. They demanded capital punishment for all the accused.\n\nHailing the verdict, senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and Food Minister Jyotipriyo Mullick said the conviction itself proves that the police and administration worked impartially. Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Md. Salim said the fact that two of the accused were acquitted due to lack of evidence shows the failure of the police.",
