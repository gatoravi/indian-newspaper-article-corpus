Perhaps the proposal to nationalise Union Carbide India had already been discussed,\u201d Mr. Mukherjee writes.\n\nArguing that the move would send a wrong message, Mr. Mukherjee said: \u201cUnion Carbide is a big multinational. Nationalising it would be compared with the nationalisation of Coca-Cola and seen as a mistake \u2026 (it) will discourage future investments into India. This will be a huge setback.\u201d",
