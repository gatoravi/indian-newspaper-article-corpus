At the time, the government said they would be rescheduled in the \u201cvery near future.\u201d On Thursday, Pakistan\u2019s High Commissioner Abdul Basit told a TV channel that he hoped the talks would take place \u201csooner rather than later,\u201d and indicated they could be held in the first half of 2015.\n\nSpeaking to another TV channel, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s Foreign Affairs Adviser Sartaj Aziz said the \u201cball was in India\u2019s court,\u201d as Pakistan had suggested dates for the talks in early February. However, MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said while there was \u201calways a possibility\u201d of the talks taking place next month, \u201cNo mutually convenient dates have been found for the talks yet.\u201d\n\nThe delay in holding talks is giving credence to speculation that India still awaits more action by Pakistan against those responsible for the Pathankot attack in which 7 Indian soldiers were killed by terrorists believed to belong to the Jaish-e-Mohammad group and masterminded by JeM founder Masood Azhar.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Mr. Swarup said India and Pakistan were in \u201ccontinuous communication\u201d over the probe on Pathankot. Mr. Basit also said, \u201cIf the Pakistan team gets proper evidence, then I am confident that Masood Azhar will not meet the same fate as [LeT operations chief Zaki-ur-Rahman] Lakhvi,\u201d who got bail in the 26/11 trial last year. \u201cNo individual or organisation will be spared. I can assure you that,\u201d he told CNN-IBN.\n\nMr. Basit\u2019s remarks came a day after a Pakistani court rejected the government\u2019s plea for voice samples of the 26/11 accused to try and match them with Indian intercepts. In a sharp response to the court decision, Mr. Swarup, who contended that India was yet to be notified of the decision officially, said the Mumbai attack trial was \u201ca test of Pakistan\u2019s sincerity in combating terrorism directed against India.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe planning, training and financing of the Mumbai terrorist attack was done in Pakistan where 99 per cent of the evidence is. It is Pakistan\u2019s responsibility to unearth and present the requisite evidence in the ongoing trial so that the perpetrators are brought to justice,\u201d the MEA spokesperson said.",
