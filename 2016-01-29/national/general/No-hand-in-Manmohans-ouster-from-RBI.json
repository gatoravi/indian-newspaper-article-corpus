    "text": "President Pranab Mukherjee has rejected all conjectures about playing a role in former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s ouster as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor in 1985, after the two had a difference of opinion over U.K.-based NRI Swraj Paul\u2019s investments in India that triggered a three-year takeover battle for top firms such as DCM and Escorts.\n\nIn his book The Turbulent Years , Mr. Mukherjee indicates that the decision to move Dr. Singh to Planning Commission from the central bank was taken by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whose Principal Secretary P.C. Alexander conveyed the decision to Dr. Singh.\n\n\u201cI had absolutely no role in Dr. Manmohan Singh\u2019s departure from the RBI,\u201d he writes.\n\nDr. Singh\u2019s daughter Daman Singh in her book Strictly Personal: Manmohan and Gursharan quotes him as saying he had serious disagreements with Mr. Mukherjee when he was the RBI Governor.\n\n\u201cI never saw any differences with Dr. Singh. On the rare occasions they occurred, as anything other than legitimate exchanges of opinion over professional matters,\u201d Mr. Mukherjee wrote.",
