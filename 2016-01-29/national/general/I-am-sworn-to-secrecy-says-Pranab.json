    "text": "President Pranab Mukherjee said at the launch of the second volume of his memoirs that his desire to keep certain things confidential was related to his oath as a Minister of the Union.\n\n\u201cI have a conservative approach to this,\u201d he said. \u201cI write at least a page in my diary every day, and its custodian is my daughter [Sharmishta Mukherjee]. I have told her that you may digitise the contents if you want, but you will not release them. People may come to know of events when the government of the day releases files related to that period, not by someone\u2019s recollection of it. Some facts are to be buried with me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe book but has some fairly explosive details of India\u2019s recent history, including the three deaths at the top of India\u2019s political pyramid that President Mukherjee witnessed \u2014 that of Sanjay Gandhi, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nIndian Council for Cultural Relations chief Karan Singh, who also spoke on the book, said Mr. Mukherjee had made rather \u201cshrewd assessments of personalities like Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi or P.V. Narasimha Rao\u201d, but the messages he gives in the course of the book are also important.",
