Gen. Ashok Kumar from the Army Service Corps (ASC) and Maj. Gen. S.S. Lamba from the Army Ordinance Corps (AOC).\n\nThe Ministry sources on Thursday confirmed the development and said Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had asked the CBI to look into the matter.\n\nThe CBI sources said that they had just received the communication but are yet to go through the files.\n\nAllegations of bribe had surfaced in promotions to the rank of Lieutenant General after the Army Promotion Board submitted its recommendations to the Ministry.\n\nIncidentally both the officers were awarded Ati Vishisht Seva Medal in 2015 for distinguished service.",
