Pant then appointed another former High Court judge, Sanjay Misra, as the State\u2019s anti-corruption ombudsman.\n\nThe decision follows a prolonged litigation that saw the Bench, fed up with the \u201clack of consensus\u201d among the State\u2019s constitutional authorities \u2014 the Chief Minister, the Opposition leader and the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court \u2014 went ahead with a rare display of its extraordinary powers vested under Article 142 of the Constitution to appoint Justice Singh as Lokayukta from a list of five names presented to it by the State government on December 16.\n\nHowever, the appointment triggered a row when news reports surfaced that the State government had included Justice Singh\u2019s name in the list of five shown to the apex court despite objections raised by High Court Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud about Justice Singh\u2019s integrity.\n\nSubsequently, the controversy returned to the Bench after the State agreed to freeze Justice Singh\u2019s swearing-in until the apex court cleared it.\n\nIn his short judgment for the Bench, Justice Gogoi said Chief Justice Chandrachud\u2019s reservations have to be given primacy over that of the Chief Minister and the Opposition Leader in the consultative process for the selection of Lokayukta.\n\n\u2018Order inaccurate\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are persuaded to hold that our order appointing Justice Virendra Singh (retd.) as Lokayukta was on the basis of the statement made on behalf of the State of Uttar Pradesh which now appears to be somewhat inaccurate,\u201d the judgment said.\n\nFormer HC judge, Sanjay Misra, is\n\nnow the State\u2019s\n\nanti-corruption ombudsman",
