The BMMA has also filed a petition at the Bombay High Court which is to be heard on February 3.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting to see what happens at the court. But we are going to intensify our agitation and mobilise women against patriarchal mindsets. There is nothing in Islam that prohibits women\u2019s entry into the dargah.\n\nThese impositions are by patriarchal men who take control of religious places. But this country runs on the Constitution. This is a fight for equal rights. The reason given by the trustees for banning women are baseless. Religion should become scientific,\u201d Jyoti Badekar of VMS told The Hindu .\n\nMs. Badekar said women will stage a protest march to Haji Ali on the lines of the one held at Shani Shingnapur on or before March 8.",
