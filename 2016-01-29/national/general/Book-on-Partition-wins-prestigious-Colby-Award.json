Colby Award for 2016, a statement said.\n\nHajari\u2019s first book covers the Partition and the violence that surrounded that event.\n\nThe prize, named after a former CIA Director, is awarded annually by Norwich University to a first-time author in recognition of a work of fiction or non-fiction that has made a major contribution to the understanding of military history, intelligence operation, or international affairs.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely thrilled to be named the recipient of the 2016 Colby Award,\u201d Hajari, a journalist, said. \u201cTo join the company of such distinguished military and historical writers as Jon Meacham and Dexter Filkins is a tremendous honour, and it\u2019s particularly gratifying that the judges chose to highlight a subject that may be unfamiliar to many American readers.\u201d\n\nThe award and honorarium will be presented to Hajari at Norwich University in April. \u2014 PTI",
