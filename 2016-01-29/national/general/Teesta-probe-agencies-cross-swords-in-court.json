Dave that investigating authorities had begun to make \u201cunreasonable\u201d demands for cash vouchers of purchases dating back to 2004.\n\nSolicitor-General Ranjit Kumar countered that the couple was not handing over documents relevant to the probe like utilisation certificates showing how they spent money they received from overseas organisations.\n\n\u201cWhat we are asking for, they are not giving. We have 4,723 documents, but none of them relates to the documents asked for,\u201d Mr. Kumar submitted.\n\n\u201cIf they got money through a grant, they have to spend the money as required by the grant ... they would have given documents showing this to the grantor ... We are seeking these documents and not the expenses on liquor and wine,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.\n\n\u201cFor two months, we have been asking them to take the documents from us. They say, come later today, come tomorrow ...\u201d Mr. Sibal said alleging non-co-operation by the probe agencies.\n\n\u201cWe will pass an appropriate order giving time for supply of documents and if the order is not complied with, we can even vacate our order [granting anticipatory bail],\u201d Justice Dave observed.\n\nThe court then extended the couple\u2019s bail to March 18, while directing their lawyers to provide detailed response to a list of documents sought for by the probe agencies since April 11, 2015. The court said the couple should clearly answer whether they had given or were unable to hand over each document listed. Next hearing is scheduled for March 9.",
