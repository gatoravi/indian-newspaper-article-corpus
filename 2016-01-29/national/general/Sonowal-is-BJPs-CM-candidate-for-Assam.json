I am grateful to them,\u201d Mr. Sonowal said.\n\nAssam is crucial for the BJP, as it is the only State where the party seems to be in the fight this year.\n\nMr. Sonowal was the party\u2019s Assam State chief during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when it performed very well at the time of what was seen as a Modi wave in large parts of India.",
