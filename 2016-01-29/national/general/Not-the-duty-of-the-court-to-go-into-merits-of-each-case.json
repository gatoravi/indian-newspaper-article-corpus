    "text": "The Vigilance Court, which directed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) under the Kerala police to immediately file a First Information Report (FIR) against Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Electricity Minister Aryadan Mohammed in the solar scam, on Thursday observed that extraordinary circumstances necessitated extraordinary measures.\n\nOn a petition filed by social activist P.D. Joseph, Judge S.S. Vasan ordered that the Chief Minister and the Electricity Minister be investigated.\n\nThe judge also recalled an old Malayalam saying Uppu thinnavan vellam kudikkum (he who eats salt will ultimately drink water) and elaborated on the dictum of equal justice for all, and that the law considered each and every one equal.\n\nReferring to the merit of the allegations against the Chief Minister, the judge said it was not the duty of the court to look into the merit of each case coming up for its consideration. Only the investigating officials could confirm the merit or otherwise of allegations after conducting a proper verification.\n\nWhen the VACB legal adviser said the case would not come within the purview of the Vigilance Court in Thrissur as the alleged incident may have happened in Thiruvananthapuram, the judge approved the counter-argument of the petitioner that the impact of the scam extended even up to Kochi, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Thrissur court.",
