    "text": "One of the men who was believed to be absconding and in Japan en route to join the ISIS a few days ago, was picked up from his house at Mallepally here on Thursday night.\n\nThe name of 33-year-old Mohammed Faizan had cropped up after National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials had taken into custody Nafeez Khan, Obedullah Khan, Mohammad Shariff Mohiuddin and Abu Anas from Hyderabad for allegedly trying to join the IS. Eight others were also picked up from across the country during raids.\n\nA few days ago, intelligence officials had told the media that Faizan and another person named Arfan were absconding, and had obtained visas for Japan. This proved to be untrue in Faizan\u2019s case, as his family members said he was very much in Hyderabad.\n\nHowever, his brother Mohammed Atif said that Faizan was not involved in any illegal activity. \u201cHe is ready to co-operate with any agency, as my brother is innocent,\u201d said Atif.\n\nAccording to Atif, Faizan had a nodding acquaintance with the four boys who were arrested by the NIA. \u201cHe has nothing to do with whatever they are said to be involved in,\u201d he said. Faizan works as a manager at a private company in Hyderabad.",
