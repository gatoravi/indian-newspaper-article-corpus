    "text": "Actor Salman Khan on Thursday moved a caveat petition in the Supreme Court, requesting to be heard when the criminal appeal filed by the Maharashtra government challenging a Bombay High Court judgment acquitting him in the 2002 hit-and-run case comes up for hearing.\n\nThe State government had on Friday last challenged the High Court\u2019s decision to acquit the actor in the case of September 28, 2002 when he allegedly drove his car over five persons, of which one was killed, sleeping on a platform in Mumbai.\n\n\u201cThe High Court completely ignored the \u2018conduct\u2019 of the accused who did not make any attempt to report the incident to the police soon after the accident,\u201d the appeal claimed. The State\u2019s appeal details how an allegedly drunk Mr. Khan \u201cran away from the spot\u201d while his bodyguard, Ravindra Patil, \u201cdid his duty\u201d as a policeman and registered a First Information Report on the incident at the Bandra Police Station.\n\nThe appeal, filed through Supreme Court advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar, alleged that Mr. Khan was under the influence of liquor and did not have a driving licence.\n\n\u201cThe High Court erred in brushing aside the alcohol examination certificate and the evidence of the assistant chemical analyser just because there was some alleged delay in taking the blood samples and sending it to the chemical analyser,\u201d the State government contended.",
