    "text": "The second volume of President Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s memoirs The Turbulent Years (1980-1996) was released on Thursday even as the author himself said that \u201csome facts are to be buried with me\u201d at the event at Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nVice-President Hamid Ansari released the first copy of the book, with a fairly eclectic audience of Indian Council for Cultural Relations chief Karan Singh, former Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, former External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh and former Comptroller and Auditor-General (C&AG) of India Vinod Rai.\n\n\u2018Admits fiasco\u2019\n\nWhile admitting that there were many things that he had kept confidential in this volume of his memoirs, Mr. Mukherjee was candid enough about his political life away from government files, terming the launch of his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress, after he left the Congress over differences with the late Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, a \u201cfiasco.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a mass leader, like say, Ajoy Mukherjee was or as Mamata [Banerjee] is, and I have admitted that I should not have attempted this,\u201d he said.",
