The house owner informed us at 2 a.m. today [Thursday] that he had no option but to ask us to vacate the house and our office within a week,\u201d Ms. Khandelwal told The Hindu .\n\nWithin hours of the eviction notice to JagLag, freelance journalist Malini Subramaniam, who once headed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the State, was also asked to vacate her house within eight days by her house owner.\n\n\u201cIn the evening, members of the Samajik Ekta Manch [a vigilante group supported by the Bastar police] came to the JagLag office, shouting slogans, and created a ruckus,\u201d said Ms. Abhinav Gupta, an associate of JagLag.\n\nMs. Subramaniam has been consistently reporting on the atrocities on tribals and police excesses in Bastar. Last week, some members of the Samajik Ekta Manch attacked her house and damaged her car. The police have taken no action even after Ms. Subramaniam named two persons in her complaint.\n\n\u201cThe timing of these events does not escape our notice. This is coming at a time when the whole countryside of Bastar is on fire. Under the guise of anti-Naxal operations, security forces are indulging in rape, pillage and plunder. With teams of women activists, we have documented at least three cases of mass sexual violence in the past three months alone, in which security forces have run amok in villages, stripping women, playing with their naked bodies and indulging in gang rape, looting their precious food supplies and destroying their homes and granaries,\u201d said a statement issued by Ms. Khandelwal and Shalni Gera of JagLag.\n\nAsked about the eviction notice to JagLag members and Ms. Subramaniam, Superintendent of Police R.N. Das told The Hindu that he had \u201cno idea\u201d about it. Bastar police chief S.R.P. Kalluri did not respond to the calls from The Hindu . Collector Amit Kataria said he was unaware of the developments.\n\nLandlord reportedly forced to ask them to vacate their houses, office within eight days",
