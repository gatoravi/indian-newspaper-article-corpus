A Belgian Research Institute, Vito has developed a technology not only to clean sewage water but also to produce electricity out of it,\u201d Joren Vandeweyer, spokesperson for the Belgian Secretary of State for Foreign Trade, Pieter De Crem, said.\n\nAsked about the challenges, Mr. Vandeweyer said: \u201cFirst is cleaning up the actual pollution \u2014 there are certain companies that specialise in that. The second is preventing pollution; that is a huge effort, but that will come.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the current events in the country, including the student protests, would hamper foreign investments in India, Jan Luykx, Belgium Ambassador to India, said protests were a part of democracy.\n\nRecalling the number of protests that happen in the European Union and Brussels, Mr. Luykx said, \u201cAs part of democracy, this [protests] happens. That\u2019s not a drama. People protest, there is a little bit of chaos on the streets. This is healthy in a way.\u201d\n\nMr. Luykx and Mr. Vandeweyer said the government was making the right efforts with regard to the economy. \u201cThis government is showing a lot of political will to reform, to make it more business-friendly. There are certain measures to be taken, certain measures are already good,\u201d Mr. Luykx said.\n\nMr. Vandeweyer, however, added that the government had to have a business-friendly climate with good regulations and a good legal system.\n\nHe called for a predictable tax regime for investors. \u201c\u2026 not [on] Day 1, you ask so many taxes, day 2 you increase \u2026 it is important to have predictability because they [businesses] invest for 20-30 years. If you do that, businesses will come. India is a huge emerging market and the economy is growing,\u201d he said.\n\nBelgium also wants to diversify its trade with India in the diamond business, which contributes to a large part of the bilateral trade. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Belgium as part of his EU tour in March.\n\n'\u201cIt is work in progress. There will be nice outcomes from this visit,\u201d Mr. Luykx said.",
