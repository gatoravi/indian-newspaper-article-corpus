    "text": "NASA funded the project with $6.5 mn\n\nAn engineer from the University of Michigan has developed a prototype of a thruster that may form the basis for a propulsion system to take a manned spacecraft to Mars in the 2020s.\n\nNASA has funded a spaceflight propulsion system to be built around a tabletop-sized thruster developed by Alec Gallimore, the Richard F and Eleanor A Towner professor of engineering.\n\nThe US space agency awarded $6.5 million over the next three years to Aerojet Rocketdyne for the development of the propulsion system, dubbed the XR\u2014100.\n\nMr. Gallimore\u2019s thruster, called X3, is central to this system and his team will receive $1 million of the award for work on the the device.\n\nPlasma principle\n\nThe XR\u2014100 is up against two competing designs. All three of them rely on ejecting plasma \u2014 an energetic state of matter in which electrons and charged atoms called ions coexist \u2014 out of the back of the thruster.\n\nBut the X3 has a bit of a head start. For thrusters of its design power, 200 kilowatts, it is relatively small and light.\n\nThe core technology \u2014 the Hall thruster \u2014 is already in use for manoeuvring satellites in orbit around Earth.\n\n\u201cFor comparison, the most powerful Hall thruster in orbit right now is 4.5 kilowatts,\u201d Mr. Gallimore said.\n\nThat\u2019s sufficient to adjust the orbit or orientation of a satellite but it\u2019s too little power to move the massive amounts of cargo needed to support human exploration of deep space.\n\nScott Hall, a doctoral student in Mr. Gallimore\u2019s lab, will use the funding to put the X3 through a battery of tests, running it up to 60 kilowatts and then up to 200 kilowatts.\n\nDoctoral student Sarah Cusson will investigate a tweak that could allow the X3 to remain operational for five-to-10 times longer than its current lifetime of a little over a year. \u2014 IANS",
