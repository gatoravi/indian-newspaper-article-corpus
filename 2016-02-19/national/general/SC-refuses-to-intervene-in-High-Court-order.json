    "text": "The Supreme Court said on Thursday that there was no reason to intervene in the Gauhati High Court\u2019s interim order on January 7, 2016, staying the disqualification of 14 rebel Congress MLAs by the former Arunachal Pradesh Speaker, Nabam Rebia, for defection under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nIt was against this stay that Mr. Rebia and Congress leaders had moved the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, a Constitution Bench, led by Justice J.S. Khehar, asked the High Court to expeditiously dispose of the writ petitions pending before it on the disqualification, preferably in two weeks.\n\nIt cautioned that any action, including the formation of a new government on the strength of the support from the 14 rebel MLAs, would depend on the final decision of the High Court.\n\nDecks cleared\n\nDissident Congress leader Kalikho Pul, one of the disqualified MLAs, can now stake a claim to form a government with what he claims to be 32 MLAs in the 58-strong House.",
