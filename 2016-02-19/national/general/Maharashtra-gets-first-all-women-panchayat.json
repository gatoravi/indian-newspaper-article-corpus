    "text": "For 26-year-old Sonali Shahpure, juggling household work with politics does not come naturally. She comes from a family of political non-starters. The political novice borrowed Rs. 50,000 from the local bank to pool money into the village development fund set up by the 11 elected members of the Bubnal gram panchayat in Shirol Taluka, southern Maharashtra. All members who chipped in with their share had one thing in common \u2014 they were all women with no political background.\n\n\u201cIn the morning, I take care of my family and children and step out later in the day to take care of the roads and drains in my village. Both are my priority now,\u201d said Ms. Shahpure.\n\nThe village has taken a lead in women\u2019s political participation by becoming first in the State to adopt 100% political representation for women at the gram panchayat level. Elders of the village, who had decided six months ago to elect these women unopposed to the panchayat feel the group has brought in more transparency and accountability.\n\nThe members have pooled Rs. 5.5 lakh as development fund and are now petitioning the State government to sanction an additional special fund of Rs. 25,00,000 lakh for future development works.\n\n\u201cWe were fed up of the caste politics and the destruction seasoned politicians caused at the cost of development. So we decided to give all posts, including that of the sarpanch, to women. Each member will become sarpanch on a rotation basis,\u201d said Ulfatbai Afsar.\n\nShe said her nine-member council had just begun work on improving health and sanitation and water supply of the village.",
