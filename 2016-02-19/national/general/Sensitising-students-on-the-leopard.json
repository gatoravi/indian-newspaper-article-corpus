    "text": "The first workshop for children, following the recent dramatic entry of a leopard into a school in Marathahalli in Bengaluru, was conducted on Thursday to dispel myths that instil fear about the big cat.\n\nAround 200 participants from 129 schools gathered at New Baldwin International School at Mandur, where the education department, forest officials and activists, and the police deliberated on the best practices for a school to follow as well as what to do if a leopard is sighted.\n\n\u201cWe gave them instructions and tips on how to reduce the chances of animals wandering into the school compound. The most basic thing that needs to be done is the installation of a grill or a compound wall,\u201d said Block Education Officer, S.M. Ramesh.",
