    "text": "To revive itself in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2017 elections, the Congress is aggressively eyeing Dalits.\n\nOn Thursday, the party released a 22-point manifesto promising better representation for Dalits in the party and a slew of measures and laws that it would bring for their benefit if it came to power. Dalits form 21 per cent of the State electorate.\n\nCongress vice-president Rahul Gandhi launched a direct attack on Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, accusing her of crushing Dalit leadership in U.P. Trying to isolate Ms. Mayawati, the Congress vice-president praised her mentor and BSP founder Kanshiram but insisted she had \u201cwasted\u201d the platform built by him for Dalits. Addressing party leaders, workers and Dalit office-bearers at a \u2018Dalit Conclave\u2019 here, Mr. Gandhi argued that had Ms. Mayawati \u201cnot been fearful of the Dalit youth and leadership, and used their strength,\u201d the community would have achieved far more than it has.\n\n\u2018Big opportunity\u2019\n\nThe BSP\u2019s neglect of Dalit leadership is \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the Congress to grab Dalit votes, Mr. Gandhi said, even as he expressed confidence that the party would form the government in 2017.\n\nMr. Gandhi promised that the Congress would create a \u201cyuva dalit leadership\u201d.\n\nWooing Dalits, the Congress recently concluded its second phase of Bhim Jyoti Yatras aimed at correcting its image among Dalits and \u201cclearing misgivings\u201d about Ambedkar\u2019s relation with the party.",
