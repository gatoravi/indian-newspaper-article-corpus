We understand that there is a problem\u2026 I am talking of the PMR which is required for the forces,\u201d Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said on Thursday in an interview to India Today TV on the programme, \u201cTo the point\u201d.\n\nThe PMR in the armed forces is a way of maintaining a younger officer profile at the middle level and open up vacancies for lower ranks. Currently the PMR tenure for Jawans and Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) is 15 years and for officers it is 20 years after which they are eligible for pension.\n\nHowever, he said that there has to be a distinction between those leaving service for greener pastures and those leaving for the sake of the country.\n\nDefending the equalisation of pension every five years as it was mentioned by the Koshyari committee, Mr. Parrikar said it would be looked into by the one-man judicial committee. \u201cWe have no objection in referring anything and everything to the committee\u2026\u201d he added in response to questions from journalist Karan Thapar.\n\nThe government issued the notification implementing the OROP in November last year which stated that personnel opting for the PMR will be out of the ambit of the OROP effectively distinguishing those who had already retired and those opting for the PMR in future.\n\n\u201cPersonnel who opt to get discharged henceforth on their own request\u2026. will not be entitled to the benefits of the OROP. It will be effective prospectively,\u201d the notification said.\n\nThis statement goes against the recommendations of the A.V. Singh committee of 2004 which recommended ways of lowering the age of Commanding officers and brigade commanders for combat and support arms.",
