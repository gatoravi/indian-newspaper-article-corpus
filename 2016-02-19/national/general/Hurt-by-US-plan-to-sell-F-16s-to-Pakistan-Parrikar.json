    "text": "India to keep pressure over fighter jet deal ahead of U.S.-Pakistan Feb. 29 talks\n\nWe have conveyed our opinion quite clearly to the U.S, says Manohar Parrikar.\n\nExpressing \u201churt\u201d over the U.S.\u2019 decision to sell Pakistan eight F-16 fighter jets, the government said it had made it clear that the deal was unacceptable to India.\n\n\u201cI am quite hurt by [the sale of F-16s to Pakistan] and we have expressed our opinion quite clearly to the U.S.,\u201d Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar told India Today TV\u2019s \u2018To The Point\u2019 programme in an interview on Thursday.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s statement comes nearly a week after the Ministry of External Affairs had summoned U.S. Ambassador Richard Verma to express India\u2019s \u201cdisappointment\u201d and displeasure over the announcement of the deal worth approximately $699 million.\n\nWhile the U.S. government had formally notified its Congress of its intention to make the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) last Friday, the deal may take some months, especially after objections from Congressmen of any plans by the U.S. of subsidising the deal.\n\nSources said India had made it clear that not only was its opposition to the deal over the fact that the military hardware would be used to bolster Pakistani defences against India rather than counter-terror operations, it was also upset by the timing of the deal.\n\nSenior officials said the F-16 sale came even as India was hoping to keep the pressure on Pakistan to deliver action on the Pathankot terror attack.\n\nAsked if the U.S. decision and rejection of India\u2019s concerns went against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s statement that India and the U.S. were \u201cnatural allies,\u201d Mr. Parrikar told journalist Karan Thapar, \u201cThere are ups and downs in all relationships. Overall the relationship has improved a lot. Of course, this [F-16 sale] is a [down]. We don\u2019t accept this deal and that is what we have told the U.S.\u201d",
