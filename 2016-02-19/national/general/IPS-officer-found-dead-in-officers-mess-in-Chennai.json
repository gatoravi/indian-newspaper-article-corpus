    "text": "An IPS officer was found dead at the Police Officers Mess here on Thursday. N. Harish, a 2009 batch IPS officer, is suspected to have committed suicide by consuming anti-depressant pills along with alcohol, though police sources said clarity on the cause of death would emerge only after a post-mortem.\n\nInvestigators, however, have not ruled out the possibility of a natural death.\n\nHarish, a native of Bangalore, was serving as Assistant Superintendent of Police in the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption here. Earlier he served as Assistant Commissioner of Police, Tallakulam, Madurai.\n\nEnquiries revealed that Harish was depressed over the fact that his batch mates were promoted to the rank of Superintendent of Police while he remained an ASP. The body was shifted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for post-mortem.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday morning, he did not come out for breakfast. There was no response on the intercom or his mobile phone. Sensing trouble, the mess staff alerted the local police who opened the door and found the officer lying dead on his bed,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nAccording to a batch mate, Harish was depressed over some issues even at the National Police Academy in Hyderabad. \u201cHis friends tried to bring him out of it, but often failed. At times, he was sent to his hometown and his parents used to drop him back after a few days,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe is suspected to have high blood pressure. We will be perusing his phone call records as part of the investigation,\u201d said an officer.\n\nHarish was supposed to have got married in a month\u2019s time, his family members said.\n\nHis father Nagaraj and brother-in-law Anil came to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cHe was a very friendly person and was not addicted to alcohol as is being made out now. He never complained about any pressure from his superiors to us,\u201d said Anil speaking to The Hindu . He said that he had seen the body and that there were no injuries on it.",
