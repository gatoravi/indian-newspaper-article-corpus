    "text": "More than three years after Hamid Nehal Ansari, an engineer from Mumbai, landed in Pakistan custody, diplomatic sources on Thursday confirmed that India had sought consular access to Mr.Ansari. The Pakistan army had earlier acknowledged that Mr.Ansari was in their custody and was being court-martialled for undisclosed charges.\n\n\u201cThe details of the case of Hamid Nehal Ansari have not been shared with us by Pakistan. We have, therefore, asked Pakistan to provide us more information about the case. We have also asked for consular access to Mr.Ansari\u201d, said an official, explaining that the government was aware of the complex nature of the case and the difficult road ahead before India to get access to Mr.Ansari.\n\nThe Hindu had earlier reported that Mr.Ansari had been missing since late 2012 and was understood to have been arrested by the Pakistani forces when he ventured into the tribes-dominated North West Frontier Province.\n\nTrack II sources said that Mr.Ansari had gone to Afghanistan looking for a job in the airport sector but his real intention was to meet his online love interest, who was believed to be a resident of North West Pakistan. Officials told The Hindu that the case was not yet discussed by Pakistan with India at an official level and it would take some time before Pakistan was persuaded to share details of the case with Indian diplomats.",
