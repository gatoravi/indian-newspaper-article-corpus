The event we found appears considerably older than that,,\u201d said Prof. Siepel.\n\n\u201cOne interesting thing about our finding is that it shows a signal of breeding in the \u2018opposite\u2019 direction from that already known,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is, we show human DNA in a Neanderthal genome, rather than Neanderthal DNA in human genomes.\u201d\n\nThis finding, the result of several kinds of advanced computer modelling algorithms comparing complete genomes of hundreds of contemporary humans with complete and partial genomes of four archaic humans, has implications for our knowledge of human migration patterns.\n\nPeople of European, Eurasian and Asian descent have well-identified Neanderthal-derived segments in their genome.\n\nThese fragments are traces of interbreeding that followed the \u201cout of Africa\u201d human migration dating to about 60,000 years ago. They imply that children born of Neanderthal-modern human pairings outside of Africa were raised among the modern humans and ultimately bred with other humans, explaining how bits of Neanderthal DNA remain in human genomes.\n\nOutside Africa\n\nContemporary Africans, however, do not have detectable traces of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes.\n\nThis indicates that whatever sexual contact occurred between modern humans and Neanderthals occurred among humans who left the African continent.\n\n\u201cAncestors of present-day African populations likely didn\u2019t have the opportunity to interbreed with Neanderthals, who lived largely outside of Africa,\u201d said co-author Ilan Gronau, a former member of Prof. Siepel\u2019s Lab who is now at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Centre, Israel.\n\nThe team\u2019s evidence of \u201cgene flow\u201d from descendants of modern humans into the Neanderthal genome applies to one specific Neanderthal, whose remains were found some years ago in a cave in south-western Siberia, in the Altai Mountains, near the Russia-Mongolia border.\n\n\u201cThe signal we are seeing in the Altai Neanderthal probably comes from an interbreeding event that occurred after this Neanderthal lineage diverged from its archaic cousins, a little more than 1,00,000 years ago,\u201d Prof. Siepel added.\n\nThe study appears in the journal Nature . \u2014 PTI",
