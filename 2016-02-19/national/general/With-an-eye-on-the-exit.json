You won\u2019t find it in the medical books, but it\u2019s a real condition, whose symptoms include (a) the gentle drooping of eyelids some 30 minutes into a movie, (b) the mild panic that you have an hour (or three) to go, and (c) the anxious calculation of how many feet you\u2019re going to step over if you make a bolt for the exit.\n\nFestival Fatigue doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the actual quality of the film. Eug\u00e8ne Green\u2019s Le Fils de Joseph ( Son of Joseph ; French) was turning out to be pretty good, with its story, about a boy who wants to find out who his father is, divided into chapters with appropriately Biblical titles: \u2018Son of Abraham\u2019, \u2018The Golden Calf\u2019 and so forth. But even the always welcome presence of Mathieu Amalric, who plays a slimy publisher (there\u2019s something about that face that keeps lending itself to slimy characters), couldn\u2019t keep me awake.\n\nIt was the same story with another French film, Dominik Moll\u2019s Des Nouvelles de la Plan\u00e8te Mars ( News from Planet Mars ), which begins with Titan II blasting off in black-and-white footage, over an announcer\u2019s excitement: \u201cThrough the magic of the camera, earthlings take their first ride into space.\u201d\n\nThe title, however, comes from a decidedly grounded 49-year-old \u2014 it\u2019s just that his name happens to be Phillipe Mars (Fran\u00e7ois Damiens). And he just happens to be a little spaced out, having to deal with a son who\u2019s become a vegetarian and claims he\u2019s \u201csick of this castrative society,\u201d a daughter who won\u2019t stop studying and thinks her father is a loser (\u201cthe opposite of winner,\u201d the son helpfully explains), and a colleague who slices his ear off with a meat cleaver. During surgery to reattach the ear, Phillipe sees his dead parents. You\u2019d think that would be enough to keep me from eyeing the exit, but...\n\nThomas Vinterberg\u2019s Danish drama Kollektivet ( The Commune ) was a bit of a disappointment given his earlier outings ( The Celebration and, especially, The Hunt ). Anna (Trine Dyrholm), a famous television newscaster, tells her husband Erik (Ulrich Thomsen) that she wants a change. \u201cYou\u2019re sweet and you make me laugh, but I need to hear someone else speak.\u201d Their solution? Invite like-minded people into their large house and live in a commune. Under the hippie surface, however, there is streak of puritanical finger-wagging \u2014 this is a be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable.\n\nWhen Erik falls for a younger woman, Anna begins to question the wisdom of her decision. She wants to be the kind of woman who will welcome her husband\u2019s lover into their home (\u201cwe\u2019ll work something out\u201d), but is that kind of sharing humanly possible?\n\nAnna\u2019s plight is wrenching, but Ang Lee\u2019s The Ice Storm did a far better job of reminding us that our desire to be hip wanderers is often constrained by the ball and chain of society\u2019s conservative programming.\n\nRafi Pitts\u2019s brilliant Soy Nero (English, Spanish) begins with a laugh-out-loud anecdote about a sexual encounter between an ant and an elephant. This is another be-careful-what-you-wish-for fable, about immigrants (aka ants) who seek to acquire a green card by volunteering for military service.\n\nNero (Johnny Ortiz), who\u2019s Mexican but who insists he\u2019s basically from Los Angeles, crosses the border to be with his brother, who lives in a gated mansion that looks like Al Pacino\u2019s digs in Scarface \u2014 times two . There\u2019s a stuffed zebra. The bathroom is the size of Mexico. It\u2019s the American dream \u2014 or is it? Soon, a white family returns from vacation, and Nero realises his brother merely works there. The embarrassed brother has to turn Nero out. Over a parting hug, he says, \u201cBe safe, all right?\u201d And we cut to Nero in a desert warzone, (as the brochure puts it) \u201cfighting for his citizenship with a machine gun in his hand.\u201d\n\nOut there, for a while, Nero \u2014 as a representative American \u2014 becomes lord and master. \u201cCan I see some ID?\u201d he asks locals who want to go past his station. It\u2019s the slyest of jokes, for back in the US, Nero was the one constantly being asked the same question... by white cops. But the equations aren\u2019t all that different. We\u2019re still talking about brown and black soldiers doing all the dirty work under a white sergeant (who seems a distant figure), and we\u2019re still seeing Nero being searched and cuffed after an operation goes awry. Pitts fills the soundtrack (even in the pre-war portions) with the hum of helicopters \u2014 it\u2019s an awful omen, an even more awful reminder that you are always under surveillance",
