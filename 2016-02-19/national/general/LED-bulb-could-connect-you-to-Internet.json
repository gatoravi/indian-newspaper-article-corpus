The system also allows users to move from one light source to another without losing their network connection.\n\nWhat about connecting to the Internet in the night? The stream of photons can be reduced to a minimal level that won\u2019t produce visible light but enough to carry data.\n\nProf. Haas said though Li-Fi was poised to compete with Wi-Fi, it was not meant to replace it.\n\n\u201cWe are not looking at an either-or situation.\u201d\n\nThough the inability of light rays to pass through walls and similar structures is seen as a major drawback of this technology, Prof. Haas has a totally different view.\n\nHe said it is an advantage since restriction by walls provides more security to the network and eliminates the risk of the signal leakage to eavesdropping.\n\nThe Li-Flame, described as the world\u2019s first true Li-Fi system, was displayed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March last year. The third generation of the product has now been developed and will be on display at the MWC later this month.",
