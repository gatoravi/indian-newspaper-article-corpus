    "text": "BJP MP from North Mumbai Gopal Shetty said on Thursday that his words were misconstrued. This came a day after his reported remark that farmer suicides were a \u201cfashion\u201d became controversial. The party found itself in an embarrassing situation as Mr. Shetty\u2019s comments coincided with a pro-farmer rally in Madhya Pradesh the same day.\n\n\u201cNot all farmer suicides are because of hunger and unemployment. There is a fashion, a trend is on. If the Maharashtra government is giving Rs 5 lakh, another government is giving Rs. 7 lakh, Rs. 8 lakh. There is a competition to give money to farmers,\u201d Mr Shetty had said on Wednesday.\n\nWith the BJP distancing itself from his comments, Mr. Shetty sought to clarify, saying he did not mean to hurt anyone and had erroneously used \u2018fashion\u2019 instead of \u2018competition.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was saying that the previous governments haven\u2019t paid attention to the crisis, as a result of which farmers are facing problems. I said there is competition among State governments, but instead of \u2018competition\u2019, I used the word \u2018fashion\u2019. Now it has become an issue,\u201d he said, after the Opposition took him and the BJP on over his remarks.\n\nAccording to numbers provided by the Maharashtra government to the Bombay High Court, the Marathwada region has recorded 124 farmer suicides in January 2016 alone. Two days ago in court, Advocate-General Shrihari Aney accepted that the State government is falling short in providing relief, and blamed incompetent officials for this.",
