    "text": "In a move aimed at checking exam-related malpractices, the Mahatma Gandhi University of Kerala has asked the managements of colleges affiliated to it to set up CCTVs in exam halls before June 30. Notices have been sent to the colleges to implement the proposal before the deadline.\n\n\u201cWe will not allot exam centres to colleges that fail to comply with the guideline. All colleges, including self-financing institutions, have to install CCTVs inside examination halls before June 30,\u201d Vice-Chancellor Babu Sebastian told The Hindu .\n\nThe move is part of the varsity\u2019s decision to implement the recommendation made by Governor P. Sathasivam, who is also the Chancellor of universities, to improve transparency in the conduct of examinations, particularly at self-financing institutions. Vice-Chancellors were told to closely monitor the conduct of examinations.\n\nThe colleges have to get the facility certified by a government agency and submit an action taken report.\n\nMr. Sebastian said the varsity had tried implementing the Chancellor\u2019s recommendation earlier. \u201cOur original plan was to implement the proposal before December 31. The self-financing colleges had challenged it, but the court later directed the colleges to abide by the varsity directive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe colleges would collect the visuals and store it in a centralised facility. It could be played to ascertain whether any candidate had indulged in copying. Invigilators could also hand it over to the varsity authorities as proof in cases related to exam-cheating.",
