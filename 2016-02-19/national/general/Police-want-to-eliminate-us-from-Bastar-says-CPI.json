    "text": "Senior Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and former Chhattisgarh MLA Manish Kunjam has accused the police of \u201cplotting to eliminate\u201d his party cadre from the restive Bastar region.\n\nIn a press statement here on Thursday, Mr. Kunjam said: \u201cIt appears that the Bastar police and the administration want the CPI cadre to clash with Maoists and get eliminated in the process. During the time of Salwa Judum (an anti-insurgency militia), CPI leaders and party workers were targeted by Maoists in Bijapur and Konta areas of Bastar, resulting in the near-end of the party in these places. The administration wants to ensure that the people (CPI) who have been fighting for tribal rights in Bastar should be finished.\u201d\n\nHis statement came after some policemen in plainclothes allegedly joined a CPI rally in Sukma district and raised \u201canti-Maoist\u201d slogans.\n\nWhen contacted for his reaction to Mr. Kunjam\u2019s allegations, Bastar range Inspector General of Police RP Kalluri did not respond.",
