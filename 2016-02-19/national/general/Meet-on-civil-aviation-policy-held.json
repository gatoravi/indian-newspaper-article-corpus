    "text": "Six months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an \u2018informal meeting\u2019 on the country\u2019s draft civil aviation policy, Home Minister Rajnath Singh held a meeting with six other Cabinet Ministers on Thursday to discuss the final contours of the policy, which has so far been silent on the grant of foreign flying rights to local carriers, an issue that has split the airline industry down the middle.\n\nChaired by Mr. Singh, the meeting was attended by Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju and his deputy Mahesh Sharma, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, Power Minister Piyush Goyal and Skill Development Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy as well as Civil Aviation Secretary R.N. Choubey, official sources said.\n\nThe assembly comes a day after senior executives of private airlines sought the intervention of Minister of State-Prime Minister\u2019s Office Jitendra Singh on various issues mentioned in the draft policy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA), which lobbies for leading airlines, including IndiGo, Jet Airways, SpiceJet and GoAir, is knocking on the doors of various government offices to raise concerns over a few proposals in the draft policy, including the contentious 5/20 rule for flying abroad.\n\nOn Thursday, FIA members met Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the same issues. Sources said the FIA has also sought a meeting with Prime Minister\u2019s Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra.",
