    "text": "\u201cDuring the Malda riots, people were raped and looted... Nobody brought it here. Recently, the Delhi High Court was locked by lawyers on strike... is that not alarming too,\u201d R.P. Luthra, an advocate, asked the Supreme Court on Thursday when it agreed to hear the bail petition of JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\n\u201cAlarming or not... this court will hear this petition... Everybody should remember that administration of justice is fair,\u201d shot back Justice Chelameswar, sitting on the Bench with Abhay Manohar Sapre.\n\nIn his petition, Mr. Kumar, represented by senior advocates Soli Sorabjee and Raju Ramachandran and advocate Vrinda Grover, said he was supposed to move the magistrate court for bail on February 17, but was thwarted by the mob.\n\nHe was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. Mr. Kumar has sought bail and release from custody under Article 32 of the Constitution. Article 32 is an extraordinary judicial relief sought from the highest court when a citizen seeks protection of his fundamental rights, including his life and personal liberty.\n\nThe Delhi High Court and the lawyers\u2019 team, which was sent by the Supreme Court to the Patiala House to take stock of the extent of violence, filed their reports in sealed covers.\n\nMr. Kumar argued that there has been an \u201cexceptional and unprecedented breakdown of the justice delivery mechanism and administration of justice even after the writ of the Supreme Court.\u201d The petition said the failure of the Delhi Police to provide security on February 15 and 17 was in violation of the fundamental rights of the student, his lawyers and journalists.",
