    "text": "Mahesh Sharma, the president of the Bar Association, told The Hindu that the march was being organised to express the lawyers\u2019 unflinching dedication to national integrity, and added that denigration of the country would not be tolerated.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanjeev Nasiar, convener of the Co-ordination Committee of All District Bar Associations of Delhi, said that the lower courts\u2019 lawyers will on Friday march around the India Gate round-about and protest against the media for decrying them as \u201cgoondas in black coats\u201d. He said the government should crush anti-national voices in the bud.\n\nA resolution was also adopted urging the Delhi High Court to put in place a system to ensure that no other persons except litigants, their advocates and journalists are allowed entry to the lower courts to avoid clashes in the future.\n\nMr. Nasiar attributed the violence on the court premises to the presence of unauthorised persons in the courtroom where Kanhaiya Kumar was produced.\n\nThere should be a proper investigation into the incidents and the responsible persons should be punished, Mr. Nasiar said, adding that the co-ordination committee had so far received no complaint against any lawyer.",
