    "text": "Medaram, a sleepy village in the dense forests of Eturunagaram in Warangal district of Telangana, whose population is barely a few hundred, was flooded with people for the popular Sammakka Sarakka Jatara on Thursday.\n\nIt was a sea of humanity. Virtually every inch of space around the Medaram village and surrounding villages was occupied by people. They raised temporary sheds and makeshift kitchens and ate, drank and dozed off in the open. Serpentine queues were found all over proceeding towards the main altar where the tribal priests installed goddess Sammakka and Sarakka to enable the devotees to pay their obeisance.\n\nThere were brand new transformers supplying uninterrupted power, which is a rarity in normal times. There was water gushing out from hundreds of taps, again a rarity, a brand new APSRTC bus bay came up in a bamboo field and there was a helipad too! As plumes of red dust rose, women believed to be possessed by the goddess danced in a trance. People set up jungle camps everywhere and enjoyed the outing.\n\nEvery two years, tribals of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha undertake what is nothing short of an odyssey as they travel in bullock carts for days together to reach Medaram and pay obeisance to the legendary Koya tribal saints Sammakka and Sarakka, who became martyrs fighting the imperial armies of the Kakatiya monarch Pratapa Rudra II eight centuries ago.\n\nTribals from many States converge on Medaram for the Sammakka Sarakka Jatara every 2 years",
