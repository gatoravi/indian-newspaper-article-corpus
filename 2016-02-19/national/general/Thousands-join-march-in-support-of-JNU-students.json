Holding placards that read \u2014 \u201cLong live JNU\u201d, \u201cStand with JNU\u201d, \u201cOppose attack on right conscience\u201d, \u201cI am Kanhaiya\u201d and \u201cI am Umar\u201d, people marched from Mandi House to Parliament Street.\n\nA large number of them also held roses in their hands and raised them in the air at the start of the march. Even as some people initially had reservations about taking out such a march outside the university, due to security concerns of the students, the march finally ended up violence-free.\n\n\u201cJNU has always been a very vibrant campus. All kinds of voices have always been allowed in the campus, we believe in debating and accommodating other people\u2019s views, even if we disagree with them. And what has been done to Kanhaiya and the way police have been allowed to crack down on our university is completely unacceptable, and we will not take things lying down. We stand in solidarity with Kanhaiya, and demand his immediate release,\u201d a JNU student said. Students from Delhi University, Jamia Milia Islamia, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Allahabad University, Hyderabad University, Aligarh Muslim University and various other institutes joined the agitation.\n\n\u201cWe have been receiving support and solidarity from campuses across the country. And today, in this unprecedented show of solidarity, oceans of people from different organisations marched with students and teachers to reclaim the streets of Delhi from the ongoing ABVP-RSS-BJP campaign of terror, intimidation and slander\u201d, said Shehla Rashid, vice-president, JNU students\u2019 union. \u201cIt was necessary to reclaim the streets of Delhi for JNU students after the negative atmosphere that has been created against the students from the institution,\u201d Anant Kumar, another JNU student said.",
