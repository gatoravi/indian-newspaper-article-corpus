It was during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government (1998-2004) that the first constructive attempt towards crop insurance scheme was made. But later, the UPA government made changes to the scheme following which the farmers lost faith in the scheme and did not benefit\u201d, Mr.Modi said.\n\n50% coverage targeted\n\n\u201cIt was due to lack of faith in the earlier schemes that not more than 20 per cent of the farmers were associated with it\u201d, said Mr.Modi, adding that his government targeted covering at least 50 per cent of all farmers under the new scheme.\n\n\u201cThe new scheme will address all apprehensions of farmers as we have removed all discrepancies of previous insurance schemes,\u201d he said, adding that under new scheme, there was no cap on claims, while there is a cap of 2 per cent on premium, unlike the premium of up to 14 per cent in earlier schemes.\n\nExplaining the benefits of this comprehensive crop insurance scheme to the farmers, Mr.Modi said earlier, the farmers would get compensation only when 50 per cent of the crop was damaged due to natural calamity, but now, the norms had been relaxed and compensation would be given even if the damage was caused to one-third of the crop area.\n\nPTI reports\n\nMr.Modi that even if a crop was damaged up to 14 days after the harvest, farmers would get the insurance claim.\n\nAlso, even if only a single farmer was affected in a village, the insurance would be granted to him/her.",
