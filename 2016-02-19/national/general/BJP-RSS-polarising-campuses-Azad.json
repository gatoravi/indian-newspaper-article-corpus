I have said it earlier, too, that there is a modus operandi behind what is happening at Indian universities. Whether it is Delhi or Hyderabad, and even in West Bengal. There may have been 10 or 15 boys in that incident at JNU who may have raised slogans against India. We don\u2019t know whether they were students of that university. What about thousands of other students who are being branded because of this.\u201d Answering a question on the BJP hoping to appropriate the nationalism plank through the JNU incident, Mr. Azad compared it to the story about the camel and the tent. \u201cHave you heard the story of the camel and the tent? In our [the Congress] case, we are the owners of the tent of patriotism, the secular tent, having preserved it in heat and rain, and the BJP is the camel that is trying to appropriate the tent from us when good days are there.\u201d\n\nMr. Azad said Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s impromptu visit to the JNU campus in the wake of the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar was recognition of the fact that the BJP and the RSS were deliberately undermining student bodies other than their own.\n\n(For full text of interview visit http://bit.ly/1R9KL1h)",
