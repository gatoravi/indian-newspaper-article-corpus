    "text": "Bhatkal town was tense after several Muslim organisations condemned the inflammatory statement made BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde and demanded action against him. In a memorandum submitted to Uttara Kannada SP C. Vamsi Krishna, Majlise-Islah Wa Tanzeem, Bhatkal, general secretary, Altaf Kharuri said Mr. Hegde\u2019s statement was malicious. It was aimed at creating a law and order problem, he said and urged the police to thoroughly investigate the matter.\n\nAt a press conference in Bhatkal on Tuesday, Mr. Kharuri condemned Mr. Hegde\u2019s statements against Islam and accused him of trying to target Muslims to safeguard his political base. Mr. Hegde\u2019s dream of \u201ceradicating Islam from this world\u201d would never be realised. He said he would initiate all possible action against Mr. Hegde within the framework of law, and appealed to the Muslim community not to pay heed to such statements.",
