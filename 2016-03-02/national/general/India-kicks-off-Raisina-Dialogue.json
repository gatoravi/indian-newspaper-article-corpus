Mahboob Ali at the first \u2018Raisina Dialogue\u2019, hosted by the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi.\n\n\u201cIndia-Pakistan conflicts have prevented regional integration,\u201d Ms Kumaratunga said in her keynote address, adding that not just India and Pakistan, but \u201csix of eight SAARC countries (omitting Bhutan and Maldives) have spent the past decades consolidating their identities and inter-state tensions.\u201d\n\nThe conference, attended by speakers from 40 countries, is being seen as the government\u2019s attempt to rival conferences around the world that attract global players such as the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore, and the Munich Conference on national security. While Ms. Swaraj didn\u2019t mention India\u2019s relationship with China during her speech on Asian connectivity, other leaders on the panel made a point of speaking about China\u2019s role.\n\nMs. Kumaratunga called for a more positive view of China\u2019s role in the region, saying that all countries could benefit from doing business with China. \u201cCould we not see Chinese economic power as an opportunity rather than a threat?\u201d Ms. Kumaratunga asked, referring obliquely to concerns in India over projects built by China in Sri Lanka, especially the Colombo port project that was stalled temporarily last year.\n\nMs. Kumaratunga was joined by former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai in the pitch for a greater role for Chinese investment.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration, Ms. Swaraj and her Bangladesh counterpart Mahboob Ali spoke of the importance of building road and rail connectivity through the \u201cBBIN\u201d grouping of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. \u201cIf we are able to achieve this vision of connectivity, Asia-Pacific would account for half the world\u2019s output,\u201d Mr. Ali said.",
