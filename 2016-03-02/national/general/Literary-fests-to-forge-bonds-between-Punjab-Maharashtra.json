Mr. Nahar said the theme of conservation of regional languages was taken up in response to English literary fests across the country, such as the Jaipur and Hyderabad literary festivals.\n\nThe literary totem of the Ghuman fest is the 14th century Varkari poet-saint Saint Namdev, who is said to have spent a significant part of his later life in Punjab. While the Sikhs, who have built a shrine for the saint at Ghuman, insist that he died there (about 1350 C.E.), the fact is historically disputed.\n\nThree-day event\n\nLast year, the three-day festival at Ghuman witnessed a grand confluence of cultures, with nearly 7,000 poets and writers across Maharashtra congregating at the event, which also found a robust and enthusiastic audience in the people of Punjab.\n\nThe World Punjabi Literary festival is being organised as a tribute to the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, whose 350th birth anniversary is due in December this year.\n\nThe salient points of the literary festival include a discussion on relation of Punjabi language with other languages, a poetry meet and discussion on works of Guru Gobind Singh.\n\n\u201cPunjabi artistes such as Jaswant Zafar, Gurubhajan Singh Gill and Anup Kumar have expressed their willingness to participate. Besides, the Punjabi Sahitya Akademi and other Sikh organisations across the world have ensured their full support to the festival,\u201d said Mr. Nahar.\n\nThe theme is renewal and restoration of Urdu, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Bodo and Hindi",
