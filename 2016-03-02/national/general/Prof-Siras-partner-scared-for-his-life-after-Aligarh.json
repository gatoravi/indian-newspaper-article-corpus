    "text": "Sarfaraz (name changed), the rickshaw puller of Aligarh, is scared that he may be attacked. The reason is that the film Aligarh reveals his identity. The movie not only reveals his actual name but also the place where he stays with his family in Aligarh.\n\nSarfaraz was the gay partner of Aligarh Muslim University professor Shrinivas Ramchandra Siras on whose gay relationship the movie has been made. The film was released last week. Despite severe opposition by local groups in Aligarh, the movie was reportedly screened in a mall.\n\nTalking to The Hindu on the phone, Sarfaraz expressed the worry, which is keeping him preoccupied since the movie came out.\n\nThough not many knew about his identity since their relationship made the headlines in 2009, after the movie came out, he claimed that the small circle which knew about him had grown bigger. \u201cThis is not something welcome. I have not watched the movie but those who did, told me that my actual name has been used in the movie. They have also disclosed the name of the place where I stay in Aligarh,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, my life has been endangered because now people know my real name and the place where I stay. Of course that makes me scared for my life,\u201d Sarfaraz said, referring to the widespread protests against the movie by Hindutva and Islamist groups in Aligarh.",
