    "text": "Peter Rabbit on Monday became the first character from children\u2019s literature to appear on British coinage with author Beatrix Potter\u2019s creation featuring on 50-pence pieces commemorating her birth.\n\nA set of four fully-coloured coins will be released this year for the author\u2019s 150th birthday, with the first to carry an image of Peter Rabbit, her most recognisable creation.\n\nThe series will continue later in the year with three other characters from the much-loved Potter books.\n\n\u201cThe coins will be available in silver proof featuring a distinctive colour-printed design, bringing Peter and his famous blue jacket to life in vivid detail,\u201d said the Royal Mint.\n\nPlain-metal versions of the 50p pieces will appear in general circulation later this year. The illustrations were recreated by Royal Mint coin designer Emma Noble.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to be given the opportunity to work with such famous and treasured literary characters,\u201d said Noble.\n\n\u201cThey are lovely images and the characters are very well known,\u201d she added.\n\nThe author, who was played by Rene Zellweger in 2006 film Miss Potter , is best known for The Tale of Peter Rabbit , which has sold 45 million copies and been translated into 36 languages. \u2014 AFP",
