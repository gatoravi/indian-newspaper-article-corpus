Police investigations were based on the SMSes and e-mails between the accused and the 29-year-old victim. Police sources said the charge sheet named 23 persons as prosecution witnesses, who were likely to depose in court.\n\nThe witnesses include the complainant\u2019s friends and the present and former employees of TERI.\n\nThe sources said a supplementary charge sheet would be filed after the forensic reports of Mr. Pachauri\u2019s mobile phone and laptop computer were received as they would reveal the details of SMSes.",
