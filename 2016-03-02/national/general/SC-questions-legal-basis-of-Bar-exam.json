What is its basis without any statutory amendment?\u201d a Bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur and Justice U.U.

Conditions can\u2019t be put after enrolment. If, at all, it is required, the condition should be put at the enrolment stage,\u201d the Bench said.\n\nThe apex court has called for Law Commission reports on the issue of holding such an examination and posted the case for March 2.\n\nLaw graduates are required to clear the AIBE within two years in\n\norder to practise",
