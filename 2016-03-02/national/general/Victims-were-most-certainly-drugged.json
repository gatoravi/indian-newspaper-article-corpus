Blood splatter patterns on the walls also indicate the same, said sources. The police believe that had they retired for the day, eight members of a family would not have been sleeping in a single room when there was enough space.\n\nFurther, officials said, blood splatter on the walls was not more than a foot in height, and was spread in various directions.",
