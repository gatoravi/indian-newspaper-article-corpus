    "text": "National Conference working president and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Tuesday that the delay in government formation had adversely affected the political atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nOpening an office in his constituency Beerwah, Mr. Abdullah said: \u201cThe delay has thrown the State into an apparently indefinite period of uncertainty. The PDP\u2019s efforts to maintain ambiguity are based on the presumption that the delay can be marketed as a kind of moral stand that the party has suddenly found.\u201d\n\nHe said PDP president Mehbooba Mufti \u201cherself admitted that the people did not benefit from the 10-month PDP-BJP government. One wonders who the actual beneficiary of this alliance was. With every passing day, the uncertainty keeps growing; and this will have long-term implications for peace and stability for a State torn by conflict and political turmoil.\u201d\n\nMr. Abdullah accused the PDP of \u201cagain forming a government with those who were now openly advocating \u2018one, last open war\u2019 against the Muslims of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of the State have witnessed how the atmosphere in the State has been communally polarised since the PDP-BJP alliance came into being. Sometimes, truck drivers from Kashmir are burnt alive in Udhampur, and at other times, RSS members are allowed to brandish weapons and take out marches to harass and intimidate minorities. Is this the change the PDP had promised?\u201d he asked.",
