Five of the 10 have been occupied only after the conservation efforts helped the number of the scavenger birds go up from 10 to 30 in a span of two years.\n\n\u201cWe do not know when, but the nests were certainly abandoned because of shortage of food. A survey conducted in 10 surrounding villages revealed that cattle carcasses were not available since long, as farmers sell away their cattle,\u201d recalled Bejjur Forest Range Officer M. Ram Mohan, who leads the conservation effort.\n\n\u201cSupplying food to the vultures became our first priority as the habitat did not lack in the other two parameters for survival of the birds \u2014 availability of water and of higher perching places. We established a vulture restaurant on top of the cliff and on the Peddavagu stream bed to attract the scavengers to the habitat,\u201d Mr. Ram Mohan added.\n\n\u201cThough we had placed a carcass near the stream about six months ago, it was for the first time that the birds fed on it on February 20 and 21,\u201dsays wildlife biologist and field researcher M. Ravikanth. \u201cWe missed photographing the first day\u2019s action involving seven vultures but made sure we carried a camera the next day.\u201d\n\nThe habitat of the long billed vulture now has 24 adults and 6 chicks in 2 roosting points and 10 nests",
