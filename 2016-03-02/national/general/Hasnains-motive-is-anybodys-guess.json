The theory is based on not only the gruesome nature of the crime but also on certain beliefs that are prevalent in the village, said officials.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, Warekar killed 14 members of his family, including his parents, wife, daughter, sisters and their children, before hanging himself. Only one of his sisters, Subiya, survived the murderous assault, and is currently being treated for the slit on her throat and severe trauma.\n\nThe Thane police are looking into several possibilities with respect to the motive, and one of them is that Warekar was asked to conduct a \u201ccleansing\u201d ritual to rid him and his family of an evil spirit. \u201cThe residents of Kasarwadawali village are originally from Konkan, and a lot of their beliefs overlap with those of other communities. In some communities, it is believed that spirits reside on certain trees and anyone passing under them is likely to be possessed. During our inquiries in the village over the last couple of days, it has become apparent that the Kasarwadawali locals, too, believe in this,\u201d said an officer who is part of the investigating team.\n\nWhen The Hindu visited the village and interacted with the residents, some of them spoke about the concept of jinns or spirits.\n\nOne of the villagers, who did not wish to be named, said, \u201c Pata nahi itna shaant ladka aisa kyon karega. Jinn ne pakad liya hoga usko (Wonder why such a calm person would do something like this. It\u2019s as if a spirit caught hold of him).\u201d Other villagers said that according to local legend, jinns are either pak (pure) or napak (evil).\n\n\u201cThere are some people who indulge in aghori practices, which include necrophilia, cannibalism, black magic and occult. We are making efforts to find out whether Warekar came into contact with such a person or group. We are retracing his footsteps to find out which places he visited and who he was in regular contact with. The idea is to find out if the influence of any such occult practitioner, combined with the age-old belief shared by Wadavali natives, led to the crime. Our inquiries are under way in this regard,\u201d said another officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the police are also talking to experts to find out if any psychiatric condition can stay dormant for years and suddenly manifest itself in such an intense manner.\n\n\u201cThe problem with confirming whether or not Warekar was suffering from a psychological condition is the only ones who could confirm or deny this for sure are all dead. Any picture we try to build about his mental health would be based on secondary sources and educated guesses by experts,\u201d the officer said.",
