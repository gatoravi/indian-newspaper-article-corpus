    "text": "Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V.M. Sudheeran has expressed concern at the Union Budget\u2019s neglect of Kerala\u2019s agriculture sector.\n\nAddressing a meeting of the Karshaka Congress here on Tuesday, Mr. Sudheeran took strong exception to the Centre\u2019s disdain towards rubber growers as against the strong pro-active policy initiatives that the State government had undertaken. The Prime Minister had given assurances during his visit to the State a couple of months ago, but the budgetary provisions showed that these were mere words.\n\nThe State government had made a higher allocation for rubber procurement in its budget for 2016-17, up for Rs.300 crore last year to Rs.500 crore this time. The State Budget presented by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had packages for cardamom and coconut farmers, while the Central budget totally ignored them.",
