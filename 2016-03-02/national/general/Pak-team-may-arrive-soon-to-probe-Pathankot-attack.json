The Counter Terrorism Division (CTD) of the Pakistani Police arrested three suspects.\n\n\u201cThe Pakistani team will come here armed with a letter rogatory (LR) issued by a court there. The LR is required to probe the case on foreign soil. Since they have made a few arrests, we will have to provide them corroborative evidence. We will be asking them to provide us the details so that we can help in the investigation,\u201d the official said.\n\nHe said the team could come to India \u201cany time soon.\u201d \u201cWe are fully prepared to assist the Pakistani team. The decision to provide it access to the airbase will, however, be taken by the highest authority,\u201d he added.\n\nThe three accused arrested by Pakistan have been identified as Khalid Mahmood, Irshadul Haque and Muhammad Shoaib. They had allegedly facilitated the attack.\n\nMinister of State (Home) Kiren Rijiju told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday: \u201cA case has been registered [by Pakistan]. This is for the first time Pakistan has taken action. India had given evidence to Pakistan.\u201d",
