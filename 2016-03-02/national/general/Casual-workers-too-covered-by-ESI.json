The definition brings various types of employees within its ken. The Act is a welfare legislation and is required to be interpreted so as to ensure extension of benefits to the employees and not to deprive them of the same which are available under the Act,\u201d the Supreme Court held.\n\nFurther, Justice Mishra corrected the club\u2019s description of its race track employees. The judgment said the nature of their work was far from sporadic.\n\nIn fact, the apex court observed that the club\u2019s employees\u2019 work for the day of racing is a \u201cperennial activity\u201d which makes them entitled for the benefit of the Act.\n\nThis judgment is a sequel to an earlier verdict on the Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd on July 31, 2014 by the Supreme Court. In that, the apex court had held that the turf club would fall within the meaning of the word \u2018shop\u2019 as mentioned in the notification issued under the ESI Act.\n\nThe court held the club liable to pay the ESI contribution in the next three months as per notification dated September 18, 1978 along with interest at such rate as provided in the Act and the rules.\n\nIt further dismissed the applications of the club with costs of Rs. 2 lakh payable to the ESI Corporation.\n\nSC Bench dismisses race club\u2019s contention on definition of the term \u2018employee\u2019",
