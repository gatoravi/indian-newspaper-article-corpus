The government is trying to \u2018double tax\u2019 the employees. We are not going to accept this,\u201d BMS general secretary Virjesh Upadhyaya told The Hindu . If the decision was not reversed, the BMS would start a protest.\n\n\u201cThe gross salary of an employee is already taxed, then how can the government again tax a component of it that has been kept aside as a saving. We will take up the issue with the government,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Jaitley briefed the MPs of the ruling NDA on the budget. The Shiv Sena could not make it to the meeting because of miscommunication. According to those who attended the meeting, Mr. Jaitley spent considerable time, explaining the finer points of the issue. Whether the pressure from the allies and the ideological affiliates will have an effect on the government is to be seen.",
