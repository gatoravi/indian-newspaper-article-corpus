    "text": "Mounting a defence against AIADMK\u2019s attack in Parliament on Karti Chidambaram, son of former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, the Congress on Tuesday accused the BJP government of planting news to divert peoples\u2019 attention from the unrest at Jawaharlal Nehru University and the political repercussions it\u2019s facing after Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide.\n\n\u201cA jittery Modi government is using the modus operandi of news plants to divert Parliament's attention from its now exposed anti-Dalit/anti-student policies,\u201d said Congress party\u2019s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.\n\n\u201cThe attempt is obviously to distract attention from HRD Minister Smriti Irani misleading Parliament and the disappointing Budget which is inflationary.\u201d\n\nMr. Karti came under fire from AIADMK and the BJP over a newspaper article accusing him of having disproportionate real estate investments worldwide. Mr. Surjewala said Mr. Karti is a \u201cprivate individual\u201d and should not be targeted to score political points against his father, P.Chidambaram.\n\nMr.Surjewala also said if Karti is found guilty of any irregularity, the Union government or the AIADMK government in his home State Tamil Nadu should feel free to take action against him.",
