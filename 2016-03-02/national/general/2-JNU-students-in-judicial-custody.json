    "text": "A Delhi court on Tuesday remanded JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, facing sedition charges in connection with a controversial event organised on the university campus, in judicial custody for 14 days.\n\nBoth the students were produced before a Metropolitan Magistrate in a makeshift court room set up inside a police station in South Delhi on the expiry of their additional one-day police custody.\n\nPolice had obtained their custody with the contention that they were required for probe in order to unearth the \u201clarger conspiracy\u201d. The investigation in the case has since been transferred to the Special Cell of Delhi Police. The public prosecutor told the court on Tuesday that the accused students were not required for questioning any longer and they could be sent to jail in judicial custody.\n\nUmar and Anirban, who were in police remand since they surrendered on February 24, were interrogated in the presence of JNU Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar.",
