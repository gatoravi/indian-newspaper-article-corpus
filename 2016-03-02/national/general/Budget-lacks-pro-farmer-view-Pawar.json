    "text": "The former Agriculture Minister, Sharad Pawar, on Tuesday slammed the budget saying it lacked \u201cpro-farmer\u201d perspective.\n\n\u201cThe entire Budget was full of slogans,\u201d said Mr. Pawar at a press briefing here. \u201cWithout increasing the minimum support price of farmer\u2019s yield it is impossible to double their income by year 2022.\u201d The NCP leader said the allocation of Rs. 20,900 for the agricultural sector did not resolve farmer\u2019s concerns in times of drought since most of it would be spent on crop loans.\n\nOn the budget proposals, he said taxing 60 per cent of withdrawals from the Provident Fund and putting a ceiling on employers\u2019 contribution would \u201clead to unrest.\u201d Welcoming the government\u2019s move of increasing the funding for the MGNREGS, he said the make-work scheme had increased the spending capacity in rural areas and instead of scaling it down the policy should be encouraged.\n\n\u201c'Much has been talked against the MGNREGS, it is good that the government has realised its utility,\u201d Mr. Pawar said.",
