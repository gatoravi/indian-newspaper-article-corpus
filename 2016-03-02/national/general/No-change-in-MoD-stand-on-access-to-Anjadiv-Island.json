After completion of the North Break Water linking Binaga Point with the Anjadiv Island and establishing facilities, the permission to hold the feast was withdrawn due to security considerations.\n\nHowever, following representations from Goan devotees, Goa Congress MP Shantaram Naik had written to the Defence Ministry and raised the issue in Parliament. With reference to the Special Mention raised by the MP over granting permission for the celebration, the then Defence Minister A.K. Antony on March 7, 2007 replied that project Sea Bird at Karwar was strategically located in the area and that considering its sensitive nature, free access to civilians, irrespective of caste and religion, could not be granted.\n\nThe Minister said apart from law and order apprehensions, allowing free access involved serious security implications.\n\nMr. Naik told The Hindu on Tuesday that there had been no change in the position of the Defence Ministry on this issue.",
