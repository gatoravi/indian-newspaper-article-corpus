    "text": "G.K. Pillai has said an affidavit submitted to Gujarat High Court about LeT links of Ishrat was changed at the political level.\n\nAdvocate Manohar Lal Sharma, in his petition in the Supreme Court, seeking closure of all criminal proceedings against Gujarat police officers in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case, said the \u201cjudicial facts and evidence\u201d supplied by 26/11 accused David Headley through videoconference in the special court in Mumbai on February 11 proved that the four persons, including Ishrat, killed by the police were members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nThe then UPA government had submitted two affidavits \u2014 one that the four, who were killed in an alleged fake encounter, were terrorists, and the second saying there was no conclusive evidence \u2014 within two months in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe said facts are now undisputed/judicial facts. It is a judicial fact that all four persons, including of Muslim girl/lady Ishrat Jahan, killed by the Gujarat police are terrorists ... There is no prosecution under the Constitution as well as any Indian law for killing a terrorist,\u201d Mr. Sharma\u2019s petition said.\n\nGujarat police personnel, including the then DIG D.G. Vanzara, are facing trial in a Mumbai court for their alleged role in the encounter.\n\nMr. Sharma\u2019s petition said Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) does not extend to \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nIt asked the Supreme Court to issue a \u201cproper writ direction declaring that killing a terrorist is not an offence under the Indian law.\u201d\n\nThe petition also sought the court to direct that \u201cproper compensation be provided to the State police personnel in the interest of justice.\u201d",
