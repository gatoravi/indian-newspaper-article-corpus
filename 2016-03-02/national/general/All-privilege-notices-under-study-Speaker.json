    "text": "The ruling BJP and the Congress, with CPI(M), moved competing privilege motions in Parliament on Tuesday. While Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan read out the names of all those whose notices she had received, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya was allowed to speak on his notice, against chief whip of the Congress Jyotiraditya Scindia for defaming him on the Rohith Vemula issue.\n\nMr. Dattatreya accused Mr. Scindia of \u201ctarnishing\u201d his image by saying that he had called Rohith Vemula casteist and anti-national. \u201cMy mother used to sell onions. I have always worked for OBCs and Dalits. I have made sacrifices for Dalits,\u201d Mr. Dattatreya said.\n\nHe said his letter to Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, over which he has been attacked by the Congress, made no mention of Vemula\u2019s name. \u201cI never made such a charge against him.\u201d\n\nCongress members continued to protest, with K.C. Venugopal showing the rule book to the Speaker. \u201cDon\u2019t show me the rule book. I know,\u201d she shot back.\n\nShe said all the notices for privilege motion were under consideration.\n\nCPI(M) MP Mohammad Salim\u2019s privilege motion against Ms. Irani says the facts that she had presented, especially on the medical attention provided to Vemula, were incorrect and the validity of the inquiry process Ms. Irani had elaborated on with regard to JNU was also questionable.\n\nIn the Rajya Sabha, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad reminded the chair that the Congress had given notice of privilege motion against the HRD Minister and wanted to know its status.\n\nSmriti Irani\u2019s facts presented to Parliament all wrong, says CPI(M) MP Salim",
