His body was discovered near the radio in the cabin of a white yacht found last week by Filipino fishermen off the southeastern province of Surigao del Sur.\n\nThere were no visible signs of foul play, like a gunshot or stabbing wound, Mr. Plaza said.\n\n\u201cInitially, it looks to us that he died of natural causes, maybe a heart attack,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cAnd death appears to have come suddenly because he was still sitting by the table when he passed away.\u201d\n\nMr. Plaza said initial estimates show the man had been dead in the hot enclosed cabin for at least several days, but that authorities were awaiting an autopsy report due this week for a more accurate finding.\n\nThe 12-m-long sailboat\u2019s mast was broken, maybe in a storm, police said.\n\nDocuments found in the yacht showed that it was apparently owned by a German adventurer identified as Manfred Fritz Bajorat, Mr. Plaza said, adding that investigators still have to determine whether he was the dead man.\n\nMayor Felixberto Urbiztondo of Surigao del Sur\u2019s coastal town of Barobo, where fishermen towed the damaged yacht and the body was brought, said a daughter of Bajorat called to say her family was planning to travel to the Philippines to help investigators confirm whether the man was her father.\n\nIf the man was Bajorat, Urbiztondo said the man\u2019s family plans to have him cremated before bringing him back home. The German Embassy in Manila refused to comment and referred questions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin. \u2014 AP",
