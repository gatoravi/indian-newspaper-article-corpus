The sanctuary, which is the reserve for many different animals, stretches over an estimated area of 8,900 square km. It currently hosts nearly 155 Arabian Oryx, which were reintroduced into its natural habitat in the UAE in a five-year conservation plan launched by the country's late ruler, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, after it was feared it would be extinct.\u2014 Photo: AFP",
