The suspended legislators are Gopalpur MLA Neeraj Kumar Mandal alias Gopal Mandal and party MLC from Samastipur Rana Gangeshwar Singh.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Mandal said he was earlier doing \u201cpolitics of murder\u201d and, if provoked, would do it again. \u201c Main pehle hatya ki rajniti karta tha aur ab phir se hatya ki rajniti karunga aur karwaunga ,\u201d said Mr. Mandal at the inaugural ceremony of a \u2018kavi sammelan\u2019 (poets congregation) in Naugacchia of Bhagalpur. He declared that he had enough arms and ammunition to protect his people.\n\nMr. Gangeshwar Singh embarrassed the party while addressing a gathering on Tuesday on the occasion of Bihar Diwas. He put a question mark on the authenticity of the national anthem. \u201cOur national anthem needs to be changed as it appears to praise those who ruled he country,\u201d he said.",
