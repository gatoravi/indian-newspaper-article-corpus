    "text": "Date indicate why the metro is considered to be the epicentre of the tuberculosis epidemic\n\nOf the 5,000 cases of multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis recorded in Maharashtra in 2015, over 3,300 were from Mumbai \u2013 more than 60 per cent of the total cases in the State. These figures indicate why the metropolis is considered to be the epicentre of the tuberculosis epidemic.\n\nThe rising number of MDR cases has led the Sewri Tuberculosis Hospital, one of Asia\u2019s largest TB treatment facilities, to suggest that more centres with in-patient facility be opened in Mumbai, particularly in the distant suburbs, to both help patients get treatment close to their place of residence and also contain the spread of the disease, which is possible when patients travel long distances. For example, a patient from Borivali in the western suburbs has to travel more than 40 km to reach the Sewri medical facility. A patient from Vashi, Navi Mumbai, has to travel over 80 km.\n\n\u201cOf the 25,000 estimated cases of MDR-TB in India, 5,000 were in Maharashtra of which over 3,000 were in Mumbai alone,\u201d said Dr Rajendra T Nanavare, medical superintendent of the Group of TB Hospitals, Sewri. He said that while TB numbers had remained more or less steady, the number of MDR-TB cases were piling up, leading to a logistical concern. \u201cWe have only 200 beds for drug-resistant cases and they are packed at all times. For drug-sensitive cases, we have about 1,000 beds and their occupancy is 80-85 per cent at any point,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this reason, he said, there is a need to upgrade capacity and set up more centres. \u201cThane and Navi Mumbai, for instance, should have their own centres,\u201d Dr Nanavare said. \u201cThere is a possibility of spread of infection when patients travel this distance to the hospital.\u201d\n\nHe attributed general living conditions, slums, and significant migration for Mumbai\u2019s TB burden. Besides, he said, there are certain parts tuberculosis hotspots in Mumbai. \u201cThere is a need to decentralise (the TB facility),\u201d he said. While on the diagnostic front, Mumbai is almost well-equipped \u2013 there are 20 gene experts in the city for diagnosis \u2013 it falls short of doctors and health workers, and also adequate facilities to shoulder the load.\n\nGeneral living conditions, slums, and significant migration add to Mumbai\u2019s TB burden",
