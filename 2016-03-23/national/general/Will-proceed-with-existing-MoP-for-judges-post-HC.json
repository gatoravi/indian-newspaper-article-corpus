Veerabhadraiah, an advocate, had sought for a direction for disclosing names of persons who were being considered for the post of judges as the Supreme Court wanted transparency.\n\nHowever, the Bench observed that till the MoP was modified by considering suggestions received from various quarters, the stakeholders have decided to proceed with the existing MoP.",
