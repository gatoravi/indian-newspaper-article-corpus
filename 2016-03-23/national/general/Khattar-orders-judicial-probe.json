Strict and sufficient action will be taken against persons of criminal nature; innocent persons will not be unnecessarily harassed and all decisions will be taken on merit,\u201d Mr. Khattar said, adding that any police or administrative official found negligent in discharge of duties will not be spared.\n\nMr. Khattar said: \u201cIn February this year, after the demand for reservation, the incidents were undoubtedly unfortunate. But to say the incidents occurred due to wilful negligence on the part of the Haryana government is completely untrue and baseless.\u201d\n\nLast month\u2019s Jat agitation had left the State paralysed for over 10 days during which at least 30 people were killed, over 200 injured and property worth hundreds of crores destroyed. Following this, the BJP government in the State had promised reservation for the Jat community and others by bringing a Bill during the Assembly Budget session.",
