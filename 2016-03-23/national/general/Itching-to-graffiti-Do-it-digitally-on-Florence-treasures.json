    "text": "The walls of the almost 800-year-old Giotto\u2019s bell tower in Florence have been defiled down the ages by millions of messages left by people.\u2014 Photo: The New York Times\n\nThe days of scribbling \u201cI woz here\u201d on Florence\u2019s historic monuments are gone: from now on would-be vandals will be able to graffiti via app instead, with their messages kept for posterity.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Giotto\u2019s Campanile!\u201d reads a message on a digital tablet for visitors scaling the Gothic white, green and pink marble tower by the famed Italian architect, which stands at one corner of the Cathedral in the Tuscan city.\n\n\u201cWe have been protecting masterpieces for centuries: starting from today we are going to remove graffiti from the Campanile\u2019s walls. But if you \u2014 virtually \u2014 leave us a message, we will preserve it: just like a masterpiece,\u201d it says.\n\nThe walls of the 14th-century bell tower, which is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, have been defiled down the ages by millions of messages left by people climbing the 400 steps to enjoy spectacular views of red-tiled rooftops.\n\n\u201cThree months ago, when we began cleaning the walls, which had never been done before, we asked ourselves how we could avoid all the work going to waste in a short time,\u201d said Alice Filipponi, social media manager for Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, a not-for-profit organisation tasked with preserving many of Florence\u2019s monuments.\n\nArchitect Beatrice Agostini, who heads up the organisation\u2019s restoration arm, said the bell tower \u201cwas in an incredibly degraded and dirty condition\u201d, with all elements \u2014 marble, stone, wood and brick \u2014 damaged by graffiti.\n\nMs. Filipponi said she had \u201can idea for an app which would allow the visitor to choose the surface [marble or wood for example], the colour and the instrument they want to use [felt pen, paintbrush, aerosol] to leave a virtual message or drawing.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pietro was here\u2019\n\nThe application, which is named \u2018Autography\u2019 and launched last week, is \u201ca first,\u201d Ms. Filipponi said, adding that she hoped to sell it to other sites plagued by heritage hoodlums.\n\nThree digital tablets have been installed on the 1st, 3rd and 4th floors of the tower and the messages are stored online ( http://autography.operaduomo.firenze.it/ ). Over 700 personalised scrawls were collected in the first week.\n\nJust like on the tower\u2019s walls, where statues of kings and sibyls once stood, the messages range from declarations of adoration, despair over unrequited love and appeals for peace, to the simple \u201cPietro was here.\u201d\n\nThey will be printed out each year and filed away in the Cathedral\u2019s archives, alongside historic documents such as the deed appointing Renaissance designer Brunelleschi to build the Duomo\u2019s dome, and the birth certificate of Lisa Gherardini, widely considered to have been the model for Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa .\n\n\u201cThe idea was to raise awareness among visitors about vandalism, but also give them the chance to leave behind a record, an everlasting sign of their passing through, without damaging the monument,\u201d the Opera said in a statement.\n\nFrom smiley faces to hearts and doodled names, graffiti is the bane of restorers\u2019 lives and is laborious to remove.\n\nWhile the cleaning job on the tower\u2019s walls has managed to wipe off most of the pen or paint scribbles, words etched into the stone are still visible despite all efforts.\n\nUndeterred, conservators will turn their scrubbing brushes next year to the Cathedral\u2019s dome \u2014 the largest such structure in brick ever constructed \u2014 and install tablets with the Autography app there as well. \u2014 AFP",
