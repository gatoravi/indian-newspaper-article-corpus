    "text": "The West Bengal leadership of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) \u2014 a key Left Front constituent \u2014 is caught in a dilemma over the Left-Congress seat-sharing as the new foe-turned-friend of the alliance is contesting in nine of the traditional constituencies of the party.\n\nWhile the Congress\u2019s decision has left the RSP leadership fuming, the party is unable to act independent of the Left Front.\n\nAddressing presspersons on Tuesday, RSP State secretary Kshiti Goswami clearly reflected his party\u2019s dilemma. \u201cWe are disciplined soldiers of the Left Front and will go by the Front\u2019s decision,\u201d he said. However, he added: \u201cWe have been as flexible as possible and cannot do anything more ... it\u2019s a question of our political existence.\u201d\n\nCongress flayed\n\nHe criticised State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for accusing the RSP of \u201cthrowing a spanner\u201d in the seat-sharing negotiations. \u201cMr. Chowdhury\u2019s remarks are unfortunate and not conducive to the ongoing Left-Congress negotiations,\u201d said Mr. Goswami. Earlier Mr. Chowdhury had said: \u201cCPI(M) will have to accommodate them [the Front allies]. It is not our responsibility.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to send a message to the CPI(M) leadership, which strongly advocates the Left-Congress tie up, Mr. Goswami described the alliance as the \u201cmost temporary arrangement for votes\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is just to ensure that anti-Trinamool votes are not divided,\u201d he said.",
