    "text": "Subhash B. Adi, Upalokayukta-II, who has been precluded from discharging his duties, on Tuesday moved a Division Bench against the order of a single judge, which had dismissed his petition questioning the process adopted by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on the motion moved for his removal from the post.\n\nWhen the appeal, filed by Mr. Adi came up before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and Justice Ravi Malimath, the Chief Justice, owing to personal reasons, recused himself from hearing it saying it would be posted before another Division Bench.\n\nAs per the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, the Chief Justice of the HC or a judge of the HC designated by the Chief Justice will have to conduct the inquiry against the Lokayukta or the Upalokayukta on receipt of reference for enquiry from Speaker of the Assembly or Chairman of the Legislative Council. The single judge, in its March 2 verdict, said that judicial review of the proceedings, initiated for removal of an Upalokayukta, was not permissible until the order of his removal was passed by the Governor as per the KL Act provisions.",
