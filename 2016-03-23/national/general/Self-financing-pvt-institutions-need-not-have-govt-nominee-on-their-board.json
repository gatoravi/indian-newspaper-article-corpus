    "text": "Self-financing private institutions need not have a government nominee on their board of management, Union Minister of Human Resource Development Smriti Irani said here on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at the national conference on \u2018Making India a global hub for higher education\u2019, organised by the Education Promotion Society of India, she said if an institution had to engage with bodies such as the University Grants Commission (UGC), the UGC nominee would be selected in a well-structured search-cum-selection process to ensure that it remains transparent.\n\nHoping to end the \u2018license raj\u2019 of the AICTE, she said technical institutions need not run for approvals every year to the AICTE, and said accreditation of five years would be equated with a five-year approval. Ms. Irani also added that affiliated colleges receiving high NAAC grades would get autonomy if they get a nod from the State-affiliated university.\n\nShe also announced that the National Achievement Survey conducted once in three years will be done every year for all States. Ms. Irani said the NCERT would ensure that benchmarks are set for students in classes 1 to 8 so that schools would have a framework. She said collecting data every year would help in planning interventions.",
