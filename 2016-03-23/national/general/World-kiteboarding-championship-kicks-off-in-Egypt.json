Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, is a fast-emerging sailing sport in which riders strap themselves to a parachute-like kite and use the wind to pull them along while standing on a board attached to their feet, with speed records of over 50 knots.\n\nIt is a popular draw for foreigners to Egypt, where the tourism industry has been hit hard by years of instability since the country\u2019s 2011 uprising and the Army\u2019s subsequent 2013 ouster of Islamists that fanned a militant insurgency.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed the bombing last October of a Russian airliner flying from the Sharm el-Sheikh resort in the Sinai Peninsula across the Red Sea from el-Gouna that killed all 224 people onboard.\n\nFrance\u2019s current national champion, 21-year-old Antoine Fermon, who picked up the sport while growing up in Tahiti, said that the 10-strong French team received a warm welcome in El-Gouna and was not worried about security.\n\n\u201cWe arrived at the airport, the taxi came to pick us up, frankly without a single worry, and nobody talks of problems that are here,\u201d Fermon said. From Cairo, 28-year-old Ingie El Mor was the only Egyptian woman taking part in the tournament, competing in the \u201cbig air\u201d category.\n\n\u201cHere in Egypt we have the best conditions for kiteboarding, Egypt is already ranked one of the best kitesurfing spots in the world. The wind is constant, the water is flat so we have to use that,\u201d El Mor said. \u2014 AP",
