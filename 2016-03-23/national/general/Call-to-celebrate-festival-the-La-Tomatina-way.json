Besides playing Holi with tomatoes, people could buy them, dry them and powder them for future use, he said.\n\nThe aim was to create market demand and give a reasonable price to tomato growers and, at the same time, help revellers rejoice.\n\nStudents of STBC College, who were trained in deseeding, drying, and powdering tomato, would demonstrate the process during Holi on Wednesday, Mr. Reddy said.\n\nSplash-a-tomato concept is aimed at helping farmers in distress, says Save Hundri",
