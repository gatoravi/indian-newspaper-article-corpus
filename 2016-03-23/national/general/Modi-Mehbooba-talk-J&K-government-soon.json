    "text": "BJP general secretary Ram Madhav, at the centre of government formation efforts, had made it clear that the Agenda of the Alliance would be the only point of reference for government formation.\n\nAccording to sources in the BJP, that is exactly what has been promised. \u201cMost of the issues had already been sorted out, on the power projects in Uri and Dulhasti, and the vacating of land by the Army at Tattoo ground in Srinagar and near the Jammu airport,\u201d said a source. When attempts in the last two months did not bring things to a tipping point, the BJP even opened channels to at least one senior MLA and a Member of Parliament of the PDP to build pressure from within the party in favour of restoration of government. \u201cLocal bodies polls have been announced in J&K for May, and MLAs and other leaders saw no point in delaying government formation,\u201d said a source in the BJP.\n\nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley played his part in assuring the PDP that promises made to the State under the Agenda of the Alliance would be kept.\n\nIn Srinagar, while Opposition parties criticised what they termed Ms. Mufti\u2019s intransigence, PDP leader and former Minister Nayeem Akhtar said: \u201cTuesday\u2019s meeting was a culmination of a process and genuine polity. There were tangible moves on the ground, which we don\u2019t want to brag about. The real ice-breaker was assurances made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitley on implementation of the Agenda of the Alliance. We were always committed to the Agenda and wanted the BJP to stick to its earlier promises.\u201d",
