More than 85 per cent of the mammal species at high risk of extinction lack a fossil record, researchers found.\n\nThose at highest risk have about half the probability of being incorporated into the fossil record compared to those at lower risk.\n\nAnimals least likely to be found as fossils are \u201cthe small, cute and fuzzy ones, like rodents and bats,\u201d Prof. Plotnick said.\n\n\u201cBody size is an obvious factor \u2014 bigger things tend to leave a fossil record, as do things with larger geographical ranges,\u201d he said.\n\nViewed from the perspective of the fossil record alone, the magnitude of the current mammal die-off thus appears markedly reduced.\n\nThe picture may be even more distorted for other land-dwelling vertebrates \u2014 only 3 per cent of today\u2019s threatened bird species and 1.6 per cent of threatened reptile species have a known fossil record. Comparing the scale of the current extinction episode to earlier extinctions that are mostly calculated from the fossil record of hard-shelled marine invertebrates, is particularly problematic, although ancient extinctions may also be underestimated by contemporary palaeontologists, Prof. Plotnick said.\n\nNevertheless, fossils will provide the only reliable record of life on Earth for posterity, he said. \u201cThere are species going extinct today that have never been described. Others are going extinct that are known only because someone wrote it down.\u201d\n\n\u2014 PTI\n\nSmall, fuzzy animals such as rodents and bats are least likely to be found as fossils: study",
