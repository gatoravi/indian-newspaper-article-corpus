Every year, revellers find their wallets and cell phones missing.\n\n\u201cThe large crowds are also soft targets for terrorist elements,\u201d said an officer.\n\nAll-woman squads\n\nThe other major concern is molestation of women. \u201cWe will also have special all-woman squads deployed all over the city. Women can approach these squads for help,\u201d Mr. Bharti added.\n\nThe police will step up patrolling in the city from Wednesday night, and random checks of vehicles will be conducted to seize contraband. Anti-terror cells of all police stations had been instructed to keep their ears to the ground, the police said.\n\nPlainclothesmen and all-woman squads to be deployed across the city",
