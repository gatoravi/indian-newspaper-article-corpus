The attack on Belgium once again underscores the need to counter terror unitedly,\u201d said Vikas Swarup, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson at a briefing, as he announced Mr. Modi\u2019s visit.\n\nSeparately, the Prime Minister tweeted about the attacks, calling the news from Brussels \u201cdisturbing\u201d. \u201cThe attacks are condemnable. Condolences to families of the deceased. May those injured recover quickly,\u201d he said in the message.\n\nMr. Modi is scheduled to travel to Brussels next Wednesday on his way to the U.S., and will attend the European Union-India Summit and hold bilateral talks with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.\n\nOfficials told The Hindu that the summit, resuming after a break of four years, will see the resumption of talks on Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), as the Free Trade Agreement is known.\n\nClimate cooperation\n\nApart from the trade issues, talks with EU Council President Donald Tusk and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker will focus on EU support to India on climate change cooperation, clean water projects and in particular, the Namami Ganga project.\n\nOfficials are already in Brussels to discuss the meetings, including EU Ambassador to India Tomasz Kozlowski, who was reportedly among hundreds of EU officials caught in the aftermath of the explosions in Brussels and the lockdown across the city.\n\nShortly after the attack, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted that she had been in touch with India\u2019s Ambassador to the EU Manjeev Puri, saying there had been no report of any Indians being killed in Tuesday\u2019s blasts.\n\nHowever, official sources confirmed that two Indian citizens working with the Jet Airways were injured in the airport attack, including a woman crew member who had been taken to hospital. The Indian Embassy has set up a helpline number, +32-26409140, for citizens stranded in Belgium as all flights have been cancelled until Wednesday.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s visit will now be accompanied by heightened security concerns, said officials. Cooperation on fighting terror as well as deradicalisation and IS-related security issues are also likely to be highlighted during the bilateral meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, according to sources.\n\nApart from the bilateral meeting and the EU-India summit, Mr. Modi will attend an event organised for the Indian diaspora.",
