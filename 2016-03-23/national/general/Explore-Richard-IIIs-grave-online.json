The digital exhumation coincides with the first anniversary of Richard\u2019s reinterment last year in Leicester Cathedral. \u2014File Photo: AFP\n\nAt last, an archaeological dig you can explore from your sofa: Leicester University has launched an interactive digital reconstruction of the hasty grave and the distorted skeleton of one of England\u2019s most vilified monarchs.\n\nKing Richard III claimed the throne of England in June 1483. By 22 August 1485, at just 32 years of age, he lay dead on a battlefield at Bosworth, victim of multiple injuries, living on only as the notorious Richard Crookback in Shakespeare\u2019s take on the Wars of the Roses. And then in 2012, archaeologists found his body under a Leicester city council car park, known to be built over a site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory.\n\nLeicester University Archaeological Services has now released a computer model of the royal remains at rest in the hastily-dug pit in which the body was buried.\n\nThe model offers the opportunity, at the click of a finger, to exhume a monarch, observe the distorted spine, and note the awkward position of the head, enforced by the uneven base and sloping sides of the untidy grave.\n\nThe digital exhumation coincides with the first anniversary of Richard\u2019s re-interment last year in Leicester Cathedral, and is based on photogrammetry software used to turn two-dimensional photographs into a three-dimensional exploration.\n\n\u201cDuring the excavation in 2012, we took photographs of the skeleton from multiple angles to create a lasting record of how the king\u2019s bones were positioned in the grave before we exhumed them,\u201d said Matthew Morris, site supervisor of the team that found the missing king.\n\n\u201cThese photos were not taken with photogrammetry in mind, but the software is incredibly versatile and can be applied retrospectively to create this superb model.\u201d The do-it-yourself exhumation is just one of a series of events centred around the anniversary.\n\nRichard III: Discovered is an exhibition at Highcross that will run until Wednesday. And the university has launched a free online course on the life and times of Richard III, a exploration of an episode described as a time \u201chuge upheavals, including savage dynastic warfare, shifting allegiances among a powerful aristocracy, and significant depopulation.\u201d \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
