The CPI(M) leaders submitted a memorandum to Mr. Das, which called for the case to be referred to a Central agency as \u201cthere can be no confidence in the present investigation.\u201d The State police and the administration have so far denied the involvement of cow protection vigilantes in the murders. The victims, Mazlum Ansari (32) and Imteyaz Khan (13), were residents of Balumath.According to the CPI(M) leaders, Mazlum had been threatened by cow protection vigilantes who wanted him to give up cattle trading, and the story that his killing was due to a personal dispute was a falsehood propagated by the administration. The CPI(M)\u2019s memo to the Chief Minister also demanded strict action against police officials indulging in communally divisive hate speech, government employment for the wife of Ansari and parent of Khan, and a crackdown on \u201cthe communal activities of the so-called cow protection committees.\u201d\n\n\u2018No\u2019 to compensation\n\nSpecial Correspondent from Patna reports:\n\nThe families of the two cattle-traders, whose bodies were found hanging from a tree trunk on March 18 in the Latehar district of Jharkhand, have refused to take the financial assistance of Rs. 1 lakh from Chief Minister Raghubar Das.\n\nThe Collector and the Superintendent of Police went to the victim\u2019s village on Tuesday to hand over the assistance.
