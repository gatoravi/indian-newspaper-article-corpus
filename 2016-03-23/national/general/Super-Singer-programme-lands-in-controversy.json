    "text": "Star Vijay\u2019s popular reality television show, Super Singer, which completed nine seasons a few days ago, was trending on social media for all the wrong reasons. The channel has been accused of \u201chiding information about the participant\u201d to the audience after details emerged post the awards ceremony that the winner, Anand Aravindakshan, was already a \u2018playback singer\u2019.\n\nIt emerged that Anand Aravindakshan had already rendered a few songs in Tamil movies. Since the show has a reputation of finding new singing talent and giving them the exposure and platform to shine, social media users were critical of the channel not being upfront about the fact that a professional singer had participated in the show and accused the channel of wrongdoing. Actor and filmmaker Lakshmi Ramakrishnan, whose film \u2018Aarohanam\u2019 features a song sung by Anand Aravindakshan, wrote on Facebook saying that \u2018this cannot have happened without the channel\u2019s knowledge\u2019.\n\nCritics point out this year\u2019s winner is already a professional singer",
