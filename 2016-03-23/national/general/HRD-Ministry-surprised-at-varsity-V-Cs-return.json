Ministry officials said they were closely monitoring the situation. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Podile said his colleagues\u2019 insistence had made him return to work. \u201cTwo months is a long time and a lot of work needs to be done,\u201d Mr. Podile said, adding recruitments to both teaching and non-teaching staff had to be undertaken. Mr. Podile says his return is based on the understanding that the commission under retired Justice Ashok K. Roopanwal had almost concluded its work of speaking to all stakeholders of the campus.\n\nMr. Podile said his office had sent an email to the MHRD as soon as he decided to resume work.\n\n\u201cAs the students have broken my computer, I have not checked my mail or the response of the Ministry.\u201d\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor said he would consult the deans of schools before taking any action against the students who had ransacked his office. A month ago, a fact-finding report of the MHRD had noted that the administration had failed to engage with the striking students which had escalated the crisis. The judicial commission is expected to submit its report in April.",
