    "text": "A drama about an attack on a mosque is headlining the third Saudi Film Festival, which opens on Thursday amid hopes the conservative kingdom may finally allow public cinemas.\n\nThe modest festival, which will feature 70 productions in competition, is a far cry from the glitz and glamour of Western counterparts. The austere version of Islam practised in Saudi Arabia bans cinemas and other entertainment venues. But organisers hope the event, which will see screenings take place at an arts and cultural centre in the Gulf coast city of Dammam, will help develop the country\u2019s nascent film industry.\n\n\u201cWe try to raise the standards, to make it better,\u201d festival director Ahmed AlMulla said. The festival will culminate on Monday night with winners of the juried competition receiving its Golden Palm Tree awards.\n\nRakan AlHarbi\u2019s four-minute drama Their Stained Hearts will be one of three short films shown to hundreds of guests expected at the red-carpet opening gala.\n\nThe film tells the story of a \u201cmuseum for terrorists\u201d \u2014 where a visitor talks to the attacker of a mosque. \u2014 AFP",
