    "text": "Shiv Sena, NCP slam RSS; MNS warns of attacks on those who speak about breaking Maharashtra; BJP says it is Vaidya's personal opinion\n\nMaharashtra\u2019s Advocate General Shreehari Aney on Tuesday submitted his resignation to Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, two days after he demanded separate statehood for Marathwada, which evoked a sharp rebuke from the opposition as well as the Shiv Sena.\n\n\u201cShooting the messenger does not solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Aney said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cIn the present disruption of the legislature, I see a clear pattern. Since I shall not stop from voicing my demand for Vidarbha\u2019s statehood, the legislators will not stop from using it as a ready excuse to stall the working of the house; one of us has to step back.\u201d\n\nMr. Aney said the Advocate General\u2019s prime function is to protect the interest of the people. \u201cAnd that the legislature must function if the interest of the people is to be protected, my final act as Advocate General which would be most in the interest of the people of the state was to resign from the post.\u201d",
