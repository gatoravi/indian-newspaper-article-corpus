Their charred remains were all that could be retrieved from the building, which was blown up by the National Security Guard (NSG) during the Pathankot operation.\n\nThere was a debate on the number of terrorists present at the airbase as only four bodies were found there. The charred remains collected from the billet were sent for forensic examination. The tests conducted at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh, concluded the \u201cburnt mass material belonged to two men.\u201d Officials had earlier said it was not possible \u201cto establish the identity of the burnt male remains\u201d as the \u201cDNA could not be isolated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be sending the samples again for determining the DNA profile,\u201d said a senior official.\n\n\u201cIf the forensic tests have established that the charred remains belonged to a male body, then determining the DNA should not be difficult,\u201d a top forensic expert said.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that if there was \u201cexcessive charring\u201d, then the sample cannot be amplified and DNA cannot be determined.\n\nThe DNA samples of the four other terrorists will be handed over to the investigation team from Pakistan, which will come to India on March 27.",
