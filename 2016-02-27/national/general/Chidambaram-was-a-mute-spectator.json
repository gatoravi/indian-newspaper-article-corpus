Chidambaram defended \u201cholding a different opinion on Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru\u2019s execution,\u201d Guru\u2019s wife Tabasum Guru on Friday said these remarks were \u201ctoo late\u201d and aimed at \u201cvote bank politics.\u201d\n\nMs. Guru accused Mr. Chidambaram of \u201cacting as mute spectator\u201d when a decision to execute Guru was taken in 2013.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Mr. Chidambaram supported the execution of my husband. There is no need to issue such a statement now,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also accused the Congress government of disallowing \u201chanding over the personal belongings of Guru or his mortal remains.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are well aware that Afzal was not involved [in the Parliament attack]. Even the Supreme Court sentenced him to death saying \u2018to satisfy the collective conscience of Indian society\u2019,\u201d she added.\n\nVote bank politics\n\n\u201cPeople like Mr. Chidambaram are rubbing salt into our wound. It\u2019s for creating a vote bank in the name of Afzal. People involved in Guru\u2019s execution are now claiming that his case was wrongly decided,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Guru termed the move of JNU students \u201cto raise their voice against the hanging as a slap in the face of India.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Chidambaram told The Hindu that \u201cone can hold an honest opinion that the case was not correctly decided and the degree of involvement of Afzal Guru was not correctly assessed.\u201d \u201cIf someone holds that opinion, he doesn\u2019t become an anti-national. He\u2019s just holding a different opinion,\u201d he said.",
