Gopinathan\n\nEven if you do not sweat it out in the gym every morning, swapping out just a few minutes of sedentary time with some sort of movement can help you live longer, suggests a new research.\n\nIn the study involving over 3,000 people aged 50 to 79, researchers found that the least active people were five times more likely to die during the study period than the most active people, and three times more likely than those in the middle range for activity.\n\n\u201cYou did not have to even get a good sweat to experience the reduced likelihood of mortality,\u201d said study lead author Ezra Fishman from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cActivity doesn\u2019t have to be especially vigorous to be beneficial. That\u2019s the public health message,\u201d MR. Fishman noted.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise . For the study, the participants wore ultra-sensitive activity trackers \u2013 called accelerometers \u2013 for seven days, generating data compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For these same people, the agency then tracked mortality for the next eight years.\n\n\u201cWhen we compare people who exercise the same amount, those who sit less and move around more tend to live longer,\u201d Mr. Fishman said.\n\n\u201cThe folks who were walking around, washing the dishes, sweeping the floor tended to live longer than the people who were sitting at a desk,\u201d Mr. Fishman noted.\n\nThough the scientists did not discover any magic threshold for the amount a person needs to move to improve mortality, they did learn that even adding just 10 minutes per day of light activity could make a difference.\n\nReplacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity produced even better results. \u2014 IANS",
