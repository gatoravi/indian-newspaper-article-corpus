Vasanthakumar, a Chennai lawyer, despite a government order, dated December 3, 2014, rejecting his proposal for a National Court of Appeal with regional Benches.\n\nThe lawyer had approached the Union Ministry for Law and Justice with his proposal after the Supreme Court asked the government to hear him out through a judicial order on October 10, 2014.\n\nIn its order, the Ministry cited three grounds for rejecting the idea \u2014 The Supreme Court always sits in Delhi as per the Constitution; the Chief Justices of India in the past have \u201cconsistently opposed\u201d the idea of a National Court of Appeal or regional Benches to the Supreme Court; and the Attorney-General said a National Court of Appeal would \u201ccompletely change the constitution of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIn his petition , Mr. Vasanthakumar argues that he has been misunderstood and the government order is \u201cillegal.\u201d For one, he said, the request was not for regional Benches of the Supreme Court but for a separate judicial body: the National Court of Appeals.",
