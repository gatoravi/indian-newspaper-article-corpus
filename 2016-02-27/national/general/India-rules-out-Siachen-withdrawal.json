But we have to maintain this position. We have to man the strategic position. The position is very important from the strategic point,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said while replying to questions against the backdrop of the recent loss of 10 soldiers in an avalanche.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in this House can take Pakistan\u2019s words for granted...If we vacate the position, the enemy can occupy the position and they would have the strategic advantage. Then we would have to lose many more lives. We know the experience of 1984 [Siachen conflict],\u201d he said.\n\nIndia occupies the highest point in the Siachen glaciers, the Saltoro Ridge which is located at 23,000 feet, he said.\n\nOn February 3, an avalanche hit an Army post in a forward location in the Siachen glacier, burying 10 soldiers, including a JCO.\n\nOne of them was found alive under a huge mass of ice after six days but died a few days later.\n\nThe Minister said so far 915 people had lost their lives in the last 32 years in Siachen. \u2014 PTI",
