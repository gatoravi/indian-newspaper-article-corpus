Excavation works here yielded innumerable relics from across the seas.\n\nThe heritage footprints in the region, spread over 125 sq km, are so many that a discerning visitor may take at least a week to get a fair idea of the region\u2019s history and cultural diversity.\n\nMuziris, whose legacy goes back to 3,000 years ago, is said to have been the largest port of the ancient times in the East and traded in everything from precious stones to spices. It served as doorway for various cultures and races to India, says T.V. Anupama, Director of Kerala Tourism, whose department spearheaded the conservation efforts.\n\nMuziris is a port believed to\n\nhave fallen off\n\nthe map in the\n\n13th Century",
