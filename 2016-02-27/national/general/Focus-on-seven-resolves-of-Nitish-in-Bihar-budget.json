The BJP also termed the budget \u201ceyewash.\u201d\n\nPresenting the budget, Mr. Siddiqui said the focus has been put on the implementation of the \u201cseven resolves\u201d of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the holistic development of the State. Besides, emphasis has been given to education, energy and health sectors with maximum allocation.\n\nThe BJP slammed the budget saying there was nothing new it. \u201cThis budget has nothing to cheer about\u2026 it\u2019s just an eyewash to fool the people,\u201d said BJP leader Nand Kishore Yadav.\n\nAnother BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that the budgetary allocation to the education sector had, in fact, been slashed from the previous budget and still the government claimed it as a progressive one.\n\nThe BJP and its allies created a ruckus over the law and order situation in the State and the recent killings of some Opposition leaders, which led to the adjournment of the House in the first session. The ruling party leaders said \u201cjungle raj was prevailing under Central government in Delhi and not in Bihar.\u201d",
