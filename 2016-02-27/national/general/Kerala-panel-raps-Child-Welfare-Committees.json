    "text": "The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has asked the Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) in all districts to ensure that when children in need of care and protection are rescued and moved to safety, their parents should be informed of where they are being lodged.\n\nThe Commission has ordered the Director of the Social Justice Department to send written notes to 14 CWCs across the State, alerting them to uphold the right of the parents to know the whereabouts of their children even if they were incapable of protecting them.\n\nThe Commission issued the order in a full-bench sitting held on December 11, 2015, in connection with a complaint filed by a man from Veeramangalam near Cherpulassery in Palakkad district.\n\nHe had complained that the CWC, Malappuram, was not prepared to reveal where his four children were.\n\nThe police had rescued the children, two of them girls, from a house at Kadampuzha following a childline request in April 2013. The CWC sent them to an orphanage at Mukkam, but did not tell their father where they where. The father approached the Commission after he did not get any favourable reply from the CWC.\n\nThe Commission, in its order, found fault with the CWC for not responding to its queries about the whereabouts of the children.\n\n\u201cWe sent the children to a safe place as we found that the father was unable to give them protection ,\u201d said CWC Chairman Sharif Ullath.\n\nPanel says parents have the right to know the whereabouts of rescued kids",
