    "text": "Goddess Durga and the Mahishasura were liberally invoked during the debate in Parliament on the death of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula and the charges of sedition against students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) but not quite in the way that had been envisaged by the government.\n\nThe Congress took umbrage at the objectionable writings on the goddess in a pamphlet being read out by the Minister to serve as an example of \u201cdepravity\u201d in the mindset of those who organise Mahishasur festivals in universities.\n\nDeputy Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, who had protested against the matter on Thursday evening over the reading out of the pamphlets as well, raised objections on the issue again, saying, \u201cThe Minister must apologise for her remark about Goddess Durga.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople in the past have made blasphemous statements about gods, the Prophet and the Christ. But never before have these unsavoury remarks been repeated or quoted on the floor of the House,\u201d Mr. Sharma added.\n\nCPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said, \u201cThe quote was deliberate. The BJP used the entire debate to polarise. What was the need to bring in Goddess Durga? Ms. Irani has to apologise,\u201d he said. He also pointed out that in the broad traditions of Hinduism, Mahishasura was not considered a demon by many communities in India, even among Hindus. .\n\nReferring to Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha P.J. Kurien\u2019s Malayali origins, Mr. Yechury said Onam celebrated by Malayalis was to honour the legendary King Mahabali, who was supposed to be an Asura King, and was killed by the Vamana avatar of God Vishnu. \u201cWill they not be considered good Hindus?\u201d he said.",
