Anohni is nominated for \u2018Manta Ray\u2019, a collaboration with J. Ralph, for the documentary Racing Extinction .\n\n\u201cI am the only transgendered performer ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award, and for that I thank the artists who nominated me. I was in Asia when I found out the news,\u201d Anohni wrote in the essay.\n\n\u201cA week later, Sam Smith, Lady Gaga, and the Weeknd were rolled out as the evening\u2019s entertainment with more performers \u2018soon to be announced.\u2019 Confused, I sat and waited. Would someone be in touch? But as time bore on I heard nothing,\u201d the singer said. \u2014 IANS",
