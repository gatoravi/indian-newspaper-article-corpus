Very few crimes have been added to the initial list and declared punishable. Even now, here are offences in the code which were enacted by the British to meet their colonial needs. Yet, there are many new offences which have to be properly defined and incorporated in the code,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mukeherjee said the century \u201cwitnessed the proliferation of technology in wider spaces of human interaction and transaction. It has resulted in greater conveniences but, at the same time, has led to the occurrences of newer types of offences.\u201d\n\nChief Minister Oommen Chandy, Chief Justice of the High Court of Kerala Ashok Bhushan, Kerala Governor P. Satashivam, Advocate General K.P. Dandapani and K.V. Thomas, MP, were among those who attended.",
