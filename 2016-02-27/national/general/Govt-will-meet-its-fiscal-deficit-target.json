    "text": "The Economic Survey 2016-17, that was tabled in Parliament on Friday made several path-breaking recommendations including raising resources for recapitalising public sector banks by carefully leveraging the assets of the Reserve Bank of India and other regulatory institutions.\n\nThe survey unambiguously said the government would keep the fiscal deficit within the target of 3.9 per cent of GDP in the current year.\n\nThough it argued both in favour of why the government should stick to the fiscal consolidation targets as also the gains that could become possible through a higher-than-target deficit, the survey contains a strong hint that the target for the next year will be met: \u201cThe Government needs to be in a strong position tomorrow to repay the debts it is incurring today\u2026Credibility and optimality argue for adhering to 3.5 per cent of GDP fiscal deficit target\u201d.\n\nIt recommended a review of the medium term fiscal framework.",
