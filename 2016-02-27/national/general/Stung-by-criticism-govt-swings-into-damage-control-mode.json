They were also planning to send them another missive, asking why the police relied on video footage provided by a private news channel to register an FIR regarding the pro-Afzal Guru event organised there.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu earlier, though a police team was present when two groups of students were leading a march in JNU on February 9, an FIR of sedition was registered two days later when Zee News aired the show where some people allegedly raised anti-India slogans. As per the standard operating procedure (SOP), it is mandatory for the police to carry their own recording device whenever they have gone to attend a protest or gathering.\n\nWhen contacted, Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi confirmed that they had sent a report to the MHA. He told The Hindu , \u201cthe video recording was only incidental, we have other evidence to prove the case.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why wasn\u2019t the Delhi Police carrying their own camera and relied on the footage provided by Zee News, Mr. Bassi said, \u201cthe cameras Delhi Police have are amateurish. The video footage shot by you [news channels] people are done in a professional manner and they are of high quality. As I said earlier, video footage is only one of the evidence we have.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the Home Ministry said they would do a \u201ccourse-correction\u201d on the JNU matter and would try to fix responsibility for \u201cmishandling\u201d the entire situation. They added that the violence at Patiala House was completely avoidable and it unnecessarily embarrassed the government.\n\n\u201cThe Delhi Police are doing their investigation but we will be asking them some tough questions on the way they mishandled the entire episode. We have asked them for a report on the entire episode and will be seeking further clarifications on the conduct of the policemen on the court premises,\u201d said a senior Home Ministry official.\n\nMr. Bassi said they had sent a factual report to the MHA. He said, \u201cIt was a factual report and we have told the government that everything is fine at our end.\u201d\n\nHe said the forensic report of the Zee News footage had not arrived yet. The police had sent the video footage for examination amid allegations that a doctored version was aired.\n\nVishwa Deepak, a news producer associated with the channel, had resigned as a mark of protest against the \u201cbiased coverage\u201d of the incident.\n\nIn his resignation letter posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Deepak said, \u201cA video which did not even have the slogan of \u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 was still aired continuously. How did we blindly believe that these voices which came in the dark were of Kanhaiya or his friends? Instead of \u2018Bhartiya Court zindabad,\u2019 they heard Pakistan zindabad and spoilt some people\u2019s career, hopes and led their families to destruction.\u201d",
