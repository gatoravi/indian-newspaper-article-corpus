Soon after, the non-Jat communities united together under the banner of \u201c35 Biradari\u201d (35 castes). In Haryana, where 36 castes make its social mosaic, grouping of non-Jats against the Jats points to the clear division between Jats and other communities, which mainly comprise Sainis, Banias, Brahmins, Yadavs, Punjabis, and Nais.\n\nInter-community relations are severely strained and possibly might never be the same again even as many people across the State feel that political parties were only playing petty politics during the stir.\n\n\u201cWe were friends a few days ago, but now things have changed. They [Jat protesters] burned our houses, shops,\u201d a dejected Hari Kesh, whose sweet shop was set ablaze in Kaithal told The Hindu , adding that he would never forgive the people who looted and torched his shop.\n\nShouting a slogan \u201c35 biradari zindabad\u201d, Mr. Kesh said it was on the intervening night of February 21 that a mob of around 20,000 protesters struck his shop, set it ablaze and looted all cash. \u201cThey were targeting us [non-Jats]. Even the police didn\u2019t come to our help\u201d he alleged.\n\nIn Haryana, Jats account for around 29 per cent of the population and are politically influential but until now, caste differences never led to such acute conflict.\n\nA Municipal Council ward member of Kaithal, Prem Chand, said as protesters went on a destruction spree, the Jat-dominated police were mute spectators.",
