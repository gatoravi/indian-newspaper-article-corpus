    "text": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday announced the takeover of Dunlop and Jessop \u2014 two private sector ailing industrial units run by the Pawan Ruia Group.\n\nParticipating in the debate on Governor K.N. Tripathi\u2019s address in the West Bengal Assembly, Ms. Banerjee said a legislation would be brought for the purpose.\n\nThe Chief Minister referred to the Centre\u2019s proposed takeover of the ailing tea gardens of Duncans Group in north Bengal, and said the State will acquire these units in a similar manner.\n\nThe two units are now officially open, but without any production. Mr. Ruia had acquired DIL in 2005 and Jessop (an engineering PSU) in 2003. Over 650 people are on DIL\u2019s rolls at the mother unit in Sahagunj in Hooghly district.\n\nThe move caught the company top brass by surprise. Their official reaction was that they are now watching the development.\n\nState\u2019s Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee told journalists that a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the State Assembly would be convened on Saturday morning where the proposal to bring legislation for the takeover of the industries would be brought.\n\nEven as he said that the Opposition supports such measures, Leader of the Opposition in State Assembly Surjya Kanta Mishra said the Left Parties will decide on their stand later, if they find the government forcing the passage of the legislation.",
