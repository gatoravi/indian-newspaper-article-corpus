    "text": "Pakistan has planned to buy eight F-16s, radars and other equipment, worth $699 million, from the U.S.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain has sought a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the proposed sale of U.S built F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan. Mr. McCain, who is also the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was concerned about the consequences the sale would have for U.S relations with India.\n\n\u201cI would rather have seen it kicked over into the next administration,\u201d Mr. McCain said. Lockheed Martin Corp, the company that makes F-16s, is lobbying with the Congress members for not impeding the sale.\n\nIn a deal worth $ 699 million that the Obama administration notified the Congress on February 12, Pakistan was to buy eight F-16s, radars and other equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Senator Rand Paul has moved a resolution that seeks to stop the sale altogether.\n\nAs per the U.S laws, the Congress can vote to stop or modify the terms of a foreign military sale, but that will be subject to a presidential veto.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker had said he would not try to block the deal itself, but would oppose the financing of the deal from the U.S foreign military financing. Pakistan was to pay only $ 200 million.",
