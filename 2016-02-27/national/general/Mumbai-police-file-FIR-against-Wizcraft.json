The report, which was prepared by fire brigade officials, said that the fire, which is believed to have been triggered by a short circuit, was aggravated by the presence of prohibited combustible materials placed under the stage, pointing to negligence on part of the organisers.\n\nThe police have, for the moment, not named any specific person in the FIR, which is registered against \u2018officials concerned\u2019 of Wizcraft.\n\n\u201cInquiries are under way with officials and employees of Wizcraft who were responsible for organising the event, as well as the people who were present at the venue on the night of the incident. After completing inquiries with them, and after conducting corroborative inquiries and getting reports from the Forensic Sciences Laboratory, we will be able to pinpoint exact responsibility and take action accordingly,\u201d Mr. Kulkarni said.",
