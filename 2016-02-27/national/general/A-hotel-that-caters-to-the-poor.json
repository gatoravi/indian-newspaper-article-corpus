    "text": "At a time when the prices of foodgrain are becoming increasingly unaffordable, a hotel in Nizamabad of Telangana supplies breakfast, lunch and dinner at Rs. 20.\n\nVanam Kiran Kumar, who has been successfully running the Indur Janata Bhojanalayam at Subash Nagar here, had been thinking for a long time to provide affordable food to the poor and those who cannot afford to spend much on it.\n\nThough there were few takers when the food centre opened in December last year, it slowly picked up. Now about 400 to 500 people, including students, employees, small-time businessmen and petty vendors, have food here every day. The unique feature here is that the food \u2013 jowar (sorghum) roti, rice and curries \u2013 are prepared on firewood oven and supplied in leafy plates. Water is supplied in small earthen pots and tumblers.\n\n\u201cInfluenced by the management principle \u201cjugaad\u201d (creativity to make existing things work or create new things with meagre resources), I wanted to launch this service. I have seen several poor persons go without food. I don\u2019t want to make money from it but to feed the poor,\u201d says Mr. Kiran, who also runs Human Resource Development Centre, a social service organisation providing training to women and youth to find employment.",
