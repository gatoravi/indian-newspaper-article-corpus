An official of the Exim Bank working on credit lines to Mongolia, said that the bank expected most of the $1 billion credit line to be dedicated to infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Hindu has learnt that the credit line is part of a strategy to emerge as the \u201cthird pole\u201d in Mongolia\u2019s international relations which so far have been dominated by China and Russia.",
