This year, for the fourth week now, we are keeping a constant eye on separatists,\u201d he said.\n\nPro-Guru protests were held in several parts on Friday. Activists of Syed Ali Geelani\u2019s Tehreek-e-Hurriyat and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq\u2019s All Parties Hurriyat Conference hit the streets in several areas of Srinagar and Budgam.\n\nBesides banners with Guru\u2019s photograph, protesters were seen carrying posters of incarcerated JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, JNU scholar Umar Khalid and rights activist S.A.R. Geelani, demanding their \u201cunconditional release\u201d.\n\nSeparatist Zamrooda Habib, chairperson of Muslim Khawateen Markaz, said, \u201cNew Delhi is intimidating Kashmiris in one or the other way. We are not going to tolerate this. Delhi should realize ground realities in Kashmir\u2026 Slapping sedition charges against Prof. Geelani, Kanhaiya Kumar and other students has no moral justification. If they are not released soon, whole Kashmir will come on streets and will start protests,\u201d she warned. Several protests in Srinagar saw a repetition of slogans raised in JNU on February 9, including \u2018BJP sun ley Azadi\u2019. Pro-Guru graffiti and his picture in a kafiya (Arabic head scarf) have appeared on several walls across the old city uptown areas. Several videos, praising Guru in songs in Kashmiri, have surfaced online.\n\nSpeaking after the Friday prayers in the old city, the Mirwaiz said, \u201cWe hope educated youth of India now understand that Kashmiris were being victimised by the Government of India and its policies. When things are pointed out by persons like Gautam Navlakha, Arundhati Roy or Prashant Bhushan, they are not only harassed but also targeted with violence.\u201d\n\nThe Mirwaiz alleged the youth were being pushed to the wall and \u201ctheir voice stifled by unleashing reign of terror\u201d. \u201cThe law of nature is that the more the government tries to crush the voice, the more vociferously these voices reverberate,\u201d he said.",
