I want that alliance to be made official,\u201d she said in the Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe have forged a people\u2019s alliance, and the people will give their verdict and we will come back [to power],\u201d she said.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Surjya Kanta Mishra pointed out that Ms. Banerjee had forged an alliance with the Congress and the BJP time and again.\n\n\u201cWho is criticising whom. How many times she has forged an alliance [with the Congress and the BJP]. People of the State know this,\u201d he told journalists\n\nMs. Banerjee told the Assembly that farmers of Singur, who were unwilling to part with their land for the Tata Motors small car project, had not got their land back.
