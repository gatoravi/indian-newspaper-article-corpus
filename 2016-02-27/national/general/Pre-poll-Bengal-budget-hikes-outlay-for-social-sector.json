    "text": "16.9 per cent increase in the State plan outlay\n\nWest Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra on Friday announced major hikes in outlays for select sectors in the interim budget. The poll-bound State will thus see considerable increase in the plan outlays of the departments of minority affairs and madrasa education, backward class and tribal development, self-help group and self employment, public health engineering and public works, panchayat & rural development and health & family department.\n\nMr. Mitra\u2019s limited deficit budget proposed a 16.9 per cent increase in the State plan outlay, taking it to Rs. 57,905 crore . No additional resource mobilisation was proposed.\n\nIn his overview of the State finance, the Minister said despite the debt stress inherited (around Rs.2 lakh crore), it managed its affairs through improved recovery and own tax collection . The revised estimate of gross fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross state domestic product (a key indicator of fiscal discipline) stood at 2.18 per cent which was higher than the budget estimate but lower than 2014-15. West Bengal\u2019s outstanding market borrowings are estimated at Rs. 16,30,838.9 crore.\n\nReacting to the references in the budget, Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Surjya Kanta Mishra told journalists that the Trinamool Congress government had set a precedent that so much untruth could be printed in form of a document. He said that the higher percentage of growth had been recorded as the Union government had changed its methodology of measuring growth in different sectors.\n\nMr. Mishra also criticised the Trinamool government for reflecting the Central allocation to key schemes implemented by the State government in the budget.",
