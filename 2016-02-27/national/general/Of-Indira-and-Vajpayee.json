    "text": "In his attack on the government over invoking Goddess Durga and Mahishasura in the ongoing debate in Parliament, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Friday made an interesting intervention.\n\n\u201cAfter the war of liberation of Bangladesh, the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee invoked Goddess Durga to describe the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in this very House. In response, Indira Gandhi had refused to accept the title saying that in India there are many who worship Mahishasura and it would not be proper for her to accept the encomium,\u201d Mr. Yechury said.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley disputed that Mr. Vajpayee had ever done so and demanded to see records that authenticated the statement.\n\nThe BJP has always maintained that Mr. Vajpayee had never made the comparison.",
