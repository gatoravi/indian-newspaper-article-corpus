    "text": "In the latest twist to the controversy over Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s expensive watch, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Friday claimed that a person told him over phone that it resembled a custom-made watch that was stolen from the Bengaluru residence of the caller\u2019s Kuwait-returned friend.\n\nMr. Kumaraswamy demanded that an investigation, preferably by the Central Bureau of Investigation, be conducted to know the truth.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Mr. Kumaraswamy claimed the caller told him that his friend, Sudhakhar Shetty, had filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police on May 7 last year stating that four expensive watches had been stolen from his house. Mr. Kumaraswamy also claimed that Dr. Shetty, who initially wanted to meet him, had changed his mind.\n\n\u2018Not the same one\u2019\n\nHowever, Dr. Shetty told a private TV channel and the police that the watch in possession of the Chief Minister was not the one that was stolen from his house. He denied Mr. Kumaraswamy\u2019s allegations that he was under pressure to suppress facts.\n\nA senior officer at Cubbon Park police station, who is investigating the case, confirmed that the make and brand of the stolen watch was different from the one in the possession of Mr. Siddaramaiah. Dr. Shetty\u2019s driver, who was questioned by the police, also said it was not the same watch.",
