    "text": "A Delhi-based lawyer, who has filed a criminal complaint against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for his reported remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, said in the court of a Metropolitan Magistrate here on Friday that the statements could spread disharmony in the country.\n\nComplainant Pradeep Dwivedi contended before Magistrate Abhilash Malhotra that the use of words such as \u201ccoward\u201d and \u201cpsychopath\u201d should invite prosecution under Sections 124-A (sedition) and 500 (defamation) of Indian Penal Code.\n\nThese remarks would spread hatred and contempt against the Prime Minister, said Mr. Dwivedi. He said Mr. Kejriwal had made the remarks because of political rivalry with Mr. Modi existing since elections.\n\nThe court adjourned the case to May 28 after asking the complainant to place on record the judgments in support of his case.",
