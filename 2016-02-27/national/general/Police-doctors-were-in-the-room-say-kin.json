    "text": "The family and friends of Rohith Vemula rebutted HRD Minister Smriti Irani\u2019s claims point by point. \u201cI had arrived at the suicide spot soon after Rohith\u2019s death came to light. The police and doctors were very much in the room where the body was lying,\u201d said Rohith\u2019s brother Raja, who criticised Ms. Irani for making \u201cfalse\u201d claims about the death. The Minister had said in Parliament that no attempt was made to revive Rohith, no doctor was allowed near his body, and his body was instead used as a political tool. On Thursday, the duty doctor at the university contradicted the claim that no doctor was allowed near the body to revive Rohith.\n\nRohith\u2019s friend Dontha Prasanth criticised Ms. Irani for concealing from the country the letter that had hinted at a possible suicide.\n\nOn December 18, Rohith had purportedly written to the Vice-Chancellor, expressing anguish at the \u201cpersonal interest\u201d shown by him [the V-C] in the \u201csocial boycott\u201d of Dalit research scholars.\n\n\u201cIn the letter, Rohith asked the V-C to provide all Dalit students with 10 milligrams of sodium azide and a rope at the time of admission. Why Ms. Irani did not mention this letter in Parliament,\u201d Prasanth asked.",
