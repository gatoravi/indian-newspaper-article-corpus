    "text": "The BJP faced embarrassment on Friday after its MP Udit Raj admitted that he too had attended the Mahishasura meet at the JNU in 2013 after HRD Minister Smriti Irani had gone hammer and tongs against the organisers of the event, quoting from their pamphlets.\n\nMr. Raj, however, sought to wriggle out of the situation saying he was not in the BJP at that time.\n\n\u201cI follow the ideology of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, how can I go against him? Babasaheb was a nationalist, I am a nationalist too. I attended Mahishasura festival in 2013, I was not in the BJP then,\u201d he said. \u201cI was an activist that time but I changed. Only fools and dead men don't change their views.\u201d",
