Chelameswar and A.M. Sapre initially told advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal, that the petition was a mere add-on to an earlier one filed by JNU alumnus N.D. Jayaprakash over the February 15 violence.\n\nMr. Jayaprakash\u2019s petition will be heard on March 10.\n\n\u201cWhat is the harm in hearing this petition, too? The earlier petition [Mr. Jayaprakash\u2019s] was filed on February 16 and is only concerned with the February 15 violence at the Patiala House court. This one is comprehensive. Violence happened on February 17 despite your orders. That is gross contempt. There is an NHRC report. Please take up this matter,\u201d Mr. Bhushan said.\n\nJustice Chelameswar replied: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what the harm is... The simple harm is it will add to the docket of the Supreme Court.\u201d The court then went on to issue notice.\n\nMs. Jaiswal has also sought a Special Investigation Team to be set up by the Supreme Court to probe the violence.\n\nObjections were raised in the courtroom by several lawyers against Mr. Bhushan appearing in the contempt petition. They said he himself was facing contempt for comments allegedly made against the former judges of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut the Bench asked them to formally apply if they wanted to intervene.\n\nMr. Bhushan said the violence caused \u201cinternational alarm\u201d even as the Delhi Police Commissioner described it as a \u201cminor scuffle.\u201d\n\nThe petition by Ms. Jaiswal has arraigned the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Delhi Police and the three lawyers \u2014 Vikram Singh Chauhan, Yashpal Singh and Om Sharma \u2014 as parties.\n\nThe Supreme Court has served notice on the lawyers through the Bar Council of India.",
