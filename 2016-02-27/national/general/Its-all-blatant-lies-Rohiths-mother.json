    "text": "Radhika Vemula, mother of Hyderabad University research scholar Rohith Vemula, on Friday sharpened her attack on Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya and others for branding her son an anti-national and extremist.\n\nAt a press conference at the Indian Women\u2019s Press Corps here, Ms. Vemula asked Ms. Irani to shed her soap opera persona and accused her of blatantly lying in Parliament on Wednesday about the circumstances surrounding the death of her son. She warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the BJP would be \u201cdecimated\u201d if he did not act against Ms. Irani, Mr. Dattatreya and others \u201cresponsible\u201d for the death.\n\nRohith\u2019s friend Dontha Prasanth said Ms. Irani had used \u201ccinematic expressions\u201d to spread falsehoods about the suicide and the events preceding it. Rohith\u2019s friends and family rebutted Ms. Irani\u2019s claims point by point. \u201cI had arrived at the suicide spot soon after Rohith\u2019s death came to light. The police and doctors were very much in the room where the body was lying,\u201d said Rohith\u2019s brother Raja Chaitanya. The Minister had said in Parliament that no attempt was made to revive Rohith and no doctor was allowed near the body, which was instead used as a political tool. The duty doctor at the university on Thursday contradicted the claim that no doctor was allowed near the body to revive Rohith. Mr. Prasanth criticised Ms. Irani for concealing from the country the letter that had hinted at a possible suicide.\n\nOn December 18, Rohith had reportedly written to the Vice-Chancellor, expressing his anguish at the \u201cpersonal interest\u201d shown by him [the V-C] in the \u201csocial boycott\u201d of Dalit research scholars. \u201cIn the letter, Rohith asked the Vice-Chancellor to provide all Dalit students with 10 milligrams of sodium azide and a rope at the time of admission. Why did not Ms. Irani mention this letter in Parliament,\u201d Prasanth asked. Ms. Vemula urged Mr. Modi to act as the \u201cnation\u2019s Prime Minister\u201d and not just of \u201cthe BJP and his own caste.\u201d",
