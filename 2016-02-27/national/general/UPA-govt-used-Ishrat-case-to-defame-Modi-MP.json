    "text": "The remarks of former Home Minister P. Chidambaram on Afzal Guru and former Home Secretary G.K. Pillai on Ishrat Jahan found their echo in the Lok Sabha on Friday with a BJP member claiming that the former UPA government had tried to settle scores with its political rival, Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n\nBJP member Anurag Thakur referred to reports quoting Mr. Chidambaram as saying that Afzal Guru\u2019s \u201ccase was perhaps not correctly decided\u201d and Mr. Pillai as saying that the affidavit submitted to the Gujarat High Court in 2009 about the LeT links of Ishrat Jahan and her accomplices, who were killed in an alleged fake encounter in 2004, was changed at the \u201cpolitical level\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was an attempt to fix Modi... it was a conspiracy to put in dock political rivals by the previous (UPA) government,\u201d Mr. Thakur said.\n\n\u201cWho changed the affidavit [in the Ishrat Jahan case], the nation wants to know,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the District Judge of Ahmedabad, who investigated the encounter, had found it to be fake.\n\n\u201cThe government of Gujarat went in appeal against the judgment. In a court-monitored CBI investigation, the same findings were upheld. Once those findings are upheld not by one, but two judicial authorities, then we would only refer to those and not enter into any speculation based on the individual wisdom of a particular person,\u201d Mr. Surjewala said.",
