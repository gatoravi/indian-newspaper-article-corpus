Mustafah\n\nSome held their tears, while others were inconsolable as coffins of security personnel killed in the Pathankot terror strike reached home for the last rites, which were performed with full military honours.\n\nAmid the pall of gloom that descended on the remote village of Elambulassery, near Mannarkkad, in Palakkad, hundreds bade a tearful adieu to Lt. Col. E.K. Niranjan.\n\nA long way from there, at Garnala, near Ambala, in Haryana, slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai rent the air as the body of Garud commando Gursewak Singh, draped in the Tricolour, reached the village.\n\nThe family members of the young soldier, who was married in November, were inconsolable.\n\nIn Gurdaspur, Punjab, scores of mourners gathered at the house of Subedar Fateh Singh, 51, a shooter who had won Commonwealth medals. Singh\u2019s daughter Madhu joined the soldiers in carrying the body for cremation.\n\nBack in Elambulassery, the gloom was mixed with a spirit of pride and defiance as mourners converged near his ancestral house, where the mortal remains were laid to rest with full official and military honours on Tuesday noon.\n\nNiranjan, a National Security Guards commando, made the supreme sacrifice while defusing a grenade from a terrorist\u2019s body at the Indian Air Force base at Pathankot on Sunday.\n\nThe cremation was held around half past noon. Chief Minister Oommen Chandyvisited the ancestral house earlier to pay the last respects.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",
