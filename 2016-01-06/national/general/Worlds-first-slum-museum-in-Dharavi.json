    "text": "Dharavi in Mumbai is to get the world\u2019s first slum museum, organisers said on Tuesday. The museum will showcase some of the myriad objects that are produced every year in Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums and the setting for Danny Boyle's hit 2008 movie Slumdog Millionaire .\n\n\u201cIt will be the first museum ever created in a slum,\u201d said Spanish artist Jorge Rubio, who is behind the initiative.\n\nThe small mobile museum will open in February for two months and display everything from pottery and textiles to recycled items, Mr. Rubio added.\n\nThe organisers of Design Museum Dharavi say they want to challenge people\u2019s perceptions of slums by highlighting the creative talent that resides in them. More than a million people live in the maze of alleyways that make up Dharavi with many working in the area\u2019s mini-factories, which produce every kind of product imaginable.\n\nFollowing the success of Slumdog Millionaire , the slum has become a tourist attraction and guides offer tours of its hundreds of workshops.\n\nIn 2010, Britain\u2019s Prince Charles cited Dharavi as a role model for sustainable living, praising its habit of recycling waste. Last year the slum hosted its first art biennale. More than half of Mumbai\u2019s 20 million inhabitants live in slums, enduring cramped conditions. \u2014 AFP\n\nThe organisers of Design Museum Dharavi say they want to challenge people\u2019s perceptions of slums by highlighting the creative talent that resides in them",
