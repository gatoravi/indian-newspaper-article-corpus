Cultural programmes and a laser show are on the list. Hundreds of artists from Rayalaseema and Karnataka will take part in the three-day festival, for which an initial budget of Rs. 10 lakh has been sanctioned.\n\nThe fort is under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\n\nThe main fort, called the Raja Mahal, now hosts a museum with antique sculptures, swords and utensils belonging to the Vijayanagara empire. The Rani Mahal, a few metres away, is considered a favourite for the youth. The small tank (koneru) on the fort premises, with a hill wall serving as a natural embankment, offers boat rides for tourists. The highlight of the fort is the Sound and Light show in English and Telugu. On an average, 60 tourists attend the show daily, while steps are mooted to increase the number to its full capacity of 250.\n\nThe district administration sought the permission of the Director-General, ASI, for setting up new facilities on the fort premises. The proposed plan included setting up of Darbar Hall, removable structures to serve as shelter to tourists, trek atop a hill adjoining the fort, snacks bar atop the hill. The tourism officials said permission was also sought for laying a direct road link to the fort from Tirupati-Bengaluru national highway.",
