Dhar\u2019s mother and sister have also watched the video, released by the IS on Sunday, and noticed similarities between the voice of the masked terrorist, being referred to as the \u201cnew Jihadi John\u201d by the British media.\n\n\u201cI heard the voice, yes, but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure of the voice. These are the most difficult questions to answer. I just cannot say. I\u2019m not sure within myself whether it is the truth or not,\u201d his mother Sobita Dhar said.\n\nHis sister, Konika Dhar, from north London, said: \u201cI believed the audio to resemble, from what I remember, the voice of my brother, but having viewed the short clip in detail, I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced, which put me at ease.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This is just so shocking for me. I don\u2019t know what the authorities are doing to confirm the identity, but I need to know if it is.\u201d\n\nShe said her brother had converted to Islam more than 10 years ago and her memories of him are from when they were children and teenagers.\n\n\u201cHe was a very pleasant boy, and I know it may be hard to believe, but he still is, and I still believe that he still can be that person,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018It is Dhar's voice\u2019\n\nOne of Dhar\u2019s former business associates told the BBC he had \u201cno doubt\u201d the voice on the video was that of Dhar, who had been arrested by the British police on the suspicion of encouraging terrorism but was later able to travel to Syria after being bailed.\n\nHis former neighbours from Walthamstow in east London claimed Dhar\u2019s wife was more devout than him and suggested she may have put him on the path to extremism.\n\nIn the months leading up to his arrest, Dhar was accused of calling for the imposition of Sharia law in Britain. \u2014 PTI\n\nBorn a Hindu, he converted to Islam and joined the radical group\n\nAl Muhajiroun",
