I discharged my functions lawfully and with utmost integrity. I have not received directly or indirectly a single rupee from the DDCA on any account whatsoever. I have not even charged any amount towards expenditure,\u201d Mr. Jaitley said in his evidence.\n\nThe Minister further said that the statements [by Mr. Kejriwal and the other AAP leaders] were aimed at deflecting attention from a CBI investigation against a public servant who was working with accused no. 1 [Mr. Kejriwal] in relation to a complaint filed by a third party.\n\nTalking to reporters on December 15, Mr. Kejriwal had said: \u201cThe CBI raided my office to locate files related to corruption in the DDCA. Which file? DDCA files in which Arun Jaitley is in the dock. I was about to order a commission of enquiry\u2026\u201d\n\nQuoting these remarks in his complaint, Mr. Jaitley termed them baseless and defamatory.\n\nReferring to the construction and renovation of the cricket stadium at Ferozeshah Kotla when he was the DDCA president, Mr. Jaitley said the executive committee or the board of directors of the company had authorised a committee to supervise it, of which he was not a member.\n\nHowever, in his capacity as the president, he used to chair the board meetings where only important decisions were put up for approval before the board or the executive committee, the Finance Minister said.\n\nRajat Sharma examined\n\nThe court also examined Rajat Sharma, chairman and editor-in-chief of India TV, as a witness in support of Mr. Jaitley.\n\nJaitley deposes in Delhi court in defamation case against Arvind Kejriwal",
