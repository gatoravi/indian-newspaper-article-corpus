They may begin a mass movement for this in 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kumar cited the example of Hasan Khan Mewati, who, he said, fought against Mughal king Babur alongside Rajput king Rana Sanga, saying he was the role model Indian Muslims wanted to follow.\n\nSaffron groups have been gradually raising the pitch for a Ram temple. Parties such as the BSP and the Congress see this as a bid to polarise Uttar Pradesh that goes to the polls in 2017, though the Ayodhya title suit is pending before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u2018No possibility of mosque\u2019\n\nMohammad Afzal, who heads the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said his organisation wanted to provide a platform to Hindus and Muslims to amicably settle the dispute.\n\nHowever, Mr. Afzal has a definition of \u2018settlement\u2019 that eliminates the possibility of a mosque at the site. \u201cNo Muslim organisation has been able to prove ownership rights over the land at Ayodhya. There can either be a Ram temple or status quo,\u201d Mr. Afzal said.\n\n\u201c",
