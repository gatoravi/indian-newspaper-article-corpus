The 89-year-old is now confined to a nursing home, her sight and hearing deeply affected by a stroke, and has given no public interviews for years.\n\nLee wrote the manuscript in the late 1950s, but her then-editor suggested she recast the book from the childhood perspective of Scout, which became Mockingbird .\n\nWhile some reviews have been charitable about its merit in plotting her development as a writer, others have been scathing about the unedited draft, set in the era of the civil rights movement.\n\nSecond and third bestsellers were the latest instalments in Jeff Kinney\u2019s Diary of Wimpy Kid series and British author EL James\u2019 mommy-porn erotica Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian . Each sold 1.48 million and 1.4 million copies respectively in the United States, according to data compiled by Nielsen. In fourth place was nail-biting thriller The Girl on the Train written by Paula Hawkins, a former journalist based in London.\n\nThe same book topped the list of top 10 Kindle bestsellers on Amazon in 2015, on which Go Set a Watchman came sixth. \u2014 AFP\n\n\u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d\n\nfeatures many of the characters of Lee's 1960 masterpiece",
