    "text": "Will Kalyan Singh, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and poster boy of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, play a central role in next year\u2019s Assembly polls? Will he step down as the Governor of Rajasthan and return to U.P. as the BJP\u2019s face of the backward community?\n\nThese were some of the questions that kept guests occupied at his 84th birthday celebrations here on Tuesday.\n\nTraditionally, his birthdays have been celebrated in a grand fashion. A political hue was evident this time with the flow of BJP leaders at his official residence in Lucknow. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh wished him on telephone and Twitter, over a dozen BJP MPs, including hardliners Sakshi Maharaj and Vinay Katiyar, rushed to the Mall Avenue lawns, bustling with ticket-seekers and party office-bearers.\n\nAge a hurdle\n\nThe BJP leaders admit that owing to his age, Mr. Singh cannot be portrayed as a direct face of the party\u2019s campaign, but feel his background would help in mobilising non-Yadav OBC votes. In addition to being associated with the Hindutva movement, Mr. Singh\u2019s credentials as a backward caste leader of the Lodh community and his two-term tenure as CM, are being viewed as his plus points.\n\nThe speculation over a possible role for Mr. Singh got credence owing to his extended five-day stay in Lucknow, where he said he was ready for any role given to him.",
