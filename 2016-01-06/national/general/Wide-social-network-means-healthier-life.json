Specifically, the team found that the sheer size of a person\u2019s social network was important for health in early and late adulthood.\n\nIn adolescence, that is, social isolation increased risk of inflammation by the same amount as physical inactivity while social integration protected against abdominal obesity. In old age, social isolation was actually more harmful to health than diabetes on developing and controlling hypertension.\n\nIn middle adulthood, it was not the number of social connections that mattered, but what those connections provided in terms of social support or strain, the study said.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between health and the degree to which people are integrated in large social networks is strongest at the beginning and at the end of life, and not so important in middle adulthood, when the quality, not the quantity, of social relationships matters,\u201d Prof. Harris said.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . \u2014 IANS\n\nSocial isolation increased risk of inflammation by the same amount as physical inactivity",
