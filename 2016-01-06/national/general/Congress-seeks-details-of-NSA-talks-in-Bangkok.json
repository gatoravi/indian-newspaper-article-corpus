    "text": "The Congress on Tuesday stepped up its criticism of the BJP government over its handling of the Pathankot terror attack, seeking details about National Security Adviser Ajit Doval\u2019s meeting with his Pakistan counterpart, Nasir Khan, in Bangkok in early December.\n\n\u201cAfter the cancellation of NSA-level talks in August, what was the understanding reached between Doval and his Pakistan counterpart in Bangkok,\u201d asked senior Congress leader Anand Sharma. A former Minister of State of External Affairs in UPA-I, Mr. Sharma said only the disclosure of the outcome of the government\u2019s engagement with Pakistan in Bangkok would help the Opposition understand what prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a surprise trip to Lahore.\n\n\u201cWhat assurances were given [by the Pakistani NSA] to merit this dramatic gesture,\u201d asked Mr.Sharma.\n\nHe said the Congress was keen on knowing if Mr. Modi believed that the \u201cPakistani establishment, including their Army and the ISI, are for the dialogue process. What assured the Prime Minister that the resumption of the peace process had the full support and endorsement of the entire Pakistani establishment,\u201d the Congress leader said.\n\nTerming Mr. Modi\u2019s Lahore visit a \u201cdramatic gesture\u201d, Mr. Sharma said the UPA government preferred \u201coutcomes over optics\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow, this has been reversed by optics coming first. Optics have taken place in Lahore,\u201d Mr. Sharma said.",
