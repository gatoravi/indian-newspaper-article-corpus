Until now, though, almost nothing was known about the giant\u2019s anatomical shape or habits.\n\nFossil records\n\nThe only fossil records are four partial lower jaws, and perhaps a thousand teeth \u2014 the first of which turned up in the 1930s in Hong Kong apothecaries where they were sold as \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth.\u201d\n\nThese meagre remains \u201care clearly insufficient to say if the animal was bipedal or quadrupedal, and what would be its body proportions,\u201d Herve Bocherens, a researcher at Tubingen University in Germany, said.\n\nIts closest modern cousin is the orangutan, but whether Gigantopithecus had the same golden-red hue, or was black like a gorilla is unknown.\n\nAnother mystery: its diet. Was it a meat-eater or a vegetarian? Did it share a taste for bamboo with its neighbour the prehistoric giant panda?\n\nAnswering this riddle might also tell us why a monster that surely had little to fear from other fauna went extinct. That\u2019s where the teeth had a story to tell.\n\nExamining slight variations in carbon isotopes found in tooth enamel, Mr. Bocherens and an international team of scientists showed that the primordial King Kong lived only in the forest, was a strict vegetarian, and probably wasn\u2019t crazy about bamboo.\n\nThese narrow preferences did not pose a problem for Gigantopithecus until Earth was struck by a massive ice age during the Pleistocene Epoch, which stretched from about 2.6 million to 12,000 years ago.\n\nThat\u2019s when Nature, evolution \u2014 and perhaps a refusal to try new foods \u2014 conspired to doom the giant ape, Mr. Bocherens explained.\n\n\u201cDue to its size, Gigantopithecus presumably depended on a large amount of food,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen during the Pleistocene, more and more forested area turned into savannah landscapes, there was simply an insufficient food supply,\u201d he added.\n\nSome apes survived\n\nAnd yet, according to the study, other apes and early humans in Africa that had comparable dental gear were able to survive similar transitions by eating the leaves, grass and roots offered by their new environments.\n\nBut for some reason, Asia\u2019s giant ape \u2014 which was probably too heavy to climb trees, or swing in their branches \u2014 did not make the switch.\n\n\u201c Gigantopithecus probably did not have the same ecological flexibility and possibly lacked the physiological ability to resist stress and food shortage,\u201d notes the study, which is to be published in a specialist journal, Quaternary International . \u2014 AFP",
