    "text": "Dealing with bounced cheques will no longer be tedious, with the government notifying changes to the negotiable instruments law on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the main amendments cleared by Parliament in the winter session deals with where a cheque-bounce case can be filed.\n\nWhile the original Act stipulated that the case be filed only where the cheque was issued, the amendment says it can be filed only where it was deposited. This should help expedite resolution of cheque-bounce cases since the aggrieved party need not travel to the issuer\u2019s location to file a case. Estimates peg the number of cheque-bounce cases in India at 18 lakh, 38,000 of which are pending in the High Courts.\n\nThe provisions of the amended Act are to come into force with retrospective effect from June 15, 2015, the Ministry of Finance said in a notification.",
