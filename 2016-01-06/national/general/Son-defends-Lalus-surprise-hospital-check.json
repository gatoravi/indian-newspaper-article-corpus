    "text": "Two days after Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad made a surprise inspection of a hospital, provoking the BJP to question his locus standi for such a move, Bihar Health Minister and Mr. Prasad\u2019s elder son, Tej Pratap, on Tuesday spoke out in his defence.\n\n\u201c My father went to the hospital and observed many discrepancies there. He has issued directives (to take steps to improve the conditions) to us and we\u2019ll abide by them after discussions with the officials.\u201d Mr. Tej Pratap told mediapersons here.\n\nHe said people had given leaders the mandate to work and \u201cwe\u2019re working for them\u201d. Mr. Prasad made the surprise visit to the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) hospital, where he received feedback from patients regarding the facilities. He also met the doctors on duty. Mr. Prasad later told mediapersons that he had gone to meet a patient admitted to a private hospital in Raza Bazaar area and only visited the IGIMS to assess its condition. He then apparently advised Mr. Tej Pratap to inspect government hospitals at regular intervals.\n\nFollowing this, 40 nurses on contract services in the Patna Medical College and Hospitals (PMCH) came to meet Mr. Prasad on Monday, demanding regularisation of their jobs. However, Mr. Prasad reportedly refused to meet them.\n\nThe Opposition BJP, however, seized the occasion to question Mr. Prasad\u2019s credentials. \u201cIn what capacity did Lalu Prasad go to inspect the government-run hospital and give directions to officials and doctors?\u201d asked senior state BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.\n\n\u2018Two power centres\u2019\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it proof enough that Bihar has two power centres? Nitish Kumar is the Chief Minister while Lalu Prasad is running the government,\u201d he added.\n\nReacting to Mr. Tej Pratap\u2019s defence, BJP MLA Nitin Navin asked, \u201cFor how long will Tej Pratap be his father\u2019s pampered child? A father can give directions to his son in his home, not in hospitals in his son\u2019s official capacity.\u201d",
