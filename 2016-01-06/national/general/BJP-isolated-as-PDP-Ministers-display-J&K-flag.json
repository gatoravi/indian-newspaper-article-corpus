PDP Ministers have been exhibiting the State flag at official meetings. State Public Works Minister Altaf Bukhari and Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution (CAPD) Minister Zulfikar Chaudhary were seen presiding over official meetings with both the flags in front of them since last week.\n\nState\u2019s Advocate-General Jehangir Iqbal Ganie\u2019s clarification has been a setback to the BJP.\n\n\u201cThe double Bench has only stayed the single Bench judgment. Whether there is a circular or not, whether there is a judgment or not, the State flag remains there. The State flag has its own status, unmindful of a judgment or a circular,\u201d said Mr. Ganie.\n\nBJP leader Farooq Khan and senior advocate Sunil Sethi last week approached the court in Jammu to stay a direction issued by the single Bench, headed by Justice Hasnain Masoodi, on the State flag\u2019s right \u201cto be unfurled along with the National flag on government buildings, official meetings and official entourages.\u201d\n\nJustice Masoodi, whose judgment came just days before his retirement, also termed the change in nomenclature of Sadr-e-Riyasat into Governor \u201cagainst the structure of the Constitution.\u201d",
