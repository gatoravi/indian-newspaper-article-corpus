As part of its #Indiaforchennai initiative, nearly 200 kg were collected and passed on to a voluntary organisation in Chennai.\n\nThe material, collected from New Delhi, was delivered in the city by Indigo Airlines on Monday night to Chennai Rain Relief, which coordinated relief and rehabilitation work in the city. Around 8.30 p.m., relief goods weighing about 201 kg comprising materials including clothes, stationery, mosquito coils and footwear arrived at the Chennai airport; they were subsequently delivered to Sumita Pai of Chennai Rain Relief.\n\n\u201cWe will assess which areas require relief materials at this point in time and distribute the materials accordingly. We have covered hundreds of areas in Chennai and also places including Cuddalore, Nellore and Kancheepuram,\u201d she said.\n\nThe relief materials, including clothes, footwear, stationery items and mosquito coils began arriving to The Hindu from the time announcement was made about the initiative.",
