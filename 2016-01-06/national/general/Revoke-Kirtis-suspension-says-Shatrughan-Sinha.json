    "text": "BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Tuesday disagreed with his party\u2019s decision to suspend Kirti Azad, saying the decision was not sending a \u201cgood message\u201d as Mr. Azad was being seen as fighting \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nHe told PTI that the party should revoke the suspension.\n\nMr. Azad, the BJP\u2019s Darbhanga MP, was suspended from the party just after the winter session of Parliament for openly alleging corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association when Arun Jaitley headed it.\n\nReferring to Mr. Azad as \u201ca worthy son of a worthy father\u201d \u2013 a reference to Mr. Azad\u2019s father Bhagwat Jha Azad who was Chief Minister of Bihar \u2014 Mr. Sinha voiced support for party veterans like L.K. Advani, who have questioned the present leadership after the Bihar debacle. He rued that party president Amit Shah did not involve him in the Bihar polls. \u201cI found it very unfortunate that Azad, a worthy son of a worthy father, was suspended in this way. What has the general perception gone out? That he was talking about corruption,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.\n\nMr. Advani is releasing Mr. Sinha\u2019s autobiography \u2018Anything but Khamosh\u2019 (Anything but Silent) in the capital on Wednesday.",
