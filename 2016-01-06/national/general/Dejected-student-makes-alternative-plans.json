Dejected, he now plans to head to a new destination \u2014 Canada.\n\nVijayawada-based Kumar shared his 22-hour-long ordeal at New York airport with The Hindu .\n\nAfter pursuing a course in bio-technology from a local college, he applied for a seat in New England College, Henniker, New Hampshire in the U.S., to pursue Masters in Computer Information Sciences.\n\nOn December 30, he flew to London and from there to New York. Little did he know that the next few hours would change the course of his career plans. \u201cEven as the immigration officer was about to put the stamp, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer came and engaged him in a small talk. As he came to know that I was an Indian, the CBP officer exclaimed: \u201cMay be he is the last Indian coming through; I\u2019ll just grab him,\u201d and quickly took away my passport and I-20 from the immigration officer.\u201d\n\nAs Kumar walked along, the CBP officer asked him if he was doing some fraud. He scrutinised his passport and I-20 and asked him if he had paid the college fee and demanded to see the receipt.\n\nThe CBP also asked where he planned to stay in the U.S. and details about his accommodation. \u201cAfter a while, I was taken to a room, made to face the wall and frisked.\u201d\n\nThe terminal was about to close and so the CBP officer handed him over to two other officers who cuffed his hands in the back. \u201cWith my hands cuffed, they made me drag my luggage bag from one terminal to the other,\u201d he says.\n\nThey asked me to wait and this wait lasted for 16 hours. \u201cWhen I asked them what the problem was, they said I had \u2018bought\u2019 my visa. I was made to sit along with 20 other Indian students, all of them were seeking admissions in either Silicon Valley University (SVU) or Northwestern Polytechnic University (NPU) in California,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day afternoon, an officer named Raymond Nauth from U.S. Department of Homeland Security came to Kumar and asked him to show immigration papers. \u201cAfter verifying them, he discussed the issue with a female colleague saying the papers are alright and finding ground to stop me may not be possible,\u201d recalls Kumar.\n\nThe officer left the place and returned after a couple of hours. \u201cI pleaded with him to allow me to talk to my mother as she would be anxious to know about me. He agreed and I narrated the sequence to my mother.\u201d\n\nU.S.-bound Vijayawada student narrates his traumatic experience",
