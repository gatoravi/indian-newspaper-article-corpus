    "text": "The world\u2019s largest blue star sapphire, weighing 1,404.49 carats and valued at an astonishing $100 million, has been found in a mine in Sri Lanka.\n\nLankan gemmologists say the sapphire was found in the city of Ratnapura, known as the \u2018City of Gems\u2019, in southern Sri Lanka. It could be sold at auction for $175 million.\n\n\u201cThe moment I saw it, I decided to buy,\u201d said the sapphire\u2019s owner, who wants to remain anonymous. Armil Samnoon, a gem expert in Sri Lanka, said it was the biggest blue star sapphire in the world. The current record for the largest blue star sapphire is 1,395 carats, the report said.\n\nThe sapphire has been named the \u2018The Star of Adam\u2019 by its current owner, after an Islamic belief that Adam arrived in Sri Lanka after being sent away from the Garden of Eden. Blue star sapphires are so named because of the distinctive mark found at their centre. \u2014 PTI",
