    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Delhi government\u2019s duty to the public does not end with the odd-even policy and extends to helping commuters by increasing the number of buses and routes.\n\nThe Bench directed the government to comply with its July 27, 1998, order to augment the bus fleet from 5,000 to 10,000 vehicles. When the government complained that there was no space to park the buses as the DDA was yet to provide over half of the 78 acres allotted for it, the Bench asked Solicitor-General Ranjit Kumar to take instructions and get the land allotted for the purpose.\n\nTo pleas by car makers Mercedes, Toyota and Mahindra to alter its ban on registration of diesel luxury cars with over 2000 CC engine capacity, the court asked them to produce documentary evidence to prove that diesel cars pollute less than petrol ones. \u201cHow will you dispute the basic fact that diesel vehicles are not polluting the environment?\u201d the court said and asked, \u201cAre your vehicles emitting oxygen?\u201d",
