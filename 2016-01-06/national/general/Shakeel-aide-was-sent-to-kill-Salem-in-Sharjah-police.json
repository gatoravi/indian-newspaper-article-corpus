Balakrishnan. Further investigations revealed that Tublani was an important figure in 1993 bomb blasts accused Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar\u2019s gang and had even worked as a driver for Dawood\u2019s brother Anees in Dubai for eight years before coming back to India.\n\n\u201cIn 1998, Abu Salem, who earlier used to work for the Kaskar gang, parted ways with Dawood to set up his own gang. A year later, Tublani fled India and went to Dubai, after which he started working as a driver for Anees. Tublani\u2019s interrogation has revealed that the same year, Anees ordered Tublani to hunt down Salem, who was in Sharjah at the time, and kill him,\u201d said an officer.\n\nTublani allegedly said in his interrogation that he went to Sharjah and started his inquiries to find out Salem\u2019s whereabouts on Anees\u2019 instructions. However, he only got as far as finding Fazl-ur Rehman, an aide of Salem, who was also based in Sharjah.\n\n\u201cTublani tracked Rehman and demanded that he reveal Salem\u2019s whereabouts, and Rehman dismissively told him to leave him alone. The confrontation turned violent but Rehman did not yield to Tublani,\u201d the officer added.\n\nTublani also worked as a driver to Dawood\u2019s brother Anees in Dubai for eight years",
