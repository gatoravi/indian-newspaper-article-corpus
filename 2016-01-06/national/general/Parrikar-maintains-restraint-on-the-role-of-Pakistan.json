    "text": "Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was restrained in his criticism of Pakistan, in line with the tone adopted by the Modi government.\n\nAddressing the media here, the Minister said: \u201cThey [the terrorists] managed to enter the main premises with AK-47 rifles, underbarrel grenade launchers, over 50 kg of bullets, magazines, mortar and Swiss knife. The National Investigation Agency has leads that some of the weapons used by the terrorists were of Pakistani-make.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Parrikar, the flushing out part of the operation was over in 36 hours but the combing operation continued and is likely to stretch for a few day.\n\nEven as he confirmed that all six terrorists have been eliminated, Mr. Parrikar said that two of them had taken shelter in a building which had to be blown up. \u201cThese bodies were recovered in pieces and the NIA will conduct a DNA test on the remains for identification,\u201d said Mr. Parrikar.\n\nThe Minister insisted there was adequate security in place for the airbase, even while admitting to some gaps. He also, refused to answer questions about the failure of Punjab Police or BSF to prevent the attacks.\n\nHe congratulated all the forces for completing a challenging operation in a difficult area spread across 1900 acres and with plenty of blind spots for terrorists to hide.\n\nMr. Parrikar made a special mention of the Defence Security Corps constable Jagdish Singh, saying the country was proud of the man who killed a terrorist after snatching his rifle.\n\nMinister says NIA has leads showing that some of the weapons used by the terrorists were of Pakistani-make",
