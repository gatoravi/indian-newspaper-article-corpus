    "text": "The intercepted calls reveal that the terrorists who attacked the airbase in Pathankot spoke in Multani dialect, commonly used in the districts of Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur in southern Punjab of Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThis type of Punjabi is not spoken in India. The Multani dialect is common in south Punjab, Pakistan. This is a crucial pointer to the attackers being Pakistanis,\u201d a senior official told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cWe analysed the cell phone location and the calls only on January 2 when the attack had begun. The Punjab Police informed us only by afternoon,\u201d said the official.",
