    "text": "The Railways has proposed an option to buy travel insurance for the passengers and said the government was working with the insurance companies on the issue.\n\n\u201cThere is a continuous effort on our part to ensure safe and secure travel for our passengers, yet untoward incidents do occur. To minimise the financial loss to passengers from such events, we are working with insurance companies to offer optional travel insurance for rail journeys at the time of booking,\u201d Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said in his budget speech.\n\nWhile insurance companies welcomed the move, as it will increase insurance penetration, they also pointed out that delivery of services would be the key for the success of the plan.\n\n\u201cTaking a travel insurance while booking a rail journey would highly benefit rail travellers,\u201d M. Ravichandran, president, Insurance, TATA AIG General Insurance, said.",
