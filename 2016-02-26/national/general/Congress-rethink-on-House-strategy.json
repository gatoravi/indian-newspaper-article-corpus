    "text": "A day ahead of the start of the Parliament session on Monday, the Congress was confident of confronting the ruling BJP over the question of nationalism. But just two days later, with Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani mounting a strong defence of the government\u2019s actions at Hyderabad Central University and Jawaharlal Nehru University, the party is on the back foot to figure out its new line of attack .\n\nAt a strategy meeting on Thursday for the Parliament session, the Congress high command discussed what went wrong in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday evening, when Ms. Irani put up a spirited show, justifying the arrest of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Kanhaiya Kumar and defending her government from the public outrage triggered by Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide.\n\nSources said a section of senior Congress leadership expressed their disappointment saying that the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, instead of walking out of the house, should have challenged Ms. Irani over Vemula\u2019s suicide and over the \u201cserious law and order compromise\u201d at Patiala High Court where a BJP MLA and a group of lawyers beat up Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\nSenior Congress leader and a member of Rajya Sabha, Ashwini Kumar, told The Hindu that the party high command was still firm in taking up the JNU row.\n\nMr. Kumar said the party, however, would be more focussed on how to debate nationalism in the context of \u201cfreedom.\u201d",
