A new service \u201cClean my Coach\u201d service will also be introduced Pan-India through which a passenger will be able to request cleaning of his/her coach/toilets on demand through SMS.\n\nThe budget also proposes to install information boards in trains enumerating onboard services along with GPS-based digital displays inside coaches to provide real time information regarding upcoming halts. The Railway Ministry, in partnership with Google, will start Wi-Fi services at 100 stations this year, increasing it to 400 more stations in the next two years, the Minister said.\n\nTo keep boredom at bay onboard, Mr.Prabhu proposes a partnership with FM Radio stations and introduce Indian Railways bi-lingual magazine Rail Bandhu to all reserved classes of travellers in Mail/Express trains.\n\nThe magazine will be made available in all regional languages. Mr.Prabhu said that by 2020, the Railways would work towards meeting long-felt desires of the common man, including use of high-end technology to significantly improve the safety record, elimination of all unmanned level crossings and increasing punctuality to almost 95 per cent.",
