    "text": "The University of Hyderabad (UoH) on Thursday refuted HRD Minister Smriti Irani\u2019s statement in Parliament that medical personnel were denied access to research scholar Rohith Vemula in the immediate aftermath of his suicide on January 17. University officials said that a doctor had reached his hostel within minutes after learning of his suicide.\n\nLending weight to the denial is the medical report submitted by Rajashree P., who was the duty doctor at the varsity\u2019s Health Centre on January 17. \u201cReceived a phone call at 7.30 p.m. on 17/1/16 from NRS Hostel reporting that student was found hanging from the ceiling fan in room 207. Rushed to spot along with staff nurse, ambulance driver. By that time, the body has been kept on cot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reached the hostel about five minutes after I received the call at 7.30 p.m.,\u201d Dr. Rajashree told The Hindu . \u201cEven the police, whom I informed, reached the spot by 8 p.m.\u201d Her version is at complete variance with what Ms. Irani had said in Parliament a few days ago \u2014 that no doctor had gone near Rohith\u2019s body until 6.30 a.m. the next day.\n\nIn fact, after the MHRD statement, a UoH student Zikrullah Nisha posted on Facebook that he was the one who called the Health Centre immediately after security guards noticed Rohith\u2019s body hanging from the ceiling fan.",
