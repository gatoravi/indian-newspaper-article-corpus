    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the Railway Budget, tabled on Thursday, as one that caters to all sections of society and passenger-centric. The budget saw no increase in fares. It would \u201cstand out,\u201d the Prime Minister said, because, \u201cit is an infrastructure-led and employment-generating budget.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Modi singled out announcements to strengthen rail connectivity in Manipur and Mizoram, saying that it was \u201cgladdening\u201d as connectivity in the northeast is \u201cone of our core priorities.\u201d\n\nThe RSS is especially keen to expand its reach in the northeast, and the area has been a priority for the government, with over 200 visits by various Union Ministers to the area ever since the NDA government came to power.\n\n\u201cRail Budget showcases a vision to reorganise, restructure and rejuvenate railways with new processes, structures, norms and sources of revenue,\u201d Mr. Modi said. He said \u2018Vision 2020\u2019 in the budget will make the railways free from capacity constraints with higher train speed, punctuality and safety.\n\n\u201cIn the last year, we have seen a lot of success and this budget is an effort to further improve on this,\u201d he said, while noting that along with IT, investment has been given importance.\n\nHe said railways have witnessed 2.5 times more investment compared to what was seen in the budgets presented by previous governments and expressed the confidence that this budget would have long-term and positive contribution to the economy.\n\nDisappointing, say former Railway Ministers\n\nFormer Railway Ministers have expressed disappointment with the Railway Budget presented on Thursday.\n\nRJD president Lalu Prasad, who was the Railway Minister in UPA-I, called the budget a \u201cfraud\u201d on the people and said it had nothing new. There was no plan to increase the facilities for consumers and improve safety. \u201cTrain is off the track,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Railway Minister, Dinesh Trivedi, termed the budget a statement of illusion and said the government was misleading the nation. \u201cThis budget has no direction. It doesn\u2019t have any vision,\u201d Mr. Trivedi said.\n\nThe Congress leader and former Railway Minister, Pawan Bansal, said that except bio-vacuum toilets, there was nothing new. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, a Railway Minister once, said the budget did not have anything impressive. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for enhancing safety or improving cleanliness and timely running of trains,\u201d he said.",
