Santhals constitute more than 50 per cent of West Bengal\u2019s tribal population.\n\nMr. Hembram, 80, alumnus of the IIT, Kharagpur, who retired as Chief Architect in the Defence Ministry, is the present majhi [head] of the Santhals. He told The Hindu that Mahishasura was a supremely revered figure among the tribal people of West Bengal, parts of Odisha and Jharkhand.\n\n\u201cHe was not a mythical character but an historical icon who resisted the outsiders, the Aryans, before the birth of Christ. When he defeated the Aryans repeatedly, then a woman was sent [by the Aryans] to deceive him and thus society was defeated. Otherwise, eastern India, including Bengal, was under the control of indigenous societies and was called Bongadisum,\u201d Mr. Hembram said. He said Ms. Irani\u2019s comment was \u201ccondemnable\u201d and it would \u201cnegatively affect\u201d the BJP in the coming election.\n\nThe BJP did well in some of the tribal pockets of Bengal in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. In West Medinipur in south Bengal, the BJP was ahead of others in one Assembly segment and did reasonably well in the district. Undivided Medinipur, a former bastion of the Left, had nearly 20 per cent tribal population. In Bankura, with nearly 10 per cent tribal population, the BJP had scored around 20 per cent in all the 12 seats, emerging as a significant force. In north Bengal\u2019s Jalpaiguri district, which has nearly 15 per cent tribal population, the BJP got more than 30 per cent vote in more than one seat. In all these seats, the BJP could do well in the Assembly election, provided \u201cboth Mahishasura and Durga worshippers\u201d stay with them, observers said.\n\nSanthals and others resent Smriti Irani\u2019s statement in Parliament on their \u2018greatest hero\u2019",
