Then, one of them made a phone call and within a few minutes a mob of 150 to 250 lawyers attacked us with lathis and stones,\u201d K.K. Pandey, district unit secretary of the CPI(M), said.\n\nA trade union worker Avinash Mishra suffered injuries to his head and a dozen others suffered minor injuries in the attack.\n\nSexist remarks\n\nMr. Pandey who suffered injuries to his face said the lawyers who attacked them were shouting \u201cPakistan wapas jao (return to Pakistan)\u201d, \u201c deshdrohi ( traitor)\u201d and \u201c Vande mataram \u201d even as they assaulted protesters, some of whom were subjected to sexist remarks.\n\n\u201cThey even beat up a 70-year-old lawyer Kesar Gopal Tripathi and hurled abuses at women,\u201d Mr. Pandey said.\n\n\u201c\u2018I will shoot you.
