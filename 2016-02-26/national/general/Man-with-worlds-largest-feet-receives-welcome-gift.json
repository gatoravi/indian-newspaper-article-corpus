But it\u2019s virtually impossible for the Venezuelan man who holds the record for the world\u2019s largest feet.\n\nSo it is hard to overstate just how welcome the gift was Jeison Rodriguez received on Wednesday: four pairs of size-26 shoes.\n\nThe donation from Georg Wessels \u2014 a German shoemaker who specializes in making irregular-sized shoes \u2014 included boots, sneakers, clogs and sandals. \u201cI\u2019ve been making shoes for the world\u2019s tallest people for almost 40 years and I do it for free,\u201d Mr. Wessels said in a telephone interview.\n\nLoves to donate\n\nThe businessman says he has donated some 500 pairs of shoes.\n\n\u201cI never stop to think how much these shoes cost because they\u2019re gifts,\u201d he said. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized Mr. Rodriguez, 20, as having the world\u2019s largest feet in 2014. His right foot measures 15.8 inches and his left 15.6 inches.\n\nAlthough Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Wessels do not speak a common language, they have kept in touch since the German first gave him three pairs of shoes three years ago.\n\nMr. Rodriguez is also Venezuela\u2019s tallest man at 7 feet three inches. \u2014 AFP",
