    "text": "Former Finance and Home Minister P. Chidambaram has described the Union government\u2019s case against Jawaharlal Nehru University students charged with sedition as weak, saying, \u201cAny lawyer familiar with the law laid down in this behalf will know that this is not sedition.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Mr. Chidambaram said it was entirely \u201cpossible that there are some students whose sympathies lie with the Maoist movement, but unless there is incitement to violence, it is not sedition\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe slogan Pakistan Zindabad, etc. is heard every day in Kashmir. The slogan for Khalistan is heard almost every week in Punjab. There were people in Tamil Nadu who sing the praises of the LTTE and even glorify the LTTE cadres who were behind the killing of [former Prime Minister] Rajiv Gandhi. Some of it is clearly unacceptable and punishable. But is it punishable as sedition? That is the distinction we are drawing. Now which other law is attracted will depend on the nature of the provocation, the exact words that were uttered and the place and time and context in which they were uttered. Any lawyer familiar with the law laid down in this behalf will know that this is not sedition,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd even today, I find that the Police Commissioner is defending the charge sheet against Kanhaiya Kumar [president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students\u2019 Union] on the ground of sedition. Clearly, going through what Kanhaiya Kumar said on that day, it does not attract the law of sedition. In fact, I don\u2019t think his speech attracts any law at all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government was framing the debate on identities \u2014 on the killing of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri over the allegation of storing beef or the suicide of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad \u2014 in a polarising manner, distracting attention from bread and butter issues.\n\nHe said he had been in favour of withdrawing the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Jammu and Kashmir, but did not see it happening in this government.\n\nMr. Chidambaram said events in the rest of India and cases like that of Dadri and JNU would have consequences in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cSee, the mind of the Kashmiri youth gets affected not only by what happens in the Kashmir Valley. It also gets affected by what happens elsewhere in India. I think the increased sense of fear and insecurity among the Muslims is playing on the minds of Muslims all over India, including Muslims in Kashmir. How can one say that the Kashmiri youth are not concerned about what happens to other Muslims in the rest of India,\u201d he asked.\n\nHe denied that the previous Congress-led government had doubts over the culpability of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.\n\n\u201cI said one can hold an honest opinion that the case was not correctly decided and the degree of involvement of Afzal Guru was not correctly assessed. If someone holds that opinion, he doesn\u2019t become an anti-national. He\u2019s just holding a different opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, Mr. Chidambaram said the government was wrong in saying that it was possible to mention a cap in the rate of the GST in the Bill.\n\n\u201cOf course, capping the rate on the Bill can be done. What is the problem with that? [Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley] Mr. Jaitley\u2019s Bill, in one section, mentions the rate at one per cent. So why can\u2019t the Constitution Amendment Bill mention a rate? His own Bill mentions a rate. Secondly, the profession tax provision of the Constitution \u2014 Article 276 \u2014 contains a cap of Rs. 2,500. That number is mentioned in the Constitution. So mentioning a cap in the Constitution is not unprecedented.\u201d\n\n(For full interview visit: http://bit.ly/1S3HAL0)",
