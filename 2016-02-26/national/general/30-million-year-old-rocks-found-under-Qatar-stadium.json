This is an extraordinary find,\u201d he added.\n\nExcavation at the site reached 17 metres in depth. Dukhan is a city in the west of Qatar.\n\nEight stadiums will be used for the competition in Qatar, including the Qatar Foundation stadium, which is seven km west of the capital, Doha.\n\nQatar\u2019s bid has been beset by controversy, with allegations that living and working conditions for World Cup labourers are appalling leading to a number of deaths, a charge denied by organisers. In addition, an investigation is continuing in Switzerland about how the Gulf country was selected as the host for the 2022 tournament, following corruption allegations against Doha. \u2014 AFP\n\nThe rocks were formed under water, forming a layer known as the middle-Eocene epoch",
