There was no doubt that the AMU is a minority institution. The granting of the legal status of a university in 1920 had in no way diluted its main character, that it was established by Muslims and for Muslims of India,\u201d Mr. Jethmalani added.\n\nThe case regarding the minority character of AMU is scheduled to be heard in the apex court on April 4.",
