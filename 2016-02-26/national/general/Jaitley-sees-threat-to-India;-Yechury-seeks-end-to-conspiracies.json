Matters had started civilly enough in the morning when the discussion commenced, with Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanding the setting up of a parliamentary committee to look into the situation in various Central universities.\n\nMr. Yechury invoked William Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth to \u201cforewarn\u201d the advent of a \u201ctheocratic, fascist Hindu Rashtra\u201d. Referring to the characterisation of the Left by Meenakshi Lekhi, BJP member in the Lok Sabha, as \u201cwitches in the fairy tale of India\u2019s growth story\u201d, Mr. Yechury launched a scathing attack on the government.\n\n\u201cYes, we are witches. We forewarn. Understand the prophecy of witches,\u201d he said referring to the song of the witches in Macbeth , which he recited, that foresees doom for the rulers, that the king today may not be king tomorrow.\n\nHe asked the government \u201cnot to castigate the entire student community and the institutions\u201d, and \u201cstop this tirade for advancing your brand of nationalism\u201d.\n\nReferring to Rohith Vemula, the Dalit student of Hyderabad University, he said the termination of his scholarship led to his suicide.\n\nMr Yechury said such interference was not only limited to the JNU or Hyderabad University, but could be seen in other institutions also, and \u201ctoday you are castigating the entire university as anti-national.\u201d\n\nOn the JNU and the speech by its students\u2019 union president Kanhaiya Kumar, he said, \u201cI too want aazadi [freedom]. I want freedom from hunger, Manuwad [ancient religious laws] and poverty. You arrest me if you want to for that, but stop conspiring against our children.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is the Leader of the House, then made an intervention to answer these charges.\n\nMr. Jaitley trained his guns at the Congress and the Left jointly, suggesting that they had jumped into the JNU issue \u201cwithout giving prior thought\u201d in view of the Assembly elections in West Bengal. \u201cThere are three Congresses in West Bengal \u2014 the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress [Marxist]\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Jaitley cited a Parliament Question of 1983 in which the then Indira Gandhi government justified the entry of the police into the JNU and the arrest of 350 students, including 50 girls, after the Vice-Chancellor was gheraoed.\n\nHe contended that the developments of February 9 at the JNU were \u201cmuch more serious\u201d as he read out the pamphlets carrying anti-India material allegedly circulated on the campus.\n\n\u201cThe core question is, are we going to give respectability to those whose primary ideology is that they want to break this country,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to slogans which called for war for destruction of the country and lauded terrorists who had been convicted by the highest judiciary, Mr. Jaitley questioned: \u201cCan hate speech be called free speech?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious offence. One is Jihadist, the other is Maoist. It\u2019s an alliance of the two. You have been in power for long, you should have thought before making a visit to the JNU campus,\u201d he said in a direct reference to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit to the JNU.",
