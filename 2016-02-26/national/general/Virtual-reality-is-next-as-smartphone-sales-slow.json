Companies like Samsung, LG and HTC are showing off their latest virtual reality headsets as others are showing new content or new applications for a virtual reality world. \u2014 Photo: AFP\n\nPhone makers, trying to renew consumer appetite, are turning to virtual reality headsets that can be paired with their devices to view videos and play games.\n\n\u201cWith a slowing smartphone market, one of the ways to generate additional profit is to become a major player in new categories like smartwatches, cameras or virtual reality goggles,\u201d said Ian Fogg, head of mobile at research firm IHS.\n\n\u201cThese are markets where there is not yet a leader so there is a lot more room for growth,\u201d he said.\n\nFreebie with phones\n\nSamsung, the world\u2019s number one smartphone maker, announced at the Mobile World Congress trade fair in Barcelona that it would give away its Gear VR headset for free with every pre-order for its new flagship Galaxy S7 phone.\n\nThousands of people donned the headsets \u2014 which have a slot where you insert a smartphone \u2014 to view the presentation of the firm\u2019s new phones at a Barcelona congress centre on the eve of the start of the fair.\n\nThe crowd gasped and applauded as the new phones appeared to be floating in the air before their eyes.\n\nWhen they removed their headsets they saw that Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg had made a surprise appearance at the presentation.\n\nSaturated market\n\nThe headsets \u2014 which went on sale in November \u2014 are powered by technology developed by Oculus, a virtual reality company Facebook bought in 2014 for $2 billion.\n\n\u201cVR is the next platform where anyone can experience anything they want,\u201d he said.\n\nRival South Korean tech firm LG, which lost money from its mobile business last year, unveiled its own virtual reality goggles to go with its new G5 smartphone at the fair.\n\n\u201cIf this does not tell you the industry is moving to virtual reality, I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d said Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting that focuses on the wireless and tech sectors.\n\nThe emphasis on virtual reality comes as the increasingly-saturated smartphone market begins to slow.\n\nResearch firm TrendForce predicts global smartphone sales will grow by 8.1 per cent in 2016, down from 10.3 per cent last year.\n\nStruggling Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC has decided to refocus completely on virtual reality and away from smartphones.\n\n\u201cYes, smartphones are important, but to create a natural extension to other connected devices like wearables (watches...) and virtual reality is more important,\u201d the company\u2019s new chief executive Cher Wang said last month in an interview with The Telegraph .\n\nThe smartphone virtual reality headsets sparked huge interest at the trade fair in Barcelona, which ended on Thursday.\n\nLong lines formed outside a pop-up virtual reality theatre set up by Samsung that allowed people to experience a roller coaster ride using the Gear VR headset as their seats rocked from side to side.\n\nTilt your head back with the headset on and you see a clear blue sky. Turn sideways and you see the rest of an amusement park and mountains in the distance. Look down and you see a fast approaching plunge.\n\nPeople gripped the arms of their seats even though they were not moving and raised their hands in the air during the simulations.\n\nHere to stay\n\nResearch firm CCS Insight predicts the number of sold virtual reality devices will grow from 2.2 million last year to 20 million in 2018, with smartphone-based devices representing the vast majority.\n\n\u201cSmartphone virtual reality is poised to be the big volume driver for virtual reality in coming years,\u201d the company\u2019s chief of research, Ben Wood, said.\n\nMore sophisticated virtual reality headsets that run on an expensive computer will remain a niche product because of their high cost, he added.\n\nSome users of the smartphone virtual reality headsets complained of being able to see the pixels in the images being broadcast.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the systems is not quite there yet,\u201d said Edward Tang, founder and president of Avegant which makes virtual reality headsets.\n\n\u201cBut there is no doubt virtual reality is here to stay,\u201d he said. \u2014 AFP\n\nThousands of people tried on the headsets at the Mobile World Congress show",
