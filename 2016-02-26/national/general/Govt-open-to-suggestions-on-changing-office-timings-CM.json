It has also been decided to form sub-groups on research and logistics, software development, testing and quality control and also helpdesk and grievance cell. The main posts would be filled up through direct selection, deputation and promotion.\n\nAs much as 25 per cent of the Plan fund of grama panchayats, municipalities and corporations and 10 per cent of the Plan fund of district panchayats and block panchayats would be provided as working capital of mission. This would amount to Rs.10 crore and is in addition to a budgetary allocation of Rs.10 crore and a proposal to mobilise Rs.2 crore through consultancy services.\n\nRehabilitation package\n\nThe government would implement a rehabilitation package of Rs.23.8 crore for the fishermen who have been permanently rendered jobless on implementing the Vizhinjam project.
