Thakur and Justice U.U. Lalit disposed of a PIL petition, filed by Delhi Jal Board, for a direction to ensure supply of water tdisrupted by the violent Jat quota agitation in Haryana.\n\n\u201cWe hope and trust that the governments of Haryana and NCT of Delhi will make a joint effort to ensure supply of water to Delhi to avoid any inconvenience to people. We are happy to note that there is no adversarial element in this litigation, as both the governments appear to be willing to cooperate with each other in every respect,\u201d it said.",
