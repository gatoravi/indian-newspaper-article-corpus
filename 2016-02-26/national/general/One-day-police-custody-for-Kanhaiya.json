    "text": "JNU Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, lodged in Tihar Central Jail in connection with a sedition case slapped on him, was remanded in a day\u2019s police custody on Thursday after the Delhi Police said it required him for being confronted with two other JNU students who have since surrendered.\n\nThe court allowed the prosecution's application for one-day police custody for the student leader who was arrested on February 12 and sent to judicial custody after five days.\n\nThe jail authorities produced Kumar in the court following a production warrant issued on the plea of Delhi Police, which said the statements of JNU students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya regarding the controversial university event did not match with those made by Kumar during his interrogation.\n\nThe police custody will enable the investigating officers to question all the three accused students together and get details about the February 9 event marking the anniversary of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru's hanging, in which anti-India slogans were allegedly raised.",
