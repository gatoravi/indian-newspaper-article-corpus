    "text": "A video shoot of twin students at GMLP School, Cherumukku, held on Monday with the sanction of the gram panchayat.\n\nThe Nannambra gram panchayat, which looks after Kodinhi and Cherumukku, the two little villages that have grabbed international attention because of hundreds of twins being born there, has decided to restrict visitors and media persons who turn up there to photograph and videograph the twins. The panchayat has banned all photo shoots and media coverage of the twins and their families without its consent.\n\nPanchayat president M.P. Mohammed Hasan says the decision was also taken to prevent the \u201cexploitation\u201d of those turning up to shoot the twins and their families. There have been many instances of curious visitors, including foreigners and journalists, being fleeced by local touts who arrange for meeting the twins.\n\n\u201cThere have been too many cases of blatant exploitation in the name of the twins. We want to bring in some order and accountability to people coming to shoot and talk to the twins,\u201d Mr. Hasan said.\n\nThe panchayat authorities said they would take up the matter of twins more seriously soon.\n\n\u201cWe want this phenomenon to be scientifically studied. We will take up this issue after March,\u201d Mr. Hasan said.\n\nThe panchayat restriction on visitors has generally been welcomed by the local people.\n\nA.K. Mustafa, a social worker at Cherumukku, said it would actually help people visiting the village to look up the rare phenomenon.\n\n548 pairs, and counting\n\nIn Kodinhi alone, there are 548 pairs of twins, according to the figures provided by the panchayat.\n\nThe panchayat has banned all photo shoots and media coverage without its consent",
