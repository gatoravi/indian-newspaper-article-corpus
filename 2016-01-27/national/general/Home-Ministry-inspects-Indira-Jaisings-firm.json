When contacted, Ms. Jaising refused to comment.\n\nA senior Home Ministry official said: \u201cWe had sent the firm a questionnaire and asked it to respond. It asked for three extensions and we gave it too. Last week, a Home Ministry team inspected the accounts of the firm at its office in Mumbai and Delhi. Based on our findings, we will decide on the future course of action.\u201d\n\nMs. Jaising had filed a detailed reply with the Ministry.\n\n\u201cWe were not satisfied with the response and we wanted to cross-check certain facts. That\u2019s why we inspected the accounts,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Ministry had sent the notice on a complaint filed by Jaipur resident Raj Kumar Sharma in which he alleged that Lawyers\u2019 Collective received funds from Ford Foundation, Levi Strauss Foundation and Open Society Foundation.",
