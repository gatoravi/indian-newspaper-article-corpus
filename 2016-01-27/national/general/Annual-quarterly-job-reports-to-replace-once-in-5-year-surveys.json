An estimated million people are joining India\u2019s workforce every month thanks to its demographic dividend of a high number of youth in the population.\n\nAs of now, the only employment data in India is available through quinquennial (once every five years) surveys by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), a limited ad-hoc survey of employment in a few sectors that was initiated by the Labour Bureau after the global financial crisis in 2008 and the Annual Survey of Industries (which only captures the employees of the registered factories).\n\nBy contrast, developed markets have quarterly official data on employment, if not monthly reports, that help them assess the state of the economy better.\n\nThe NSSO has readied the design, modalities and mechanisms for conducting the survey and could start as soon as the nod comes for the formal proposal of the Statistics Ministry. \u201cWe are planning to move to a more regular survey \u2013 conducted annually, with some reports coming out on a quarterly basis,\u201d said TCA Anant, Secretary, Ministry of Statistics.\n\n\u201cA survey requires resources \u2013 both finance and people. We have worked out many things\u2026 there are procedures to be followed before we can commit when we can start and in what form, as they interact with each other. A proposal has been finalised for competent approval,\u201d Mr Anant told The Hindu, stressing that though the ministry is hopeful of starting the survey, it is still under \u2018administrative examination.\u2019\n\nWhile NSS surveys are usually spread over a whole financial year, the design plan for the employment survey includes a regular annual survey with certain systems for urban areas that will enable generation of quarterly estimates, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) work is now done through a web portal. Our consumer price index (CPI) collection is much more robust as all the data is gathered through an IT network developed by the Department of Posts, which we are piggybacking on to get data transmitted,\u201d Mr Anant said, adding a similar approach will be used for capturing employment numbers.\n\nNational Statistics Commission had first called for a periodic labour force survey in 2009 and a pilot survey was undertaken in 2012-13.",
