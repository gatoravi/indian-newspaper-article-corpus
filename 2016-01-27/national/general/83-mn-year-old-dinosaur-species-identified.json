    "text": "Researchers have identified and named an 83-million-years-old species of a rare, primitive duck-billed dinosaur, after studying its fossils discovered in the eastern United States.\n\nThis new discovery also shows that duck-billed dinosaurs originated in the eastern US, what was then broadly referred to as Appalachia, before dispersing to other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a really important animal telling us how they came to be and how they spread all over the world,\u201d said Gregory Erickson, a professor at the Florida State University.\n\nThe researchers have named the new dinosaur Eotrachodon orientalis , which means \u201cdawn rough tooth from the East.\u201d\n\nThis duck-billed dinosaur \u2014 also known as a Hadrosaurid \u2014 was probably 20 to 30 feet long as an adult and mostly walked on its hind legs, though it could come down on all four to graze on plants with its grinding teeth and had a scaly exterior.\n\nA large crest on the nose, plus indentations found in the skull and its unique teeth alerted the researchers from McWane Science Centre in US and the University of Bristol in UK that the skeleton they had was something special.\n\nThe skeletal remains of this rare dinosaur were originally found by a team of amateur fossil enthusiasts alongside a creek in Alabama in marine sediment. The dinosaur likely was washed out to sea by river or stream sediments after it died, researchers said.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology. \u2014 PTI",
