The MoU recorded that we have made progress,\u201d highly placed sources told The Hindu .\n\nA senior French official clarified that when Mr. Hollande said financial issues would be sorted out in a \u201ccouple of days,\u201d what he meant was the team which had been here would pick up negotiations in the next few days.\n\nThere was an interchange of terms between MoU and IGA on Monday after the joint press conference by the two leaders. While initially it was read out that an MoU was signed on Rafale, Mr. Modi in his address stated that they had concluded the Inter-Governmental Agreement pending \u201csome financial issues\u201d to be resolved soon. And the joint statement issued by the government mentioned the same.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders welcomed the conclusion of the Inter-Governmental Agreement [IGA] on the acquisition of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft in flyaway condition, except for some financial issues \u2026 ,\u201d the statement said. However, briefing the media later Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar clarified that it was an MoU.\n\nIt has been learnt that except for the pricing, other issues such as the schedule, supply and maintenance issues have been frozen but French officials were quick to point out that any additional changes would mean renegotiating the deal afresh causing further delay.\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about a standard configuration; we are talking about an India-specific aircraft. Given that the speed is at a remarkable pace,\u201d another senior official said.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu earlier, the pricing of the aircraft has been a sticking point even as the issue of offsets has been sorted out. Officials had said that the cost per aircraft is over \u20ac 100 million or about Rs. 740 crore and efforts are on to reduce the price.\n\nIn addition, the Indian Air Force has asked for customisation on the aircraft as per its requirements, which, France said, would delay deliveries.",
