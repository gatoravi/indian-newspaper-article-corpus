    "text": "Two men from Telangana, who recently left the country to fight alongside the Islamic State (IS) in Syria, were in close contact with at least four of the 14 terror suspects arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last week, a senior government official said.\n\nTwo other members of the group \u2014 Faizan and Arfan \u2014 who were also part of the Hyderabad module are said to be absconding and had acquired visa for Japan, the probe has revealed.\n\nThe two men, both from Telangana, have been identified as Arshad Ali and Kadir, both in their mid-twenties. Ali, first went to Singapore and from there he travelled to Syria four months ago. Kabir, who took a job in Dubai, travelled to the conflict zone around two months ago, said an official.\n\nThe four men in the NIA custody now \u2014 Nafeez Khan, Obedullah Khan, Mohammad Shariff Mohiuddin and Abu Anas \u2014 were in touch with the two men who travelled to Syria.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the Islamic State is trying to recruit at multiple levels in India. The present module was not under the radar of the State police but the Central intelligence agencies had been keeping a watch on them,\u201d said the official.\n\nThe Hindu had reported on December 26 that two more men of Indian origin had travelled to Iraq-Syria but their identities were not known then. The number of Indians who are believed to have joined the terrorist outfit now stands at 25, up from 17 in August last year.\n\nAnother official said, \u201cTheir preliminary interrogation shows that they wanted to increase the numbers of their followers here and organise attacks to establish a caliphate here,\u201d said the official.",
