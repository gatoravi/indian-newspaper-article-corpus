We are stopped unconstitutionally on the occasion of Republic Day. We have not resorted to any violence to achieve our goal. Why is Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis permitting this?\u201d asked Ms. Desai.\n\nFollowing a half-hour stalemate in which the police refused to yield, the agitators led by Ms. Desai resorted to a sit-down strike, singing bhajans and kirtans , proclaiming their resolution to remain there until the police permitted them to pass.\n\nInside the temple\u2019s inner sanctum, meanwhile, steel barricades cordoning off the platform were put in place early in the morning while thousands of villagers from Shani Shingnapur, opposing the RBB\u2019s campaign, formed a \u2018counter-campaign pandal \u2019 announcing their intent to uphold the temple tradition.\n\nThe locals were joined by activists of right-wing groups represented by the women\u2019s wing of the ruling Shiv Sena and various other outfits belonging to the fringe-right, represented by the Sanatan Sanstha, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti and its women\u2019s wing Ranragini Shakha. Earlier, after the Pune Collector denied permission for a helicopter flight, the RBB president jettisoned her plan of rappelling down to enter inner sanctum.",
