    "text": "Fails to meet Airbnb occupancy standards\n\nAn enterprising New Yorker sought to turn a walloping snowfall into a money spinner by building an igloo in his backyard and advertising it as a boutique getaway for two on Airbnb for $200 a night.\n\nBut freelance art director Patrick Horton said his icy listing lasted on the property-sharing website just six hours before he was informed that it was being removed for not meeting occupancy standards.\n\nMr. Horton said he and two roommates spent six hours building Brooklyn\u2019s answer to a traditional Arctic home.\n\nHe then advertised the \u2018Boutique Winter Igloo for 2\u2019 on Airbnb in hip neighbourhood Greenpoint.\n\nDespite Airbnb giving him the cold shoulder, Mr. Horton says he got five enquiries while the listing was live.\n\n\u201cInterestingly enough, Airbnb actually allows igloos to be rented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are igloos on their site, but for some reason ours did not meet the qualifications.\u201d\n\nAirbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Horton says he is thinking about advertising it on Craigslist, despite a second day of warmer temperatures that has seen some of New York\u2019s enormous snowfall melt. \u2014 AFP",
