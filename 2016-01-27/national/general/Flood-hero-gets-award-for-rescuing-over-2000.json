Ragu\n\nThe State government has honoured 26-year old S. Mohammad Yunus for his \u201cselfless, noble and brave act\u201d of rescuing nearly 2,100 people during the recent floods that devastated Chennai.\n\n\u201cIf you had met me a few months back, you would have been shocked. I used to work like a money-making machine. I was never a social person. The floods taught me a great lesson. It was an eye-opener for me,\u201d he said after receiving the \u2018Anna Medal for Gallantry\u2019 from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at the 67{+t}{+h}Republic Day celebrations.\n\nNow, he wants to teach politics and reform the youth. \u201cI\u2019m developing an app with focus on entrepreneurship, reforms and politics. It will be up ready and operational in three months. This will be similar to social networking apps,\u201d Mr. Yunus said.\n\nOn funding for his new venture, he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Venture Capital funding and some have already approached me.\u201d",
