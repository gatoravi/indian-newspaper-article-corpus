He began on January 11 and expects to take around four weeks to reach Kathmandu, covering a distance of around 3,200 km.\n\nMr. Rajani wants to create awareness of safety in cycling through this journey. \u201cWearing a helmet, visible clothing and fitting your cycle with lights are essential,\u201d he says.\n\nOn reaching Nepal, he plans to also either cycle or trek from Lukla to the Mount Everest base camp. The adventure does not end there, however. Mr. Rajani will be cycling to Gujarat covering around 1,800 km and expecting to take around six weeks with breaks to meet family and friends along the way.\n\nMr. Rajani, who lives in Leicester, the U.K., is self-employed and offers plumbing services. When the weather in the U.K. does not permit cycling, he continues to keep fit by trekking and walking, he says.\n\nOn the \u2018KKK,\u2019 he is using a foldable Brompton MR6 cycle, with six gears, costing around \u00a31200 to \u00a31500 (nearly Rs. 1.5 lakh). Its ability to fold neatly means he can easily carry it into restaurants and hotel rooms when he stays there at nights. \u201cThis is actually a commuting bicycle. I wanted to also show that it is possible to cover long distances on it and carry luggage,\u201d he says.",
