Notable among these was the enforcement of social strictures against marriage between castes, as enshrined in the Dharmasastra . This reveals that some social norms leave imprints on the DNA, which can be reconstructed by careful genetic studies,\u201d says Partha P. Majumder, Director, NIBMG, who, along with Analabha Basu and Neeta Sarkar Roy, authored the study.\n\nBy looking at the block lengths of ancestral genes, the team could pinpoint the era when mixing of castes ended. In the case of West Bengal Brahmins, marriages with the northeastern communities continued until the arrival of the 8th century Pala dynasty which cut off these regions.\n\nThe block lengths of ancestral genes pointed to the era when mixing of castes ended",
