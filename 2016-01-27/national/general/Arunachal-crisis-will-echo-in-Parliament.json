In this case, the budget session. The party will oppose it tooth and nail and try and build opposition unity around the issue,\u201d said a top source in the party.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the Janata Dal (U) also issued a statement in support of the Congress, appealing to all non-BJP parties to unite in raising the issue in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThis decision of the NDA-led Central government is an attempt to sabotage the Constitutional mandate, which is a threat to democracy. This act also shows the BJP\u2019s mindset towards cooperative federalism. The JD(U) calls upon all non-BJP parties including NDA partners Telugu Desam Party, People\u2019s Democratic Party, Shiv Sena and Akali Dal to stand together in the hour of need and raise the issue in the upcoming budget session,\u201d the statement read. The opposition enjoys comfort in numbers in the Rajya Sabha and the imposition of President\u2019s Rule in an Opposition-run state has set the stage for a stormy Budget Session.\n\nBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said the imposition of President\u2019s rule was a \u201cdisaster\u201d in the making. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal likened the situation to the Emergency. \u201cPresident\u2019s rule in Arunachal. Advaniji was right in saying that there are Emergency-like conditions in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nArunachal Pradesh plunged into a political crisis in June last year after a section of tCongress MLAs (14 of them) was suspended by Speaker Nabam Rebia, along with two Ministers. The Congress retained its majority, but very soon Deputy Speaker T.N. Thongdok cleared an impeachment motion against the Speaker \u201cowing to his personal relationship with Chief Minister Nabam Tuki\u201d.",
