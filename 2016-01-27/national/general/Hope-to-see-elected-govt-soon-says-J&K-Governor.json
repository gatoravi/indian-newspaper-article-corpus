While thin traffic was observed on the roads, all major business centres and markets remained closed. Most separatists were placed under house arrest and many protesters detained on the occasion.\n\n\u201cThe shutdown is a referendum against the rulers,\u201d said Mr. Geelani.\n\nFirebrand legislator Engineer Rashid accused the authorities of disallowing him to attend the R-Day function despite an invite.\n\nMilitant killed\n\nIn south Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag district, a militant was shot dead in a brief encounter.
