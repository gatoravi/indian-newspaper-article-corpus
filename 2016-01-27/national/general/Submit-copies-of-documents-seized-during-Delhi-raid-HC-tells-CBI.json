    "text": ": The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the CBI to submit in two days photocopies of documents seized from the office of the Delhi government\u2019s Principal Secretary, Rajendra Kumar, in connection with a corruption case last month.\n\nJustice P.S. Teji said the court wanted to examine whether the papers were relevant and could be retained by the probe agency for investigating the alleged charges against Mr. Kumar.\n\nJustice Teji was hearing a revision petition challenging a lower court order directing the CBI to return the documents, in original, to the Delhi government as they were not relevant to the probe.\n\nThe court posted the matter for hearing to January 29.\n\n\u2018Order misconceived\u2019\n\nIn its petition, the CBI said the Special CBI Judge failed to appreciate the fact that the Delhi government had already obtained photocopies of the documents and, thus, the order of returning the documents was wholly misconceived. The judge also failed to appreciate that the right of investigation was its inherent right, which could not be curtailed by passing such orders, the CBI petition said.\n\nThe Delhi government urged the court to dismiss the CBI plea, saying \u201cthat the CBI has filed a frivolous, baseless, vexatious and merit-less petition with obtuse motives.\u201d\n\nA special court for CBI cases on January 20 directed the investigating agency to return these documents to the Delhi government.\n\nThe government had sought back these documents arguing that they were unrelated to and unnecessary for the investigation of the case against the senior officer and others.\n\nThe court wanted to examine whether the papers were relevant and could be retained by CBI",
