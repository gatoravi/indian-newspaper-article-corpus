He told them he worked as an international business manager for Nottingham-based Octavian and was visiting its U.S. branch in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cIn the space of 20 minutes they concluded that I was an illegal immigrant working in America, denying a U.S. citizen a job,\u201d Mr. Surana claimed. \u201cThe whole experience was traumatic, frightening, embarrassing, stressing and haunting for me and my family. I have never had a criminal record. I have an education and an international executive job. I wish this on nobody,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, CBP said that it \u201cfirmly denies any claims that a traveller can be subject to an admissibility interview because of racial profiling. CBP is charged with inspecting all travellers regardless of nationality, race, sex, religion, faith or spiritual beliefs.\u201d \u2014 PTI\n\n\u2018I have never had a criminal record. I was profiled owing to my appearance,\u2019 says Amreet Surana",
