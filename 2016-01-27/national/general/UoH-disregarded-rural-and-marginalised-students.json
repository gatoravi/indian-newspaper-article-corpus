The team met students, faculty, friends and family of Rohith Vemula and available administration authorities. In a report released to the media here, the committee recalled the series of events leading to the suicide of Rohith and felt that there was a clear abdication of duty from the office of the Vice-Chancellor in acting in the best interests of students and failing to take cognisance of recurring suicides by students from rural and marginalised communities. \u201cComprehensive investigations were taken up only in some cases is disturbing.\u201d",
