Notable among these was the enforcement of social strictures against marriage between castes, as enshrined in the Dharmasastra . This reveals that some social norms leave imprints on the DNA, which can be reconstructed by careful genetic studies,\u201d says Partha P. Majumder, Director, NIBMG, who, along with Analabha Basu and Neeta Sarkar Roy, authored the study.\n\nBy looking at the block lengths of ancestral genes, the team could pinpoint the era when mixing of castes ended. In the case of West Bengal Brahmins, marriages with the northeastern communities continued until the arrival of the 8th century Pala dynasty which cut off these regions.\n\nFor the Marathas, it was during Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas (nearly 1,100 years ago) when warriors (Kshatriyas) were drawn from the peasantry class and eventually, the mixing of the population with tribes and Dravidian communities halted.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was mixing between tribes of various ancestries that ended the last.\n\nHowever, the researchers have noted that \u201cmixing\u201d of genetic populations continued in an \u201casymmetric\u201d trickle after this. Upper caste populations continued to give genetic inputs to lower caste and tribal populations \u2014 but not vice-versa.\n\nThis is \u201cconsistent with elite dominance and patriarchy\u201d of the upper caste, notes the study.\n\n\u201cMale members of upper caste communities have had off-spring with other communities, but the reverse is not seen. This is possible by an elite group [sharing the similar genes] dominating non-elite groups,\u201d says Partha P. Majumder, Director, NIBMG, who, along with Analabha Basu and Neeta Sarkar Roy, authored the study.\n\nResearchers analysed \u201chigh quality\u201d genotype data of 367 individuals drawn from 20 ethnic populations.\n\nThe samples ranged in caste, linguistic as well as geographic variations: from \u201cupper caste\u201d \u2014 Gujarati, Manipuri, West Bengal Brahmins and Marathas \u2014 to Dravidian communities \u2014 Pallan, Irula, among others \u2014 to Central and Eastern Indian tribes \u2014 Ho, Santhal, Birhor.\n\nFrom Andaman and Nicobar islands, the Jarawa and Onge tribes were chosen for the study \u2014 and these tribes were found to have ancestries closer to the Pacific Islanders than those in mainland India.\n\nApart from the historical linkages shown, the study also shows the complex ancestries that now make up the Indian population.\n\nWhile a previous study published in Nature in 2009 by Harvard geneticist David Reich and his team, showed that most Indians could trace their roots in Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI) genes; the NIBMG team shows a significant presence of the Ancestral Tibeto-Burman (ATB) genes in communities in the North-East as well as Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA) genes among the tribal populations of east and central India.",
