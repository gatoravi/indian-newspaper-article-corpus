Slamming the Opposition for \u201cfaking\u201d solidarity, Mr. Raj alleged that they were trying to gain political mileage out of the issue.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , he said: \u201cI am against this selective support of the students as well as the Opposition parties. The state of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh is the worst. Officials are being demoted all of a sudden for no reason and forget reservations, students fail to get a seat.\u201d",
