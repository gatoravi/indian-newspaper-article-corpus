Contributions to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) are mandatory for those earning up to Rs. 15,000 a month in all organisations with 20 or more employees.\n\n\u201cAs per the Council\u2019s regulations, each dental college is required to have a minimum number of employees, including teaching and non-teaching staff, which is above the threshold of 20 employees under the EPF law,\u201d the intelligence unit in the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) said in a memo sent to senior PF commissioners last week.\n\nOf the 276 private dental colleges, nearly 117 have not yet registered themselves with the EPFO, while 17 have defaulted on employees\u2019 PF contributions after their enrolment.\n\n\u201cThe Dental Council of India carries out periodic inspections of dental colleges and has definite information on their manpower,\u201d the memo pointed out.\n\n\u201cAll offices are requested to verify the level of compliance by dental colleges in their jurisdiction and take action against those who have failed to comply with the law,\u201d the memo said, calling for an action-taken report from PF offices by the first week of February.\n\nTN colleges\n\nAs per the data compiled by the central analysis and intelligence unit, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have the highest number of colleges evading PF dues.\n\nThese States account for 75 of the 134 colleges that have not registered themselves with the EPFO or defaulted on payments. In other States, however, the proportion of colleges not paying PF dues is higher than the total number of colleges.\n\nIn Gujarat, for instance, eight of 12 dental colleges don\u2019t pay PF dues. Eight colleges each in Madhya Pradesh and Punjab don\u2019t give PF benefits, of a total of 13 and 14 colleges in these States.\n\nAs per the EPF Act, 1952, employers are required to credit 12 per cent of an employee\u2019s salary every month into their PF accounts to build a retirement corpus. An additional 12 per cent of salary is deducted as employees\u2019 contribution.",
