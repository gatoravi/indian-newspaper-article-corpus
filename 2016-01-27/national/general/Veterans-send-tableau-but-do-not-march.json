This comes in the backdrop of protests by veterans over the issue of one rank, one pension (OROP) and their call for boycott of the celebrations.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the parade will also see an ex-servicemen tableau, where Army veterans with their eye-catching float will pass the saluting dais, wherein pioneering role of ex-servicemen in nation-building will be displayed,\u201d Defence Ministry had said in a statement ahead of Republic Day.\n\nVeterans have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for implementation of OROP in its \u201crightful form\u201d and had boycotted the 1965 war commemorative celebrations last year. They also announced a boycott of all government functions till the issue was resolved.\n\n\u201cWe want the OROP after removing the seven shortcomings. Till such time we will continue with the agitation. We will boycott January 26 (celebration) and we will also make a request to the marching contingent not to take part (in the parade),\u201d said Maj Gen Satbir Singh (retd), Chairman of Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement (IESM) had announced at a rally in May Last year.\n\nResponding to the development, Group Captain VK Gandhi, General Secretary of the IESM, said it was a wrong decision by the government of not having a marching contingent that had been happening for the past several years.\n\n\u201cWe had given a boycott call of all government functions, so it could have probably been done to avoid embarrassment,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a senior defence official said it was done to adhere to a truncated time line of the parade. However, he did not say how a tableau in place of contingent reduced time.",
