So we were bound by the order,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Tuki insisted that the imposition of President\u2019s rule was uncalled for. \u201cThere is no point in imposing President\u2019s rule. It is an elected government and we have a majority.\u201d\n\nHe said the party would try its best to get out of the political quagmire and fight the Centre\u2019s decision legally.",
