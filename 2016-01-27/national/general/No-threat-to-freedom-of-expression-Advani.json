    "text": "BJP leader L.K. Advani on Tuesday said that there was \u201cno question mark on the freedom of expression in the country\u201d and wondered \u201cwho are the people saying so\u201d, in what is being considered as a rare instance of support for the Modi government. \u201cI do not know who are the people saying that there is no freedom of expression in India. This right (freedom of expression) has always been there. Such a question does not arise today,\u201d said Mr. Advani at a function at his residence to unfurl the national flag on Republic Day.\n\n\u201cPeople had fought against attempts to stifle freedom of expression during the British rule and during the Emergency, even our, Indian government had tried to do so, but people fought back.\u201d The remarks appear a little different from those made by him last year, when on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Emergency, he had said, \u201csuch a situation could exist today as well.\u201d At the time, that was taken as a criticism of the government.\n\n\u201cOn Republic Day, it is natural for a feeling of nationalism to be present all around, but efforts should be made to keep it alive all the time...,\u201d he said.",
