    "text": "Leader of the Opposition in Kerala V.S. Achuthanandan has written to Union Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju urging him to intervene to prevent the regularisation of high-rises on the flight path to the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Achuthanandan pointed out that the State Cabinet had decided to regularise the construction of buildings which had been built without obtaining a \u2018No Objection Certificate\u2019 from the Airports Authority of India (AAI).\n\nGiving occupancy certificates to the buildings in question would subvert the development possibilities of the Thiruvananthapuram international airport, he said.\n\nIn a statement here on Monday, Mr. Achuthanandan said the Oommen Chandy government had driven a nail on the airport\u2019s development potential by deciding to issue occupancy order to the buildings constructed in breach of AAI norms.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Ministry had issued a notification on January 14, 2010, stipulating that construction of buildings within 20 km radius of the airport should be subject to the Aircraft Act of 1934.\n\nThe AAI is authorised to demolish buildings constructed in violation of the provisions of the Act.\n\nHowever, the Cabinet decision to grant occupancy certificate was being made on the ground that the curbs under the Act had come into effect only after January 14, 2010, he pointed out.",
