But her coach believes she is a natural sprinter.\n\nOn Sunday, she sprinted to victory in the 100-metre dash at the Street Child Games held in Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. She also won two more medals. Nature or nurture, things had worked fine for her. But that was not how it was in the beginning.\n\nHepsiba, now 16, earlier lived with her widowed mother on Sydenhams Road near Chennai Central railway station. When they were evicted from the street, they were moved to a shelter for the homeless run by the Chennai Corporation. An unexpected opportunity that came her way finally took her to the international competition.\n\n\u201cWe had organised a sports contest for street children, and this girl was sheer talent,\u201d explains Paul Sunder Singh of Karunalaya, an NGO that took a team of five street children to Rio for the games.\n\nAfter training with coach Prabhakar Suresh for about two weeks, Hepsiba boarded her very first flight, one that would take her across the seas to Rio.\n\nThe team spent one and a half weeks there, interacting with street children from all over the world. Hepsiba says that she now has friends from Burundi, Pakistan, Egypt, Britain, Argentina and Brazil. That seems to her even larger than the win itself, which makes her \u201cvery, very, very happy\u201d.",
