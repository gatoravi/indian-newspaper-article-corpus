    "text": "An Indian entrepreneur has set up what is claimed to be the country\u2019s first gay marriage bureau, seeking to arrange matches for homosexual couples.\n\nBenhur Samson, who previously helped foreign gay couples use surrogacy services, said he founded the agency in response to interest from clients.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to see the response from the gay people whom I came in touch with while counselling them on surrogacy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is how I came upon the idea of a marriage bureau for gay men and women who want to settle down with a partner,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Samson, who lives in the United States, has enlisted the help of Manvendrasingh Gohil, an openly gay Indian prince, to help sort out immigration issues.\n\n\u201cSeveral gay people of Indian origin wanted an arranged marriage and were looking for partners from India,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe already got over 200 enquiries and nearly two dozen people have enrolled with us,\u201d Mr. Samson said.\n\nEnrolment costs $5,000, a high sum for most Indians, although the fee is refundable if no match is found. \u2014 AFP",
