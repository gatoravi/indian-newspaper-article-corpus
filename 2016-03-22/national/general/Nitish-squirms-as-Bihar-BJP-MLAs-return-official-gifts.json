    "text": "Two Bihar legislators on Monday returned gifts including microwave ovens, trolley bags and other items given by different departments of the State government during the ongoing budget session of the Bihar legislature. The move has sparked a strong reaction from former chief minister and RJD leader Rabri Devi and her son Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav, who said the BJP leaders were \u201cplaying politics\u201d over the issue and dared them to return all gifts they had received over several years.\n\nEarlier, after media reports last week that Bihar\u2019s legislators were being deluged with gifts, senior state BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said he and other party legislators would return the gifts to the government. On Monday, two of them did so.\n\nMr Modi returned all seven gift items, including a microwave oven, at the Legislative Council counter and he also shot off a letter to the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar requesting him to stop this tradition of giving expensive gifts to the members of state legislator every year during the budget session and that \u201cmoney should be spent on the development of the State\u201d.\n\nSources close to the Chief Minister later told The Hindu that he was unhappy over the political controversy on the issue and is said to have decided to do away with this practice. Meanwhile, the RJD leader and former state chief minister Rabri Devi and her son Deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav have slammed the BJP leaders for \u201cplaying politics\u201d over returning their gifts to the government.",
