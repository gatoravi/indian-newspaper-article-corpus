Protesting against anything which we find derogatory is our right. Also this is not the first time that copies of that book have been burnt by us,\u201d one of the students said in his response. Varsity sources said at least two other students have filed similar replies to the notice.\n\nThe students have also pointed out that the notices do not mention the \u201coffence\u201d for which they have been asked to give an explanation.\n\nAlmost a month after a controversial event organised against the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru was reported from the university, five ABVP rebels, joined by Left-backed All India Students Association (AISA) and Congress-affiliated National Students Union of India (NSUI) burnt sections of Manusmriti text at Sabarmati Dhaba, which was also the venue of the earlier event.\n\nThe JNU administration had issued notices to five students asking them to explain their \u201cposition\u201d.",
