The main attraction, a simulated broom ride, proved a little too rambunctious, leaving entire families with motion sickness. At one point, the line to get into Hogsmeade village was nine hours long.\n\nNow comes the cross-country expansion. Universal Studios Hollywood will unveil its own Wizarding World on April 7. Although the Potter movie series ended in 2011 calling into question continuing interest in the boy wizard, analysts expect the Hollywood park\u2019s overall attendance to increase immediately by more than 20 per cent.\n\nUniversal has introduced a demand-based ticket pricing system aimed at preventing overcrowding. And it has tweaked the Hogsmeade blueprints to add capacity. The broom ride \u2014 this time in 3-D \u2014 is still making some people vomit, though. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
