Jacob John, chairman of the New Delhi-based Child Health Foundation.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu from Vellore on Monday, Dr. John, who established the pulse polio immunisation three decades ago, said India must declare tuberculosis as a health emergency and tackle the disease on a war-footing. Failure to do so would make it an uncontrollable disease in the next three to five years.\n\nTackling tuberculosis has to go beyond the realm of treatment and move to controlling it, Dr. John added.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, the number of cases in India and China were on a par. But China has brought down the numbers quite remarkably,\u201d he said. China\u2019s tuberculosis burden has gone down by half \u2013 the overall prevalence rate per 100,000 population dropping from 215 in 1990, to 108 in 2010.\n\nThe rate of decline was 2.2 per cent a year between 1990 and 2000, and 4.7 per cent a year between 2000 and 2010, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nIndia accounts for an estimated 2.2 million of the 8.6 million new TB cases that occur each year globally, and harbours more than double the cases as any other country, according to WHO.\n\nDr. John stressed that the focus on treating TB alone cannot control the disease. \u201cYou need additional intervention, and an efficiently-run primary and secondary healthcare system, which we don\u2019t have in India,\u201d he said.",
