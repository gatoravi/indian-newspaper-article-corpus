Mr Singh said it was unfortunate that the BCCI was opposing these recommendations.\n\nMr Singh said the HPCA that had not respected the feelings of martyrs\u2019 families by inviting the Pakistan cricket team to Dharamsala, was just a money-making organisation.\n\nKnowing that the government\u2019s move has gone against him politically by using the martyrs\u2019 name, the octogenarian Chief Minister has now come out openly against the cricket association, since it is headed by his arch political rivals, the Dhumal family. Anurag Thakur, Loksabha MP and Arun Dhumal, sons of former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal are the office bearers of HPCA.\n\nMr. Anurag Thakur is also the BCCI secretary.",
