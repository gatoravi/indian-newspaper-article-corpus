    "text": "Entering the poll ring again after the debacle in Bihar, the BJP seems to have learnt its lessons, at least when it comes to deploying its most important campaign asset \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nFor Assam, the only State where the BJP fancies its chances among the four States and one Union territory going to the polls, the BJP has scheduled only six public meetings of Mr. Modi till now. This is in stark contrast to his 40 rallies in Bihar.\n\nTop sources in the BJP said the PM\u2019s programme would also involve an overnight stay at Jorhat. \u201cOn March 26, he will address four rallies \u2014 in Tinsukia, Bihpura, Majuli [the party\u2019s chief ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal\u2019s seat] and Borakhat,\u201d said a senior party office-bearer.\n\nIn West Bengal too, only six rallies are planned. \u201cWe let the Bihar campaign be about everything other than Bihar. We will not make that mistake in Assam,\u201d said the source.",
