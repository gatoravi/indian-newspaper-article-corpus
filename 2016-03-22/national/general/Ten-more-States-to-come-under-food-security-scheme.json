We have worked towards sorting out the issues and now more and more States are joining,\u201d Mr. Paswan said.\n\nIn the last two years, the Centre and the States have worked for digitization, linking ration cards with Aadhaar, computerization of PDS shops and supply chain network, which are required to implement the act nationally.\n\n\u201cOf the 24.18 crore ration cards in the country, almost 99 per cent have been digitized while 48 per cent have been linked with Aadhaar cards,\u201d the Minister said.",
