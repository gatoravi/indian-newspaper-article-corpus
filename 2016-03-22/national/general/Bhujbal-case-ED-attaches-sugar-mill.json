    "text": "ED officials said the mill was among the several properties under the scanner for several months during its probe into the alleged irregularities in the construction of the Maharashtra Sadan guesthouse in New Delhi and the Kalina land grabbing case.\n\n\u201cMr. Bhujbal\u2019s arrest and subsequent interrogation helped us establish the link of the property to the tainted money. We confirmed the same with Sameer when we brought him for questioning last week. Neither of them was able to provide satisfactory explanations as to how the funds required for the purchase of the mill were raised,\u201d said another officer.\n\nThe agency has alleged that the illegal gratification and bribe money collected by the Bhujbal family in kickbacks during the senior NCP leader\u2019s tenure as Public Works Department Minister was used in the form of share application money by two companies, Parvesh Constructions Private Ltd and Armstrong Energy Private Ltd.\n\nThe funds were subsequently laundered and channelled to Armstrong Infrastructure and thereafter invested in the Girna Sugar Mill, said sources.\n\nThe sugar mill, which had been shut since 1995, was acquired by Armstrong Infrastructure through auction proceedings from the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for over Rs.27.82 crore in 2013. Farmers and activists in the area had at the time alleged that the mill was undervalued before being sold to the Bhujbals.\n\nApart from a bank loan of Rs.10 crore, the remaining amount was paid allegedly using funds received from Armstrong Energy Private Ltd and Parvesh Construction Private Ltd.\n\n\u201cThis rendered Girna Sugar Mill a tainted asset. Therefore, the property has been attached, pending confirmation from the adjudicating authority,\u201d the official said.",
