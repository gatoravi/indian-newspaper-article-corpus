    "text": "The passengers of an Air India (AI) Kolkata-Delhi flight (AI 701) had a harrowing time after it was delayed by 13 hours, finally landing at Delhi airport on Monday instead of Sunday.\n\nThe problem was found to be a technical snag in a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft of the Air India fleet that befuddled its technicians, who took a long time to rectify it.\n\nThe ordeal began for the 236 passengers on board, which included CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, when the aircraft started taxiing for take-off at the Kolkata airport on Sunday around 5.30 p.m. A technical snag was detected in the aircraft that could not be rectified by airline engineers on Sunday.\n\nBy the time the aircraft was fit to fly, one of the pilots had exhausted his Flight Time Duty Limitations (FDTL).\n\n\u2018Took all measures\u2019\n\nWhile several passengers complained that the airline had kept them in the dark, Air India said it had taken all measures to keep the passengers comfortable, despite the technical glitch that held the flight back. \u201cSince the flight was delayed, I de-boarded and left for the party office in Kolkata. I had dinner there, and after taking some rest came back to airport to catch the morning flight today [Monday],\u201d Mr. Yechury said.\n\nAn AI spokesperson said the snag was rectified after several attempts to operate the flight, however at 10.10 p.m., the aircraft was grounded and the flight was cancelled.\n\n\u201cArrangements were made to take care of the 236 passengers. Refreshments were served on board,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said all passengers were given an option for hotel accommodation and food. \u201cWhile some passengers opted for hotel stay, others especially from Kolkata, went back home. For them transport reimbursement was made,\u201d he said.\n\nThe airline said it had made all possible efforts to arrange for an alternate aircraft to fly the remaining 131 passengers who stayed behind, but by the time boarding completed, one of the pilots crossed the FDTL and the aircraft could not be flown.\n\nAlternate pilots\n\n\u201cSome passengers decided to stay inside the aircraft till it departed at 6.30 a.m. on Monday with an alternate set of pilots. These passengers were also served dinner on board and the AC was kept on for their comfort. Passengers who had stayed in hotel or their home, also boarded the flight in the morning and 182 passengers came by the flight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAir India is continuously taking steps to minimise such incidents. However, Air India often face technical glitches in Dreamliner aircraft. The same is being addressed with the manufacturer M/s Boeing on a regular basis,\u201d he said.\n\nAn AI official claims all passengers\n\nwere given an option for hotel accommodation",
