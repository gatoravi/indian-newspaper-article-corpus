    "text": "In a first, researchers have shown that a fungus can transform manganese into a mineral composite with favourable electrochemical properties \u2014 paving the way for a better rechargeable battery in the near future.\n\nThe findings suggest that fungus Neurospora crassa , which is present in a red bread mould, could be the key to producing more sustainable electrochemical materials for use in rechargeable batteries\n\n\u201cWe have made electrochemically active materials using a fungal manganese biomineralisation process,\u201d said Geoffrey Gadd from the University of Dundee in Scotland.\n\nThe electrochemical properties of the carbonised fungal biomass-mineral composite were tested in a supercapacitor and a lithium-ion battery. \u2014 IANS",
