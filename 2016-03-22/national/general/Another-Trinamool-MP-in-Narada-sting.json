    "text": "Fresh videos of the Narada News sting operation uploaded on the portal\u2019s website on Monday show another Trinamool Congress MP allegedly accepting cash on camera.\n\nThe youngest MP of the party, Aparupa Poddar, is seen apparently accepting wads of currency from a person who introduced himself as a representative of a fictitious company. She is seen making a phone call to her aide asking him to bring her \u201cthe black purse.\u201d\n\nMs. Poddar was elected to Lok Sabha from the Arambagh Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal Bardhaman district.\n\nIn another video, Sankhudeb Panda, the former head of the party\u2019s student wing, is heard demanding a \u201cstake\u201d in the fictitious company. \u201cI want a stake\u2026 I have no profession now. But if I have to be in politics in future, then I must do something,\u201d Mr. Panda is heard saying.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Panda is credited with having carried out a sting on the former Communist Party of India (CPI) MLA from Nandigram, Ilias Mohammed, in 2007. Mr Panda, who was then working for a local television channel, had posed as an NGO worker and handed over cash to the MLA.\n\nReacting to the video, Ms. Poddar said the matter must be probed. If found guilty, she would resign as MP within seven days, she said.\n\nThe development comes a week after Narada News created a furore in the poll-bound State when it caught several senior Trinamool Congress leaders on camera apparently accepting cash.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress described the development as a \u201cpolitical conspiracy\u201d and \u201csmear campaign.\u201d\n\nThe State leadership of BJP held a press conference where it played the videos. The party said it would once again approach the Election Commission.",
