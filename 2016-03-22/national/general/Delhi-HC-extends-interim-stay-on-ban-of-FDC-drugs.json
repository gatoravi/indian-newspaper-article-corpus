    "text": "In a relief to the pharmaceutical companies, the Delhi High Court on Monday extended the interim stay on the Union government's decision to ban some Fixed Drug Combination (FDC) medicines till the next hearing on March 28. The government said in an affidavit that lifting the ban would be \u201cagainst public interest\u201d.\n\nThe High Court had last week stayed the operation of the Centre's ban on FDC drugs of about 30 pharma companies after initially giving interim relief on March 14 to Pfizer's cough syrup, \u201cCorex\u201d. Companies such as Cipla, Procter & Gamble, Lupin, Piramal and Glenmark have obtained relief from the court.\n\nExpert panel findings\n\nThe Union government had banned the FDCs on March 10 based on the findings of an expert panel that these medicines lacked therapeutic effects and posed health risks to the patients. The drug companies termed the government's decision arbitrary and moved the court seeking its revocation.\n\nThe Bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw on Monday listed all the matters challenging the government's ban for hearing on March 28 and said the interim restraint order would continue till that date, when the drug makers would be heard.\n\nIn their petitions moved in the court, the companies contended that the Centre's March 10 notification banning over 300 FDC medicines was issued without issuing them a show cause notice or hearing them.",
