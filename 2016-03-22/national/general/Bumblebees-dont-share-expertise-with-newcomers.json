    "text": "Bumblebees do not like sharing their pollinating knowledge with less experienced bees, and even attack newcomers in the field, researchers from Queen Mary University of London report.\n\nA study looked at whether bees can copy other bees\u2019 flower visitation sequences to improve their foraging.\n\n\u201cLike other pollinators, bees face complex routing challenges when collecting nectar and pollen. They have to learn how to link patches of flowers together in the most efficient way to minimise their travel distance and flight costs,\u201d explained lead author Mathieu Lihoreau. But experienced bees tried to evict newcomers. The findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE . \u2014 IANS",
