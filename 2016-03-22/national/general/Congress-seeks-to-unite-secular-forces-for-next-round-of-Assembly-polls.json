    "text": "The Congress is looking to unite secular forces in the next round of elections to Assemblies of four States and the Union Territory of Puducherry.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference here on Monday, Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge said that the Bharatiya Janata Party has no base in the four States, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, and Puducherry, which are scheduled to go to polls in April and May this year.\n\nThe Congress leader, who is also the chairperson of the screening committee for selection of candidates for Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Puducherry, said that the committee is scheduled to meet later this month.\n\nMr. Kharge also criticised the BJP for destabilising Congress-led State governments.\n\nAfter bringing down the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP, which does not have the people\u2019s mandate, is now resorting to manipulation of the elected representatives in Uttarakhand, Mr. Kharge alleged. Terming the BJP\u2019s efforts as \u201cmurder of democracy\u201d, Mr. Kharge claimed that it was \u201cintoxicated with power\u201d.\n\nThe Congress leader said the ruling BJP does not want to have an Opposition party. \u201cIt is not possible in India, where the people have faith in the Constitution and secularism,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kharge strongly criticised senior BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu\u2019s description of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as \u201cGod\u2019s gift for India\u201d and \u201cmessiah of the poor\u201d.\n\nWest Bengal, TN, Kerala, Assam, and Puducherry are scheduled to go\n\nto polls",
