    "text": "Days before an investigation team from Pakistan comes to India to probe the Pathankot terror attack, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) released the photographs of four terrorists killed during the encounter, which began on January 2 and lasted for more than 40 hours. The photographs were created by roping in a professional laboratory in Mumbai.\n\nThe NIA's press release featured the bodies of the four slain terrorists with description of their height. The anti-terror probe agency has said one of the terrorists did not have a toe in both feet.\n\nThe pictures have been circulated and public asked to share information about the suspects.\n\nThe agency has already approached the Interpol for issuing a Black Notice for the four. The international notice is issued for identification of unidentified bodies found in a country.\n\n\u201cThese men don\u2019t belong to India and we have done investigations on that front. We have released the pictures so that people in neighbouring country could also provide us with details and leads. We are still preserving the bodies,\u201d said a senior NIA official.\n\nAbout the remaining two, the NIA was planning to approach another forensic laboratory for conducting a fresh test of the samples recovered from the Airmen billet at the Pathankot air base. The identity of the other two would take time, an official said.\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) from Pakistan will be arriving here on March 27.",
