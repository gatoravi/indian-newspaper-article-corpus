    "text": "While the Congress and the Left parties have been able to forge an understanding on 95 per cent of the Assembly seats, certain \u201cpsychological barriers\u201d remain, West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has said. \u201cThough workers of both parties wanted the alliance, we have to understand that for 34 years, we have been diametrically opposed to each other. Some psychological barriers still remain which need to sorted out,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nOn their differences on certain seats, the State Congress president said the issue was not with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) but with their allies.\n\n\u201cThe allies of the CPI(M) think that after the alliance, their very existence will be at stake. For me, the Left Front is the CPI(M)-led Left Front. We have been able to accommodate our allies, the JD(U) and RJD, and accordingly the CPI(M) will have to accommodate them... it is not our responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chowdhury said the alliance was \u201cnot an option but a necessity\u201d and it was \u201csheer desperation\u201d that brought both parties together. He said that if the Left Front and the Congress had not come together in the polls, the \u201copposition would be obliterated from the soil of Bengal lock, stock and barrel.\u201d\n\n\u2018We were able to accommodate our allies, the CPI(M) too should do so\u2019",
