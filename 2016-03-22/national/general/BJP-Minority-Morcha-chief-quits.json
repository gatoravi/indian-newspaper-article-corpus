Mr. Ansari said he was contemplating joining the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).\n\n\u201cI am in talks with the TMC leadership. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has done a lot for the development of Muslims,\u201d he told Th e Hindu , pointing out that the TMC had fielded 57 Muslim candidates of the total 294 seats.\n\n\u201cThe State BJP president [Dilip Ghosh] told me that he could not field Muslim candidates due to RSS pressure,\u201d he said.
