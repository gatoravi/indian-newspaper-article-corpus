The presence of westerlies, which bring hot, dry winds from the land \u2014 something unusual for this time of the year \u2014 has contributed to the blazing heat, Met officials say.\n\nHowever, experts say there is a possibility of showers in southern Tamil Nadu by the end of this month.\n\nThough the change in wind pattern from cool easterlies to westerlies occurs only in April, such brief episodes do happen in March too, observe weather experts.\n\nY. E. A. Raj, former deputy director general of meteorology, noted that increase in temperature levels also depends on the length of day time and the angle of sun rays during March.\n\nThe Meteorological Department predicts that the same dry weather pattern will continue for two more days.",
