    "text": "Temperatures at the North Pole rose above freezing point on Wednesday, 20 degrees Celsius above the mid-winter norm and the latest abnormality in a season of extreme weather events.\n\nCanadian weather authorities blamed the temperature spike on the freak depression which has already brought record Christmas temperatures to North America and lashed Britain with winds and floods.\n\nThe deep low pressure area is currently looming over Iceland and churning up hurricane force 75-knot winds and 30-foot waves in the north Atlantic while dragging warm air northwards.\n\n\u201cIt's a very violent and extremely powerful depression, so it's not surprising that hot temperatures have been pushed so far north,\u201d said Canadian government meteorologist Nathalie Hasell.\n\n\u201cThis deep depression has pushed hot air as far as the North Pole, where temperatures are at least 20 degrees above normal, at around freezing point, between zero and two degrees,\u201d she said.\n\nAn Arctic monitoring point 180 miles (300 km) from the Pole that had been recording minus 37 degrees on Monday had shot up to minus eight by Wednesday, said senior researcher James Morison.\n\nThe polar region is the area of the world that has seen the most profound effects of climate change in recent decades. Average year-round temperatures in the Arctic are three degrees Celsius higher than they were in the pre-industrial era, snowfall is heavier, winds are stronger and the ice sheet has been shrinking for 30 years. It may be too hasty to pin this week's extreme weather directly on the man-made climate change phenomenon, rather than on a discreet anomaly, scientists said. \u2014 AFP",
