Sudheendra.\n\nThe film was supposed to be released on November 15 to mark the 15{+t}{+h}anniversary of the release of Dr. Rajkumar, who was held captive by Veerappan.\n\nHowever, it did not materialise because Muthulakshmi, wife of slain poacher, took exception to the film\u2019s release. Later a Chennai-based producer went to court opposing the release. Finally, the decks were cleared, with Karnataka High Court dismissing the appeal. \u201cThe Kannada and Telugu versions will hit screens on Friday. Tamil audience will have to wait till February and northern belt has to wait till March to watch the film,\u201d said Mr. Sudheendra.
