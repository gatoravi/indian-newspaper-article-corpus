    "text": "Food items served in the Parliament canteen will be dearer from Friday, with rates being revised in varying degrees in the wake of controversies over hugely subsidised costs of eatables in times of ballooning prices.\n\nWith the canteen working on \u2018no-profit, no-loss\u2019 basis, a veg platter which earlier cost Rs.18 will now be sold for Rs. 30 and non-veg thali will cost Rs. 60 instead of Rs. 33 earlier.\n\nA three-course meal will cost Rs. 90 instead of Rs. 61 earlier and chicken curry, which earlier cost Rs. 29, will be sold for Rs. 40. The number of items hitherto prepared in the canteen will be reduced to one-fifth to avoid wastage and cut cost. Also, tea and coffee vending machines will be placed to reduce the burden on manpower. \u2014 PTI",
