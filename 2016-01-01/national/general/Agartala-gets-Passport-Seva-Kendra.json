(retd.) V.K. Singh, however, failed to turn up for the inauguration. State Information and Finance Minister Bhanulal Saha filled in for him.\n\nThe successive governments in the State had demanded a passport office because applications were processed in the Kolkata regional passport office.\n\nThe troubles increased after the handwritten passport was prohibited and machine-readable passport was made compulsory in November last.",
