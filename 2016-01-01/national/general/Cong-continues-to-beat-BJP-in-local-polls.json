    "text": "The Congress seemed to be continuing with the trend of doing well in local polls, especially in the BJP-ruled States, as it won eight out of 11 seats in the civic polls in Chhattisgarh, the results of which were declared on Thursday.\n\nCompared to the previous polls in which the BJP had won seven out of 11 seats, this time the party managed to hold on to only three seats. This year, the Congress has shown some signs of recovery after facing a serious defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe rejuvenation, party leaders feel, is stemming from the municipality level as in the last few months the party has performed well in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and now in Chhattisgarh.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the spree of victories signifies that the people are mature when it comes to making political choices. \u201cIt also might be a voter signal that \u2018don\u2019t take us for granted\u2019,\u201d says a Delhi-based sociologist Shiv Visvanathan.\n\nB.K. Hari Prasad, the Congress general secretary for Chhattisgrah, told The Hindu that the alleged PDS scam in the State created a dent in the BJP\u2019s public image.",
