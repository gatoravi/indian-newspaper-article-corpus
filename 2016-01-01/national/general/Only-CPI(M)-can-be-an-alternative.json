We have to be steeled as communists to fight the deviations inside our party and, in doing so, the only weapon we have is party unity.\u201d\n\nIn his short speech replete with quotes from left-wing intellectual Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Vietnamese Communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh, Mr. Yechury said it was only the CPI(M) that could offer a \u201cpolicy alternative, a better political culture that fights corruption, moral degradation and degeneration, which is rampant in Indian politics today.\u201d A document highlighting the decisions of the plenum stated that it was the \u201chistoric responsibility\u201d of the CPI(M) that it must emerge as the \u201cvanguard of the people\u2019s upsurge\u201d.\n\nMr. Yechury said the party had successfully completed the mandate of the 21st party congress by holding the plenum that had \u201cresulted in a more galvanised CPI(M).\u201d\n\nThe CPI(M) general secretary also urged party cadres to be prepared for the upcoming elections in four States, including West Bengal and Kerala, where they have to take the party\u2019s message to the people and also brave attacks by hostile forces.\n\nThe plenum unanimously adopted the Report on Organisation. The Resolution on Organisation also highlighted the need for inclusion of more women, youth and other sections unrepresented in the party. \u201cA total of 191 amendments and suggestions were received for the Draft Report on Organisation, of which 36 were accepted. There were 73 amendments and suggestions to the Draft Resolution on Organisation, of which six were accepted,\u201d a press release said.",
