In a first of its kind, the Jammu and Kashmir government has embarked on its biggest-ever initiative in the education sector by providing free coaching, including for professional exams, to more than one lakh students, who, otherwise, cannot afford the same.\n\nThe education department on Thursday opened numerous district-level schools for free coaching under the Super-50 Free Winter Tutorial programme. It comes in a State where schools remain closed for three months due to a harsh winter.\n\nInaugurating the initiative at Srinagar\u2019s Government Girls High School, Hyderpora, where 10th and 12th standard students will be provided free coaching with state-of-the-art facilities like Central Heating System and free Wi-Fi, State Education Minister Naeem Akhtar said, \u201cIt is Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed\u2019s dream to remove the restlessness in our hearts and minds and to revive the glorious academic culture in J&K that has left imprints across the globe.\u201d\n\nThe initiative is open for both government as well as private school students.",
