    "text": "Pulling up the Uttar Pradesh government for its sluggish progress in issuing soil health cards to farmers, the Centre has asked the State to speed up efforts to ensure that the benefits of the scheme reach the farmers in all districts.\n\nUnion Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has written a letter to U.P. chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, asking the State government to monitor the soil health cards scheme at the \u2018highest level\u2019 so that its best results could be realised in the interest of the farmers.\n\nNotably, a performance review of the scheme for various State governments revealed that U.P. has not been performing to its potential. As against a target of 18 lakh samples till 9 December, 2015, only 4.68 lakh samples have been collected across the State and only 22,894 samples analysed.\n\nWhen the scheme was announced in February 19, 2015, the idea was that soil samples from 47.7 lakh farmers would be collected over a period of three years and soil health cards issued to them after tests. However, on September 10, the Centre decided that this \u201cimportant task\u201d should be completed in two years instead of three.\n\nAccordingly, the Centre made a request to the U.P. government through letters dated September 14th and 17th to increase the target of issuing soil health cards in 2015-16 from 15.9 lakhs to 18 lakhs. Moreover, the target for U.P. for 2016-17 was raised from 15.9 lakhs to 29.7 lakhs.\n\n\u201cThe Centre has been emphasising on improving soil health by integrated nutrient management and had announced a programme to collect soil samples, conduct analyses and issue soil health cards in a time-bound manner,\u201d Mr.Singh wrote in the letter.",
