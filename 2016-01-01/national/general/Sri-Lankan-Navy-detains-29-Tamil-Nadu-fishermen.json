    "text": "They are likely to be produced before a court on Friday\n\nThe Sri Lankan Navy on Wednesday detained 29 fishermen of Akkaraipettai in Nagapattinam district on the charge of trespassing into the Sri Lankan waters.\n\nThey had ventured into the sea for fishing on December 27 on three mechanised boats. While eleven fishermen were on board of a boat, nine fishermen were on board in each of the other two boats.\n\nThey were supposed to return to the shore on Thursday.\n\nAccording to information available with the Department of Fisheries and fishermen associations here, the Sri Lankan Naval personnel, who came close to the area where they were fishing, detained all of them when they were getting ready to return to the shore.\n\nThey were all taken to an army camp in Trincomalee and then to a police station. After medical examinations, they are likely to be produced before a court on Friday. The arrest has evoked strong reaction from the fishermen associations and NGOs working for the release of fishermen.\n\nU. Arulanandam, founder, Alliance for the Release of Innocent Fishermen, ARIF, said that it was unfortunate that the fishermen had been arrested on the eve of New Year.\n\nDemanding the immediate intervention of the State and Central governments for securing the release of all fishermen in Lankan jails, he said action should also be taken to bring back 71 fishing boats from Sri Lankan custody.\n\n'It is unfortunate that they have been arrested on the eve\n\nof New Year'",
