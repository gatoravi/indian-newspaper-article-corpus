    "text": "Although the day when every household has its own robot is some way off, the Japanese are demonstrating a formidable acceptance of humanoids\n\nErica enjoys the theatre and animated films, would like to visit South-East Asia, and believes her ideal partner is a man with whom she can chat easily.\n\nShe is less forthcoming, though, when asked her age. \u201cThat\u2019s a slightly rude question\u2026 I\u2019d rather not say,\u201d comes the answer. As her embarrassed questioner shifts sideways and struggles to put the conversation on a friendlier footing, Erica turns her head, her eyes following his every move.\n\nIt is all rather disconcerting, but if Japan\u2019s new generation of intelligent robots is ever going to rival humans as conversation partners, perhaps that is as it should be.\n\nErica, who, it turns out, is 23, is the most advanced humanoid yet to have come out of a collaborative effort between Osaka and Kyoto universities, and the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR).\n\nAt its heart is the group\u2019s leader, Hiroshi Ishiguro, a professor at Osaka University\u2019s Intelligent Robotics Laboratory, who is perhaps best known for creating Geminoid HI-1, an android in his own likeness, right down to his trademark black leather jacket and a Beatles mop-top made with his own hair.\n\nErica, however, looks and sounds far more realistic than Ishiguro\u2019s silicone doppelganger, or his previous human-like robot, Geminoid F. Though she is unable to walk independently, she possesses improved speech and an ability to understand and respond to questions, her every utterance accompanied by uncannily human-like changes in her facial expression.\n\nErica, Ishiguro insists, is the \u201cmost beautiful and intelligent\u201d android in the world.\n\n\u201cThe principle of beauty is captured in the average face, so I used images of 30 beautiful women, mixed up their features and used the average for each to design the nose, eyes, and so on,\u201d Ishiguro says, pacing up and down his office at ATR\u2019s robotics laboratory. \u201cThat means she should appeal to everyone.\u201d\n\nShe is a more advanced version of Geminoid F, another Ishiguro creation who this year appeared in Sayonara , director Koji Fukada\u2019s cinematic adaptation of a stage production of the same name.\n\nThe movie, set in rural Japan in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster, made Geminoid F the world\u2019s first humanoid film actor, co-starring opposite the human actor Bryerly Long. While robots in films are almost as old as cinema itself, Erica did not rely on human actors \u2014 think C-3PO \u2014 or the motion-capture technology behind, for example, Sonny from I, Robot . Although the day when every household has its own Erica is some way off, the Japanese have demonstrated a formidable acceptance of robots in their everyday lives over the past year.\n\nFrom April, two branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group started employing androids to deal with customer enquiries. Pepper, a humanoid home robot, went on sale to individual consumers in June, with each shipment selling out in under a minute.\n\nThis year also saw the return to Earth of Kirobo, a companion robot, from a stay on the International Space Station, during which it became the first robot to hold a conversation with a human in space.\n\nHotel staffed by robots\n\nAnd this summer, a hotel staffed almost entirely by robots \u2014 including the receptionists, concierges and cloakroom staff \u2014 opened at the Huis Ten Bosch theme park near Nagasaki, albeit with human colleagues on hand to deal with any teething problems.\n\nBut increasing daily interaction with robots has also thrown up ethical questions that have yet to be satisfactorily answered. SoftBank, the company behind Pepper, saw fit to include a clause in its user agreement stating that owners must not perform sexual acts or engage in \u201cother indecent behaviour\u201d with the android.\n\nIshiguro believes warnings of a dystopian future in which robots are exploited \u2014 or themselves become the abusers \u2014 are premature.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an ethical problem,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst we have to accept that robots are a part of our society and then develop a market for them. If we don\u2019t manage to do that, then there will be no point in having a conversation about ethics,\u201d he adds.\n\nNomura Research Institute offered a glimpse into the future with a recent report in which it predicted that nearly half of all jobs in Japan could be performed by robots by 2035.\n\n\u201cI think Nomura is on to something,\u201d says Ishiguro. \u201cThe Japanese population is expected to fall dramatically over the coming decades, yet people will still expect to enjoy the same standard of living.\u201d That, he believes, is where robots can step in.\n\nIn Erica, he senses an opportunity to challenge the common perception of robots as irrevocably alien. As a two-week experiment with android shop assistants at an Osaka department store suggested, people may soon come to trust them more than they do human beings.\n\n\u201cRobots are a mirror for better understanding ourselves,\u201d he says. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
