Mr. Modi accused the Congress of trying to \u201cdestroy Parliament\u201d while the Congress blamed him for exercising \u201cautocracy.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister launched his attack against the Congress at a public meeting in Western Uttar Pradesh where he laid the foundation for a 14-lane Delhi-Meerut Expressway.\n\n\u201cThose who have enjoyed power for 50-60 years, they have no right to destroy Parliament...to stop functioning of Parliament,\u201d said Mr. Modi, hinting at the Congress rule ever since India became independent.\n\nThe heated rhetoric from both sides implies that the coming year would be full of political wrangling over the contentious issues like the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill and the amendment to the Land Acquisition Act. Mr. Modi said the Congress should take an oath that it will allow Parliament to function in 2016.\n\nProjects in poll-bound U.P.\n\nThe government also announced road projects worth Rs. 55,000 crore for Uttar Pradesh. The announcement of the projects comes a year ahead of the U.P. polls.\n\nThe Prime Minister hailed the expressway project as a \u201chighway to development.\u201d At an estimated worth of Rs.7,500 crore, Mr. Modi said the project would employ thousands of people and also boost the purchasing power of the poor.\n\nHe said that from January 1 the government would abolish the interviews for class III and class IV employees; appointments would only be on merit.\n\nReacting to the Prime Minister\u2019s remarks, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said: \u201cWe believe the responsibility of running Parliament is that of the government and of championing people\u2019s issues is that of the Opposition.\u201d The Prime Minister was \u201cout of step with reality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Those who have enjoyed power for 50-60 years have no right to destroy Parliament\u2019",
