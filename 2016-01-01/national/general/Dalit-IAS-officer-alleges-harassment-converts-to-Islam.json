Mr. Salodia, who accused the Vasundhara Raje government of \u201cvictimising him on the basis of caste\u201d also converted to Islam on Thursday.\n\nIn a letter to Ms. Raje, Mr. Salodia wrote: \u201cFor the first time after Independence, myself, an IAS officer from the SC/ST category would have been appointed today [on Thursday] as Chief Secretary [of Rajasthan] on the basis of seniority.\u201d\n\nMr. Salodia, Chairman of the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC), alleged that the current Chief Secretary C.S. Rajan was given a three-month extension till March next year, to deny Mr. Salodia the opportunity to replace him as Rajasthan\u2019s Chief Secretary. He sought voluntary retirement as he \u201cdid not wish to work under a junior officer.\u201d Mr. Salodia, who converted to Islam on Thursday, told that he believed in the equality that Islam, unlike Hinduism which discriminates on the basis of caste, offered to all its followers. \u201cAfter conversion, my name is Umrao Khan,\u201d he said.\n\nBaseless charge: Minister\n\nRajasthan Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Rathore dismissed Mr. Salodia\u2019s allegations. Addressing the media on Thursday, Mr. Rathore said Mr. Salodia had acted in violation of the law as he spoke against the government.\n\n\u201cMr. Salodia\u2019s allegations are baseless. Had the government discriminated on the basis of caste, Rajasthan Assembly Speaker [Kailash Meghwal] of the SC/ST community would not be in that post.\u201d",
