    "text": "Even after the much-discussed \u201cleaked tapes\u201d of purported conversations with the relatives of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh to \u201cfix\u201d a by-election last year, senior Congress leader Ajit Jogi remains the most popular politician in the State even as Mr.Singh continues to be the most powerful leader in the ruling BJP.\n\nMore than a year and a half before the alleged tapes surfaced, many senior Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh had blamed the Jogis for Congress candidate Manturam Pawar\u2019s last-minute withdrawal from Antagad assembly byelection in August, 2014.\n\nThe Jogis have always denied the allegations of a \u201chidden alliance,\u201d but the family remains sidelined in the State Congress unit and it accuses the party of practicing \u2018Anybody but Jogi\u2019 policy.\n\nAccording to some Congress sources, the party\u2019s central leadership was already in the know of the tapes.\n\nAn officer-bearer of the State unit went on to allege that the \u201ctapes\u201d may have been \u201cleaked\u201d at the behest of the central leadership to corner the Jogis as \u201cRahul Gandhi is not very comfortable with Ajit Jogi\u2019s ways\u201d.\n\nExpulsion threats\n\nHowever, the Jogi group is familiar with the threats of \u201cexpulsion\u201d from the party. But after every trip to New Delhi, the Jogis manage to \u201cextract\u201d what they want from the central leadership.\n\nThe leaked tapes seem to have rung more alarm bells in the CM\u2019s house than in the Congress as it also features Raman Singh\u2019s son-in-law Puneet Gupta.\n\n\u201cIf the tapes are authentic, then the big question to ask is who dared to tap the phones of the chief minister\u2019s relatives.\n\nBut the tape saga would not leave a big impact on Raman Singh\u2019s politics unless and until the central leadership of the BJP takes the issue seriously.\n\nAction ruled out\n\nThe action against the CM is ruled out as the BJP does not really have many options in the State, with most of the leaders and even cabinet ministers embroiled in a series of controversies,\u201d said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity.\n\nAn election observer, who spoke to The Hindu on the condition of anonymity, said the leaked tapes will not have much impact unless and until the central leadership of both the parties decide to act.",
