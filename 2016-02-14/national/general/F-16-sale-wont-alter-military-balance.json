The U.S. is still pitching the aircraft for the Indian Air Force under the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative.\n\nThe Defence Security Cooperation Agency, which coordinates foreign arms sales, said: \u201cThe proposed sale improves Pakistan\u2019s capability to meet current and future security threats\u201d and the fighter jets are specifically meant to \u201cenhance Pakistan\u2019s ability to conduct counter-insurgency and counterterrorism operations\u201d.\n\nThe sale of the aircraft to Pakistan, a major cold war ally of the U.S. in South Asia, is not new. It dates back to 1982 when the Reagan administration sold the first batch of aircraft when General Zia-ul Haq was the military ruler.\n\nForty fighter jets were transferred when the Pressler amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act stalled further sales because of concerns over Pakistan\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.\n\nHowever, after the 9/11 terror attacks in the U.S. and Pakistan emerged as the number one ally in the war on terror, the sales resumed. A deal for 18 F-16 Block C/D aircraft was signed in 2006 with an option for more.\n\nThe US also gave 14 used F-16 aircraft free of cost in 2012. In 2013, Pakistan announced its decision to buy 13 second-hand F-16 from Jordan, and the delivery started last year.\n\nCompared with the older version, the latest F-16 Block C/D is an entirely new aircraft with significant new capabilities.",
