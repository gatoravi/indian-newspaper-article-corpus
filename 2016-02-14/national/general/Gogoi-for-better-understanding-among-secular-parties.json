    "text": "The Assam Assembly elections are going to be closely fought between the Congress and the BJP. Tarun Gogoi, who won by a surprise handsome margin in his third term in 2011, says he knows the mantra of beating the anti-incumbency factor. He is hoping that the coming elections will be about Narendra Modi\u2019s 20-month rule at the Centre rather than his own decade-and-a-half rule in the State.\n\nIn an exclusive interview to The Hindu , he says: \u201cMr. Modi had said the moment he came to power that all infiltration would be finished, and Gogoi\u2019s red carpet to infiltrators would be rolled up. It has been 20 months since. Who has stopped him from honouring what he promised? Has he been able to do it? He has the intelligence services. If we had given shelter to infiltrators, he would have known it. On the borders, it is the central forces that are responsible for checking infiltration. If you check the performance of even NDA-I and compare it with the UPA\u2019s 10-year rule, our performance was much better.\u201d\n\nMr. Gogoi said he favoured a \u201c Maha understanding\u201d rather than a Bihar-style Mahagathbandhan in Assam. He included the CPI, the CPI(M), the All Assam Students Union and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in this loose grouping. However, he said he was unsure of AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal. \u201cI have a suspicion that he may have a secret understanding with the BJP,\u201d he said.",
