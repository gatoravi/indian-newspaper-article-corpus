They change the V-Cs and the new ones do what they wish. Be it Hyderabad University or JNU, an RSS agenda is being imposed,\u201d Mr. Yechury told the media.\n\n\u201cThey are branding JNU as anti-national. None will believe this. India\u2019s Foreign Secretary and former IB chiefs have been JNU alumni. Many IAS and IFS officers have studied at JNU.\u201d\n\n(With inputs from Jatin Anand & Kritika\n\nSharma Sebastian)",
