Even the Minister for Development of North East Region [DONER] is most helpless. He himself told me that he was entitled to Rs. 900 crore for his Ministry, but when he went to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, he was told: \u2018Whether this money remains in my kitty or your kitty is the same thing.\u2019 He admitted that he was fighting the anti-incumbency factor after three terms, and that was part of the reason for the focus of his campaign on the Modi government\u2019s 20-month rule. \u201cWhat the BJP is doing, inciting fears about outsiders, and the communal narrative, is important to tackle,\u201d he said.",
