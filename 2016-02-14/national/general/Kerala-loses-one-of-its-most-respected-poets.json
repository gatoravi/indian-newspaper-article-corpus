    "text": "Malayalam language and literature lost one of its most respected contemporary voices with the death of poet O.N.V. Kurup here on Saturday. He was 84.\n\nONV, as he was popularly known, died at a private hospital in the city at 4.35 p.m. following a cardiac arrest. He was admitted to the hospital with fever on Thursday and underwent angioplasty on Friday. His condition turned critical by noon and the end came soon thereafter. He had been keeping indifferent health for sometime now, but was quite active in the capital\u2019s social scene despite his ill-health, even putting in an appearance when Pakistani ghazal maestro performed in the city, braving serious illness.\n\nONV, whose poetic genius bloomed during the turbulent 1940s, grew up with the Left movement in Kerala. From the 1950s to his last breath, ONV was one of the key faces of Left intellectualism in the State, gaining an iconic status in the process.\n\nHe started out talking about the revolution and the indomitable spirit of the oppressed and dispossessed everywhere, but soon moved on to the intensely personal which also had universal dimensions, and still later moved to truly universal concerns, raising his voice against human depredation of the Earth\u2019s riches.\n\nThe nation honoured ONV with the Padma Shri in 1998 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2011. He won the Jnanpith Samman in 2007. His work Agnisalabhangal was chosen for the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1971 and Aksharam for the Kendrya Sahitya Akademi Award in 1975. The State honoured him with the Ezhuthachhan Puraskaram in 2007. He won the Soviet Land Nehru Award in 1981 for his collection of poems Uppu . The collection also won the Vayalar Rama Varma Literary Prize the next year. He was also honoured with Changampuzha Award, Asan Prize, Ulloor Prize and won the State government\u2019s award for the best lyricist a record 14 times, besides the national award. The Russian government honoured him with the Pushkin Prize recently.\n\nONV, a college teacher by profession, has to his credit such collections as Poruthunna Soundaryam , Mayilpeeli , Aksharam , Uppu , Karutha Pakshiyude Paatt , Karl Marxinte Kavithakal , Agnisalabhangal , Kothambumanikal , Bhoomikk oru Charamageetham , Mrigaya , and Veruthe , to name a few. He unsuccessfully contested as a Left-supported independent candidate in the 1989 Lok Sabha election.",
