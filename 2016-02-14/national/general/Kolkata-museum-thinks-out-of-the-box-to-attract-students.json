They come from private schools, government-aided schools, district schools and schools for special children.\n\nInstead of just taking them round the tall floors on the imposing heritage building, museum officials organise events which encourage the students to make clay models of the exhibits. A storyline is narrated to them to open up a bygone era before them. Recently, a small enclosure in the museum was utilised to recreate a model of a north-eastern State to narrate the history of tattoos there.\n\n\u201cIn this high-tech, digital age, with short concentration spans, museums cannot function as passive, laid-back repositories of heritage. The stories that we tell through our objects need to be more attractive, more interactive, and this is the idea that drives the workshops for children, who are perhaps the most important segment of our visitors\u201d, says Jayanta SenGupta, director of the museum.\n\nAlso popular are workshops where students are taught modelling and encouraged to recreate an exhibit. \u201cThis engages their mind and kindles an interest in them\u201c, says Sayan Bhattacharya, the museum\u2019s Education Officer.",
