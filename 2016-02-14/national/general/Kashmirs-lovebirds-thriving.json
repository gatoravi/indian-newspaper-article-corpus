Only a few pairs were sighted in the Ladakh region in 1980s but the number has now gone up to 95, the highest-ever recorded in a survey so far.\n\nAccording to the latest census by the State Department of Wildlife Protection, the bird population at 22 wetlands in Ladakh\u2019s high plateaus has gone up from 38 in 1997 to 95, including 14 breeding pairs.\n\n\u201cIn the past, only two wetlands were known in Ladakh where these birds were sighted. In 2013, a satellite-based telemetry study on black-necked cranes was carried out in Changthang Cold Desert Sanctuary and around 22 wetlands have been identified as their habitats now,\u201d Kargil Wildlife Warden, Intesar Suhail, told The Hindu .
