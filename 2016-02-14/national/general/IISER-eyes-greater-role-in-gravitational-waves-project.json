Atmjeet.\n\nScientists from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Thiruvananthapuram, who contributed to the historic discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, are gearing up for a greater role in the international project that promises to open a new window to the cosmos.\n\nThe Gravitational Wave Group at the School of Physics, IISER, Thiruvananthapuram, was part of the Indian Initiative in Gravitational-wave Observations (IndIGO) comprising scientists from nine institutions working under the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC).\n\nThe team, headed by Archana Pai, was involved in analysing the data from the gravitational wave detectors in the United States.\n\nThe group, which focusses on novel gravitational wave detection algorithms, directly contributed in testing general relativity with the black hole binary termed GW150914. With extensive computational analysis, the study found that the emitted signal is consistent with the predictions of general relativity.\n\nThe work is relevant now in the context of the discovery and with more advanced detectors scheduled to come up in the next few years, a press note issued by IISER said.\n\nThe current LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) network that detected gravitational waves, confirming the prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, consists of two U.S.-based detectors designed to detect tiny vibrations from passing gravitational waves.\n\nThe data from the detectors was analysed by an international team of scientists.",
