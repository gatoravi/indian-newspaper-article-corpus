However, they termed it \u201can apolitical affair\u201d. Local BJP leaders have shown no opposition to Ms. Mufti taking over as the next Chief Minister.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s central command in New Delhi has held several rounds of talks with the local BJP leaders and remains indecisive on how to reach out to the PDP without extending any concession beyond the alliance\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe two parties joined hands in March last year to form the government in the State after a fractured mandate.",
