Sanap here.\n\nBut after five days of deposition, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam could not extract any information on Abu Jundal from Headley. In fact, on Saturday, when tapes of recorded conversations of LeT handlers directing the 10 terrorists involved in the terror attack were played out before the court, Headley could not even recognise Abu Jundal\u2019s voice.\n\nHeadley, however, identified the voices of LeT handler Abu Kahaffa and Abu Al Kama and LeT commander Sajid Mir. Jundal is a key arrest for India in its effort to establish the complicity of Pakistan\u2019s involvement in funding terrorist organisations to carry out attacks in India.\n\nOn the last day of his examination-in-chief, Mr Nikam made Headley hear a voice recording that was played to him by Mir on a laptop. This was done to identify the voice.\n\nThe conversation between the handlers and terrorists on November 26, 2008 was carried out in Pakistani Punjabi with a few words of Urdu being used.\n\nThe first part of the recording started with a person greeting the other, \u201c Salaam Valekum and the other replying with \u201c Valekum Asalam .\u201d On being asked by the prosecutor to identify the voices, Headley said, \u201cThe quality of the audio is very poor.\u201d\n\nHe was then made to hear the other part, which had the lines, \u201c Saare Vaade Poore Karo, Jannat Bahut Khoobsurat Hain [Fulfil all your promises, heaven is very beautiful].\u201d Headley said it is either spoken by by Abu Khaffa or Abu Al Kama.\n\nThe other part of the same conversation had two voices, of which one was recognised as Mir\u2019s by Headley. Mir had said, \u201c Haanji Veer, Kya Haal Hain ?\u201d [Hey Veer, How are you?] He was then made to hear, \u201c Allah Aapka Kaam Kabool Karein [May God Accept Your Aspirations] Bahut Saare Logon Ke Zakham Par Marham Rakha Gaya Hain [Many people\u2019s grief must be avenged]. Jo Dua Aapko Batayi Thi Who Bhoolni Nahin Hain [Don\u2019 forget the prayers]. Jahaan Bhi Jao Dua Teen Baar Zaroor Padhna [Wherever you are, must recite the prayers three times].\u201d Headley recognised this voice to be that of Kahaffa.\n\nWhen the last part of the conversation was played, it ended with \u201c Jannat Inshallah Yahan Se Bahut Behtar Hain [Heaven, god willing, is much better].\u201d Headley said it had voices of three to four people whom he could not recognise. During the recording, one person informed the other about the death of the chief of the investigating agency. When Headley was asked to identify that voice, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand the content. The quality is very poor,\u201d and then said, \u201cIt sounded like Abu Al Kama\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\nNo questions were asked about Abu Jundal who was also appearing virtually in court through video conferencing after being lodged in Arthur Road Jail for being part of the conspiracy in the 26/11 attacks. The prosecutor did not even mention the name of Jundal or ask any question even remotely related to Jundal during the testimony of Headley and concluded his examination-in-chief.",
