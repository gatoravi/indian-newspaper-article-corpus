But one told AFP he was unsure if he could bear to go, even though he has tickets to see the American band.\n\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d said Guillaume Munier, who escaped the gunmen with a friend by hiding in a tiny upstairs toilet for two hours.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to at least go to the Olympia, but I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to go inside,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have the strength.\u201d\n\nAnother survivor, Helene, said she is not at all worried and hopes it will help bring her closure.\n\n\u201cIt will allow me to finish the concert,\u201d she said, referring to the fateful gig at the Bataclan on November 13. \u2014 AFP",
