He has not done anything wrong; so where is the question of apology,\u201d asked Jaishankar Singh, father of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students\u2019 Union president Kanhaiya Kumar who was arrested on sedition charge on Friday.\n\nHis mother, Meena Devi, said her son was politically inclined since his schooldays, \u201cbut has never ever said anything against the national interest.\u201d\n\nSitting on a charpoy in a room with the faded blue wall plaster peeling off at several places and a polythene bag full of medicines hung on a keel, Mr. Singh has been watching TV news since Friday morning. The couple lives in the ramshackle house at Maslanpur-Bihat, a village in Begusarai district of Bihar. A small-time farmer, Mr. Singh suffered a paralytic attack two years ago. Since then, he has been bed-ridden. Ms. Devi works as an anganwadi worker providing basic heath care in villages, earning Rs. 4,000 a month.\n\nMr. Singh said Communist Party of India (CPI) leader D. Raja called him up on Saturday and briefed him of a meeting party leaders had with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. \u201c Mera beta nirdosh hain \u2026 usne aisa kuch kiya hi nahi hai \u2026 usne galati ki hi nahi to maafi kis baat ki [My son is innocent\u2026when he has not done anything, why he should tender an apology],\u201d he asked in a chat with The Hindu on the phone.\n\nHe said his son was not seen in the video footage of students chanting anti-national slogans.\n\n\u201cMy son is a nationalist like hundreds of thousands of youths, but he follows the Left ideology. He is being victimised for opposing Hindutva politics,\u201d Ms. Devi said.",
