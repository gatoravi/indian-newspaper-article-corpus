Its appeal these days seems all but inescapable.\n\n\u2018Heroic and simple\u2019\n\n\u201cThere is something heroic to these men living in nature and dressing in a simple, natural, organic fashion,\u201d said Jacqueline West, the Oscar-nominated costume designer of The Revenant .\n\nAs Ms. West pointed out, it\u2019s hard at times to sort the characters in their woollens, badger and buffalo hides from the animals around them.\n\n\u201cThey are part of the natural world,\u201d she said. \u201cThey almost become the animals that they\u2019re hunting,\u201d their natural camouflage \u201cspeaking to a sense of preservation in us.\u201d\n\nA similar survivalist swagger materialised a year ago in the fall 2015 men\u2019s collections, the mood expressed in the outdoorsy, performance-wear of brands like Stone Island; Acronym, a German cult favourite; and White Mountaineering, a Japanese label, each built on so-called tactical dressing, showcasing tech and combat-derived looks made from high-performance materials with trade names like Polartec and Gore-Tex (think L.L. Bean parkas), complete with multiple tool pockets and heat-sealed seams.\n\nLast month, at the fall 2016 menswear shows, wild and woolly Western-inflected counterparts of that cushioned-and-quilted tech look were released on the European runways.\n\nBeefy shearling jackets and furs, buffalo plaids and Pendleton-style blankets muscled their way into shows like Dolce & Gabbana, where roughed-up curly lamb coats were offered, and Dries Van Noten and Burberry each issued husky man-furs atop outdoorsy plaid shirts or fleeces.\n\nLumberjack shirts\n\nWhite Mountaineering returned with a trapper-tinged collection called Trailblazer, and Coach celebrated doughty American archetypes like Kit Carson with a succession of patched leather jackets, lumberjack shirts, bandannas and bucket hats virtually bristling with flinty resourcefulness.\n\nAs the Coach handout stated, \u201cThe collection was about finding the heroic in everyday life.\u201d Not bulletproof by any stretch, the clothes were trend-resistant nonetheless. Pretty much as Stuart Vevers, the designer, intended. In The Revenant , as on the runway, the folksy, shredded but eminently durable look speaks volumes. Ms. West ascribed its resonance to a general appetite for simplicity and permanence that extends to people\u2019s wardrobes. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
