Mr. Xu is creating a library that catalogues the unique sounds that foods make as we eat.\n\nThe library is part of a software package that supports \u201cAutoDietary\u201d, a necklace being developed by Mr. Xu and researchers at Northeastern University in China.\n\n\u201cAutoDietary\u201d is like Fitbit and other wearable devices. Only instead of tracking burned calories, it monitors caloric intake \u2014 in other words, what we eat \u2014 at the neck. AutoDietary wraps around the back of the neck like a choker necklace.\n\nA tiny high-fidelity microphone \u2014 about the size of a zipper pull \u2014 records the sounds made during mastication and as the food is swallowed. That data is sent to a smartphone via Bluetooth where food types are recognised.\n\nThe study, published in the IEEE Sensors Journal , describes how 12 participants ages 13 to 49 were given water and six types of food: apples, carrots, potato chips, cookies, peanuts and walnuts.\n\n\u201cAutoDietary\u201d was able to accurately identify the correct food and drink 85 per cent of the time. Mr. Xu plans future studies to build upon his library by testing different foods and recording the sounds they make.\n\nHe also plans to refine the algorithms used to differentiate the foods to improve AutoDietary\u2019s ability to recognise what\u2019s being eaten.\n\nWhile promising, a wearable necklace that measures sound has limitations when used alone. For example, it cannot differentiate similar foods such as frosted corn flakes and regular corn flakes. It also can\u2019t distinguish the ingredients of complex foods such as soup or chilli.\n\nTo address these limitations, Mr. Xu is planning a biomonitoring device which would complement AutoDietary. The device is under development but it would be activated once the necklace recognises that the user is eating a general category of food. \u2014 IANS",
