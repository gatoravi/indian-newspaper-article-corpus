    "text": "An animal rights activist died after he consumed pesticide demanding that cow be declared national animal and Rashtra Mata (mother of the nation), in Rajkot, Gujarat. Seven other activists are under treatment.\n\nThe activists had come to the Rajkot Collector\u2019s office with hundreds of others. They declared that they were \u201csacrificing their lives to press their demand to make cow the national animal of the country and impose a nationwide ban on beef.\u201d\n\nHinda Bharwad died in civil hospital, Rajkot. \u201cThe others are stable,\u201d a senior government official told The Hindu .\n\nFollowing Bharwad\u2019s death, thousands of people, including priests of various temples, gathered at the hospital. Former Union Minister and chairman of the Gujarat Gau Seva Board Vallabh Kathiria was booed by the crowd and not allowed to see those under treatment.\n\nAnimal rights organisations and several other outfits have given a call for Rajkot bandh on Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of activists had submitted a memorandum to District Collector Manish Chandra. They apparently told the Collector that they would take the extreme step if their demand was not acted upon immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, they came with bottles of pesticide and sneaked into the Collector\u2019s office premises where, after brief slogan shouting, they consumed the poison. \u201cThey were rushed to the civil hospital immediately,\u201d said a senior police official from Rajkot.",
