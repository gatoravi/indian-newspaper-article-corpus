    "text": "It was a different government in West Bengal and a different sting operation.\n\nAt the height of the Nandigram movement, Ilias Mohammad, the local MLA of the Communist Party of India (CPI), was caught on camera accepting cash from a journalist posing as an NGO worker. Saugata Roy, a Trinamool Congress MLA then, moved a Privilege Motion in the Assembly. This led to the resignation of Mr. Mohammad.\n\nNine years later, Mr. Roy, now a Trinamool Congress MP, was seen allegedly taking cash in the Narada News sting.\n\nMr. Roy objects to the Speaker\u2019s decision referring the matter to the Ethics Committee of the House. He argued that it was a \u201cunilateral decision\u201d and if it became a practice, anybody would do a sting against members and an inquiry would have to be ordered into \u201cunverified\u201d contents.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu from his home, Mr. Mohammad was surprised that the Trinamool Congress leaders shown in the video had not resigned yet.\n\n\u201cAfter the Privilege Motion was moved in the Assembly, I had to resign. My political career came to an end,\u201d he said. A few years after the sting, he suffered a stroke.\n\nHis son, Sheikh Saddam Hossain, an active CPI worker in Nandigram, said it was difficult to live down this incident.\n\n\u201cThough he has got back his membership, the party has refused to give my father ticket, despite efforts by local members,\u201d he said.",
