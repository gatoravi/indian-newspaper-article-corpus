    "text": "Apart from the diplomatic pressure, Ford Foundation complied with the government\u2019s condition to register itself under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 which enables it to receive foreign funds in its accounts.\n\nFord Foundation, which has been operating in India since 1952 was not registered either as an NGO or under any other category like the Indian Society Act till now. It applied under FEMA and got registered as a branch office by the Reserve Bank of India in December 2015.\n\nBesides Ford Foundation, there are 15 other NGOs/associations, which are under this restricted category.\n\nU.S. ambassador Richard Verma had last year expressed \u201cconcern\u201d on the \u201cpotentially chilling effects\u201d of the regulatory steps taken against NGOs in India.\n\nThe Centre had last year also unblocked foreign funds to the tune of $1,50,000 to be released to the foreign donor\u2019s bank accounts as the organisation had exhausted its options to pay salary to its staffers and made a plea before the government.\n\nOn several occasions, Ford Foundation representatives met Nripendra Misra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister of India and explained their position.",
