    "text": "The panel was set up following unrest on campus in January\n\nA committee under the Information & Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry tasked to enquire into the unrest at the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) has made several recommendations, including a code of conduct that specifically bans political activity by students and teachers on the campus, and use of biometrics for keeping a tab on the attendance of professors. Another key recommendation was that a weekly report on lectures given to students be submitted to the secretary of the I&B Ministry.\n\nThe unrest followed derogatory remarks on a Facebook post on January 18 by an upper-caste student against Dalits at the institute. .\n\nThe panel recommendations have set off concerns on whether the IIMC will be a test-case for institutes of higher learning.",
