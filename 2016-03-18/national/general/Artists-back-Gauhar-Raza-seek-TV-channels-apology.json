    "text": "Writers, actors and artists came together on Thursday to demand an apology from Zee News for its vicious attack on renowned scientist, poet and filmmaker Gauhar Raza on its channel.\n\nAshok Vajpeyi, Naseeruddin Shah, Sharmila Tagore, Shubha Mudgal and Syeda Hameed joined others in lending their support to Mr. Raza.\n\nTheir letter of support comes in the wake of Mr. Raza\u2019s demand that the channel tender an apology and pay compensation of Rs.1 crore as damages for the intentional harm caused to him by the telecast. He also demanded that Zee remove all copies of the programme from all channels and social media and the Internet.\n\nThe letter drew the attention of the channel to the programme, Afzal Premi Gang Ka Mushaira , aired first on March 9, 2016. It said the programme was \u201cnot only false, motivated, defamatory, derogatory but also incendiary and telecast with a view to incite hatred, ill-will against Mr. Raza and cause public disorder\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe programme, framed in an aggressive, intimidating, and browbeating style, was telecast with commentary and taglines labelling Mr. Raza as anti-national,\u201d it said.\n\nZee News had telecast portions of poems recited by Mr. Raza on March 5, 2016 at the 51st Annual Shankar Shad Mushaira event in New Delhi. The mushaira is an annual event held with the objective of promoting poetry and was initiated in 1954.Three poems were recited by Mr. Raza at the event.\n\nIn the telecast, recitation of his poems was interspersed with video clips allegedly of slogans raised at the JNU on February 9, some of which were later found to be doctored by a forensic lab.\n\nThe letter cautioned Zee about violating the programme code, drawn by the News Broadcasters Association (NBA).",
