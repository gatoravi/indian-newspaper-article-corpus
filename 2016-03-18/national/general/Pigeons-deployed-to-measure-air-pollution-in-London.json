    "text": "Ten pigeons armed with air pollution detectors on their backs were released into the London sky on Wednesday to monitor pollution in the British capital.\n\nEquipped with GPS devices and pollution sensors to monitor nitrogen dioxide and ozone levels, the birds dubbed the \u2018Pigeon Air Patrol\u2019 were released from Primrose Hill, a wealthy area in north London.\n\nThe data they collect can be followed on the website pigeonairpatrol.com, said Romain Lacombe, founder of the French start-up Plume Labs, who started the project with Pierre Duquesnoy of DigitasLBi.\n\nThe pigeon patrol is part of a wider project by Plume Labs in which 100 Londoners equipped with detectors will monitor pollution in different parts of the capital which can be checked by fellow residents.\n\nAnyone wanting to take part can do so through a crowdfunding platform by buying a place for between \u00a379 and \u00a399. On Wednesday, 60 places were already taken.\n\nBritain\u2019s air pollution problem was the focus for tough questioning of Prime Minister David Cameron by opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in parliament on Wednesday.\n\nCorbyn cited data showing that 40,000 people die in Britain every year because of air pollution, which costs the British economy \u00a320 billion.\n\nA study by King\u2019s College last year said air pollution had contributed to the death of 9,500 Londoners.\n\nThe Labour leader said the truth was that 500,000 people would die from pollution before Britain manages to to reduce levels. \u2014 AFP",
