    "text": "The Haryana government has sent a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), rejecting the allegation of sexual assault on women near a \u2018dhaba\u2019 in Murthal during the Jat agitation last month, but has said that some women were \u201checkled.\u201d\n\nA senior government official said: \u201cThe report clearly stated that allegations of sexual harassment of women during last month\u2019s Jat agitation were incorrect.\u201d\n\nNo eyewitness or victim had come forward to lodge complaints.\n\nThe official said a cloth shop, located near the place of the purported incident, was looted. Since some reports said women\u2019s clothes were found in a field in Murthal, it was suggested that sexual assault had taken place.\n\nThe report said some women were \u201checkled\u201d during the Jat agitation but there was no conclusive evidence to suggest sexual assault.\n\nLarge-scale violence took place during the week-long Jat agitation, in which about 30 people were killed. The MHA rushed 30 companies of paramilitary forces for assisting the State police in maintaining law and order.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Home Minister Rajnath Singh and asked them to ensure adequate security measures as the deadline of Jat agitators ended on Thursday.",
