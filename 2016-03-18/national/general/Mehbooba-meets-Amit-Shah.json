    "text": "PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday met BJP President Amit Shah amid rising speculation about government formation in Jammu and Kashmir but there was no clear indication whether they have made any headway.\n\nThe PDP, which toughened its stance after Mufti Mohammed Sayeed\u2019s demise by seeking concrete plans for the State\u2019s development before the coalition could be resumed, may latch on to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley\u2019s statement in the Lok Sabha in which he promised speedy implementation of all the projects.\n\nThe PDP president, who was in the national capital to attend the budget session of Parliament, drove in a car without security for a meeting that lasted nearly 30 minutes.\n\nBoth the parties maintained silence on the meeting but sources in the know said it was part of the intense efforts being undertaken by the two parties before resuming the coalition.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu, who is considered one of the architects of the coalition worked during Sayeed\u2019s time, is also understood to have been doing the ground work for bringing together PDP which has 27 MLAs and BJP\u2019s 25 MLAs in the 87-member State Assembly.\n\nThe sources said consultations with some of the ministries have been undertaken and the State may soon witness the end of Governor\u2019s rule which came into force from January 8 this year after Ms Mehbooba decided against taking over the reins after her father Mufti Mohammed Sayeed\u2019s death.\n\nMr Jaitley had announced in Parliament earlier this week that the Centre will speedily implement all the projects announced as part of special package to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister has announced special package for J&K. We want that the three regions of the J&K are developed very fast,\u201d Mr Jaitley said in reply to debate on Budget in the Lok Sabha on Monday.\n\nMs Mehbooba had said last month that before taking a call on continuing the alliance, she wants to \u201creassess\u201d whether the Narendra Modi government would take substantive steps within a \u2018set time-frame\u2019 to address the \u201ccore\u201d political and economic issues of the State. -= PTI",
