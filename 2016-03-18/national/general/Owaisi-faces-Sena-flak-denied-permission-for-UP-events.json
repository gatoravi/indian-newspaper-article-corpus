    "text": "The Shiv Sena today took on AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi for his refusal to chant \u201cBharat Mata Ki Jai\u201d and sought revocation of citizenship and voting rights of those who refuse to chant the slogan even as authorities in Uttar Pradesh denied permission to him to hold two events.\n\nAs the row over Owaisi\u2019s recent remark in Latur escalated, the Sena also sought to know from ally BJP leader and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis how Owaisi was allowed to leave the state after \u201cinsulting\u201d the country.\n\nIn a vitriolic editorial in party mouthpiece \u2018Saamana\u2019, the Sena said, \u201cHardik Patel had by mistake disrespected the national flag and he was tried for sedition and is still in jail. Has Asaduddin Owaisi not committed treason as well by insulting mother India? The citizenship and voting rights of all those who do not chant \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 should be revoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a BJP Chief Minister in the state. He has to answer how was Owaisi allowed to leave Latur after insulting the country,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Muslim community has remained \u201cbackward\u201d due to the ideas propagated by people like Owaisi, the Sena said hitting out at the AIMIM leader.\n\nHowever, MPCC spokesman Al\u2014Nasser Zakaria alleged that the Sena is only indulging in politics of hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cThey (the Sena) should understand that they will be taken seriously, even by their own ally (BJP) after they come clean themselves. Merely chanting slogans won\u2019t make them nationalists,\u201d Zakaria said.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Owaisi\u2019s programme in Lucknow on Thursday was cancelled after he was denied permission by the district administration to hold a meeting on grounds of \u201claw and order situation\u201d in the state. An angry AIMIM slammed the SP government\u2019s decision to deny permission, saying it was \u201cafraid\u201d of Owaisi it had \u201cdone nothing\u201d for the minorities.\n\nOwaisi was denied permission by the district administration to hold a meeting in Lucknow on grounds of \u201claw and order situation\u201d in the State. - PTI",
