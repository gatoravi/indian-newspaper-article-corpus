He said doctors were summoned from JJ Hospital and St George\u2019s Hospital and all them opined that he was \u201cfit and fine\u201d. He said the agency was unable to confront Mr Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer together on statements made by some witnesses.\n\nHe added that there has been a cash flow of Rs 200 crore that took place inside the Mumbai Education Trust (MET) and on being questioned about it, Mr Bhujbal, who is the chairman of the educational institute, would say, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Urging for an extension of his custody, Mr Venegavkar said the \u201ccrucial part (of the investigation) has not been completed.\u201d\n\nThe court observed that sufficient ground has not been made out by the ED to collect independent evidence against the accused (Bhujbal).",
