Nearly 40,000 people assembled to watch the \u2018Super 10\u2019 match in the ICC World T-20 in the Eden and the support for Pakistan was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d cricket correspondents of Bangladesh and some spectators said.\n\nAzad Majumdar, Sports Editor of one of the leading papers of Bangladesh New Age , told The Hindu that he \u201cnever expected\u201d such support for Pakistan.\n\n\u201cEleven Bengalis were playing in the Eden Gardens only two days before the India-Pakistan match. We all thought that the entire support would go to Bangladesh as the defeat of Pakistan would have demoralised them before a match with India. More importantly [we expected the support] as Bangladesh was playing in the Eden Gardens after 26 years,\u201d Mr. Majumdar said.\n\n\u201cBut what we witnessed shocked us. It was only about 1,500 Bangladeshi supporters who supported Bangladesh and the entire local crowd backed Pakistan,\u201d said Mr. Majumdar, also the AFP correspondent in Bangladesh.\n\nThe event has surprised British-Bangladeshi Sabir Mustafa, who is holidaying in Kolkata, and went to the Eden Gardens to watch the match. \u201cSeventy per cent of the support was for Pakistan. I thought it would be other way round in Eden,\u201d said Mr. Mustafa.\n\n\u201cBoth teams were getting support from the locals, but every time Pakistani batsmen hit a boundary the cheers were deafening, while the cheers for Bangladesh were a bit muted,\u201d he said. The support, in fact, surprised Pakistan cricketers as well. Former skipper Mohammad Hafeez said at the post-match press conference that the support was \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever expected to hear Pakistan jitega [Pakistan will win] in Kolkata. It was unbelievable,\u201d Hafeez said.",
