    "text": "JNU students, who have been served show-cause notices by the university authorities in connection with the February 9 protest event on the campus, have refused to accept the report findings, and will send their replies to the notice \u201cjust for the sake of it.\u201d\n\nA decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students\u2019 Council meeting which went on till late on Thursday night. Ever since they received the notices, the students have been maintaining that they do not have anything to submit before the proctor, as the report itself is \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe inquiry report is based on an unfair probe process, hence, we refused to accept its findings... Our replies to the show-cause notice will be sent accordingly,\u201d a member of the council said. Show-cause notices were issued to 21 students on March 14 asking them to explain why disciplinary action should not be initiated against them after the high-level committee of the university found them guilty of \u201cviolating university norms and discipline rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have communicated to the JNU administration how the inquiry committee has violated principles of natural justice in the inquiry process. The JNU administration has neither addressed our concerns nor taken any steps regarding this. Without addressing these concerns, no free and fair inquiry is possible,\u201d JNUSU general secretary Rama Naga said. The students also added that in the absence of any specific charges against them in the inquiry report, the show-cause notice has already held them guilty.\n\nThe inquiry report is based on an unfair probe process, says Students' Council",
