It upholds the highest ideals of Islam and has always rejected the forces of terrorism and extremism,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderlining that Islam is a religion of peace, Mr. Modi said: \u201cWhen we think of the 99 names of Allah, none stand for force and violence, and that the first two names denote compassionate and merciful. Allah is Rahman and Raheem.\u201d While asserting that the fight against terror was not a fight against any religion but one between humanism and inhumanity, he hit out at terror as a threat to religion itself. \u201cTerrorists distort a religion whose cause they profess to support.\u201d",
