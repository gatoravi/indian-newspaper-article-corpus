The Ramsar Convention is an internationally accepted treaty to protect and conserve wetlands.\n\n\u201cThe wetland is further protected by the East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act since 2006 and by a 1992 Calcutta High Court judgment that has made any construction within the 12,500 hectare area illegal. To set up a building within this wetland is a travesty of law,\u201d Mr. Ghosh said.\n\nA noted environmental activist, who mapped and named the wetland, Mr. Ghosh urged the AoL founder to stop the construction.\n\n\u201cSadly, a permanent building has been constructed within this protected area. To be on the right side of law, I hope this wrongful construction will be demolished by the Trust that has built it,\u201d said Mr. Ghosh.\n\nSince the wetland is a Ramsar Site, any construction\n\non it is illegal,\n\nsays activist",
