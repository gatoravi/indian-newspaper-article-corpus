    "text": "Doctors have performed China\u2019s first successful open heart surgery using a 3D-printed heart model to save a nine-month-old baby suffering from a severe heart defect.\n\nThe boy, who weighed 5.6 kg before surgery, was experiencing shortness of breath after birth and was diagnosed with congenital heart defect.\n\nThe surgery performed in the northeast Jilin Province was the first open heart surgery performed using 3D printing technology through which a full-sized heart replica modelled the boy\u2019s cardiac structure and helped doctors plan the operation, Xinhua reported.\n\n\u201cWith this, we were able to know precisely where and how we should cut, and how big the incision should be. With such a thorough plan, we spent only half the time we had expected to complete the surgery,\u201d Zhang Xueqin, surgeon at the People\u2019s Hospital of Jilin said.\n\nThe infant is recovering in the general ward. \u2014 PTI",
