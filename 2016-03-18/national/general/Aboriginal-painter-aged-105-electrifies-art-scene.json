    "text": "Loongkoonan\u2019s indigenous work, depicting bush tucker and medicine, is now being displayed overseas\n\nAustralian artist Loongkoonan only began painting aged about 95, little more than ten years on her works have electrified the indigenous art scene and are now being exhibited overseas.\n\nThe softly-spoken centenarian, who as an artist goes by one name, arrives at the Art Gallery of South Australia wearing a lightweight silver jacket over a bright blue floral dress, and a black bowler hat on her head.\n\nShe\u2019s tired after the long journey from her community in remote Western Australia, but is nonetheless thrilled to see her canvasses on display as part of the prestigious Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really happy,\u201d she says, in comments interpreted from her indigenous Nyikina language by her niece Annie Milgin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really, really proud.\u201d\n\nBorn around 1910, Ms. Loongkoonan has defied the statistics relating to Australia\u2019s Aborigines who have, on average, a markedly shorter life expectancy than their fellow citizens and are the country\u2019s most disadvantaged people. Diane Mossenson, whose gallery in Perth has shown her work, says Ms. Loongkoonan\u2019s family attribute her good health in part to traditional remedies, adding that the artist\u2019s eyesight has always been \u201cbrilliant\u201d. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take any Western medicines at all except for perhaps a Panadol (painkiller) when she\u2019s got a little bit of an ache or a pain,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all bush medicine.\u201d Throughout her long life, Ms. Loongkoonan has maintained her connection to her traditional culture and lifestyle, and today lives in the small community of Jarlmadangah in Australia\u2019s far northwestern Kimberley region.\n\n\u201cSo how much of her life is spent doing things like fishing and hunting? She still does that,\u201d explains Ms. Mossenson.\n\nMs. Loongkoonan\u2019s life is written into her work \u2014 bright depictions of bush tucker (food), natural springs and other geographical features of the Australian Outback, working on cattle stations, and growing up alongside the Fitzroy River.\n\nAnd as an elder of the Nyikina people from the central western Kimberley region, she is the custodian of much traditional language and lore, and strives to impart her knowledge through her art.\n\nFrom the start, Ms. Loongkoonan\u2019s style, which the artist has previously described as painting the landscape \u201cthe same way eagles see country when they are high up in the sky\u201d, was distinctive and arresting. \u201cWhen Loongkoonan\u2019s first and early paintings came in, although they were rather raw and simple in a way by contrast to what\u2019s currently on show, they still had an amazing graphic element to them and a really lovely energy,\u201d says Ms. Mossenson.\n\n\u201cThat was just the way she chose to want to paint and portray her country.\u201d\n\nMs. Loongkoonan\u2019s works have recently had their first international exhibition at the Australian embassy in Washington, and Ms. Mossenson says they don\u2019t always fit the norm of what is the expected style of Aboriginal painting, with some slow to recognise her work. \u201cThe puzzle for me as we\u2019ve been representing has been these most amazingly beautiful works ... have been embraced by some people, but broadly within those that thought they knew everything about Aboriginal art there has been in some ways a slow recognition of her work,\u201d she says.\n\nBut to her niece Annie Milgin, Ms. Loongkoonan\u2019s works are not only beautiful.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s talking about bush medicine, and the bush tucker. And that\u2019s what she learned from her mother and her father and her grandmothers,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Mossenson, who says Ms. Loongkoonan did not have children of her own but brought up many of her nieces and nephews, adds the artist is someone for whom painting keeps her healthy in mind, spirit and body, even though she is currently having a break. Asked if she feels strong when she is painting, Ms. Loongkoonan agrees, saying she would only stop if she felt \u201creally, really sick\u201d.\n\nIndigenous Australian art is considered the oldest ongoing tradition of art in the world, but it was not until the 1970s that it began to receive widespread recognition in the West. \u2014 AFP",
