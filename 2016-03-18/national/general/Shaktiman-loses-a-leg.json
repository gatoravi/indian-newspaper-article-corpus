According to Uttarakhand Director-General of Police B.S. Sidhu, the amputation was \u201cunavoidable and urgent\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe opinion of the doctors was that Shaktiman might lose its life by Friday morning due to the spread of gangrene, if the amputation is not done. That is why we decided to go for amputation. It was diagnosed that the blood circulation to the injured part of leg had stopped,\u201d Mr. Sidhu told The Hindu on phone.\n\nShaktiman\u2019s hind leg was fractured after the horse was allegedly attacked by BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi during a protest in Dehradun. Earlier, a team of ten doctors performed a five-hour surgery on the horse. Despite many attempts of its caretakers, Shaktiman, could not stand on its own. The horse had refused to eat after operation, said officials who were taking care of it.",
