The Maharashtra Congress president, Ashok Chavan, distanced himself from the motion, saying since he is not a member of the Assembly, \u201che has no idea about what transpired there.\u201d\n\nMr. Chavan, in fact, criticised the BJP, the NCP and the Sena for \u201cusing the slogan as a political tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has a problem with saying \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 but I think it becomes problematic when the RSS and the BJP impose it on others to score political points,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Mr. Chavan denied receiving any communication from the senior leadership, he said the party would try and understand why its MLAs chose to toe the rival parties\u2019 political line.\n\nThe chairman of the party\u2019s minority cell, Khurshid Ahmed Saiyed, said he would discuss the issue with the senior leadership but, in the same breath, downplayed the incident, giving a vague explanation. \u201cJai Hind is the most patriotic slogan. The Congress has been saying Jai Hind from 1925; it was the favourite slogan of Subas Chandra Bose but \u2018Bharat Mata Ki Jai\u2019 is the slogan of RSS. We don\u2019t like the way they (RSS) are trying to use it against us.\u201d\n\nThe worst by Congress MLAs came when BJP leader Eknath Khadse sought an apology from Mr. Pathan to end the matter. They shouted down Mr. Khadse and demanded Mr. Pathan\u2019s suspension. Their cry was backed by the NCP, BJP and Sena leaders.\n\nRevoke citizenship: Sena\n\nMumbai Special Correspondent reports:\n\nSlamming AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi for his refusal to chant \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019, the Shiv Sena on Thursday called for revoking the citizenship and voting rights of those who refuse to chant the slogan, and supported Mr. Pathan\u2019s suspension from the Maharashtra Assembly.\n\n\u201cHardik Patel has been arrested for unintentional disrespect to the national tricolour and is still in jail on charges of sedition. Hasn\u2019t Asaduddin Owaisi committed treason by insulting Mother India?\u201d asked an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamna .",
