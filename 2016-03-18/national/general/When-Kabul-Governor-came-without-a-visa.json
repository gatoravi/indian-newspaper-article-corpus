The permit was provided on \u201cgratis\u201d basis.\n\n\u201cThe Afghanistan government official had a diplomatic passport but there was no visa on it. He was stopped by the immigration authorities. Since he is a diplomat, we extended all cooperation and provided him the temporary landing permit,\u201d a senior government official said.\n\nThe temporary landing permit is valid for three days.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that the official was not aware of the rules. Even diplomatic passport holders require a visa to travel abroad. There were 35 others with him who refused to proceed without him and there was a minor commotion at the airport,\u201d said the official.\n\nThe chartered plane from Afghanistan landed at 5 p.m. at the Kolkata airport and the delegates were to watch the cricket match at 7 p.m.\n\nOfficials fast-track temporary permit, allow him and his team to watch T20 match at Kolkata",
