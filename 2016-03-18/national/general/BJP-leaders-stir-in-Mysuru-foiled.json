    "text": "The Mysuru city police on Thursday foiled an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party to lay siege to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office here to protest against the delay in the arrest of culprits behind the murder of party worker Raju.\n\nThe police had blocked roads leading to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office with barricades and guarded the entry points to prevent the protesters from proceeding to the office.\n\nTop State leaders, including B.S. Yeddyurappa, Pralhad Joshi, Shobha Karandlaje and Pratap Simha, along with activists were taken into preventive custody near the MUDA office on JLB Road when they tried to go towards the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office.\n\nThe leaders were taken in police vans to the DAR grounds and released later.\n\nAfter their release, however, the leaders headed straight to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office not to protest but to submit a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner C. Shikha urging the district administration to nab Raju\u2019s killers and provide a job to one of the members of his family, besides enhancing compensation from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh.",
