    "text": "The Delhi High Court will hear on March 23 a batch of petitions seeking cancellation of six months\u2019 interim bail granted to JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar. The petitioners have contended that Mr. Kumar was violating the bail conditions.\n\nJustice Suresh Kait, before whom the case was listed after it was referred to the Chief Justice by another Bench, said he would hear arguments on the three petitions on March 23.\n\nThough counsel R.P. Luthra, representing petitioner Prashant Kumar Umrao, sought to argue that there was an urgency in the matter, the judge refused to hear him any further.\n\nMr. Luthra said the damage was \u201cbeing multiplied\u201d due to Mr. Kumar\u2019s speeches and sought the hearing next Monday. However, the Bench declined his request.\n\nPetitioners Mr. Umrao and Vineet Jindal have contended that Mr. Kumar\u2019s activities and speeches subsequent to his release on interim bail on March 2 in a sedition case, reflected his \u201canti-national\u201d pursuit.",
