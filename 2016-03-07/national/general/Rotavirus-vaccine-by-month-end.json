The challenges in India were different from the West and hence the Western ideas could not be copied here, she pointed out. We need to step up treatment options for malaria, tuberculosis, kala azar \u2013 diseases that the West did not have to worry about, she said at the University\u2019s convocation on Sunday.\n\nThe University awarded six honorary doctorate degrees on eminent professionals in the field of engineering, science, medicine, social science and theology.",
