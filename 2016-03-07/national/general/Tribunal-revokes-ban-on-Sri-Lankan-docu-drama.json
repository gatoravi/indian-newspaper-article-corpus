    "text": "The film-makers have agreed to morph the LTTE flags, cut out photographs of its slain leaders, issue a health warning against narcotics and put up a disclaimer that the film is a work of fiction inspired by real events.\n\nM. Mathialagan, Regional Officer at the Central Board of Film Certification in Chennai, told The Hindu that the film was banned after extensive consultation with senior censor board officials, which included its Mumbai-based chairman Pahlaj Nilhani. \u201cThey [film-makers] have shown an Indian girl rolling a hundred rupee note of Indian currency and snorting drugs through it. How can they disrespect our currency?,\u201d said Mr. Mathialagan.\n\n\u201cThere is a picture of Prabakaran and the LTTE flag in a couple of scenes. It is a clear PR exercise for them [Prabakaran and LTTE],\u201d he added.",
