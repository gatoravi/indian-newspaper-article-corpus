Rohini, as chief guest and National Commission for Women Chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam as guest of honour.\n\nThe former Additional Solicitor-General of India and senior advocate, Indira Jaising, objected to the choice of the High Court as the venue.\n\n\u201cOne can have no objection to the Chief Justice being the chief guest on International Women\u2019s Day anywhere else; in fact, that is to be welcomed. But to do so in the High Court is to throw the weight of the court behind this particular organisation. It is not as if the premises of the court can be hired out for a price by anyone, even if it be for a highly laudable purpose,\u201d Ms. Jaising said in an e-mail on Sunday.\n\nA former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing \u201c per se objectionable\u201d about sitting judges participating in events organised by lawyers\u2019 body as long as they were not \u201cpolitical events.\u201d",
