If the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front [AIUDF] get more seats, then there will be no stopping illegal migrants. Therefore, we want alliances with everyone other than these two for the good of greater Assamese society,\u201d Mr. Sonowal said.\n\nHe has been invoking the symbolism of the medieval Battle of Saraighat, when the Ahom kings under the legendary general Lachit Borpuhukan repulsed an attack by the Mughals in 1671.\n\n\u201cThe battle of Saraighat protected our swabhiman [self-respect] also our sovereign territory from the Mughals. It was Lachit Borphukan, along with his deputy known as Ismail Sidiique, also referred to as \u201cbagh [tiger] Hazarika\u201d who protected Assam,\u201d he said, likening it to preserving indigenous Assamese identity from infiltration.\n\nHe dismissed any suggestions that the NDA government had gone back on its word on not operationalising the Indo-Bangladesh land boundary agreement that saw Assam lose vast tracts of land. \u201cIt is because of the clarity of the land boundary agreement that the work to fence the borders between India and Bangladesh at Dhubri, Cachar and Karimganj can take place,\u201d he said. \u201cHome Minister Rajnath Singh has visited Dhubri and Karimganj in January and made a commitment for fencing of the borders,\u201d he said.\n\nCentre\u2019s aid\n\nHe pointed out that it was under the NDA, that the State got Rs. 144 crore to carry on the work of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that would determine citizenship of India. \u201cThis was not updated under the Congress, after the tripartite meeting in 2005, held by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, where the State government, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the All-Assam Students Union, the three signatories to the Assam accord were present, and it was decided that the NRC would be done in the next two years. They just did the pilot project, in Barpeta and Chaygaon constituencies, where there was resistance from minorities, and the government took the plea of that protest to suspend this,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi\u2019s declaration that the fight in Assam was between him and Prime Minister Modi, not Mr. Sonowal, he termed the three-term Chief Minister \u201cfrustrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe started his politics with the \u2018mosquito net and blanket\u2019 strategy of povertarianism and doles, and after 15 years he has run out steam. Nearly nine lakh people have moved out of the State looking for small jobs in other States,\u201d he said. \u201cNowadays, young people are greatly exposed to what\u2019s happening in other States, and want development,\u201d he added.\n\nBJP leader says Congress has run out of steam after 15 years in power in Assam",
