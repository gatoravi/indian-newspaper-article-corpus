    "text": "While many women across the world will be celebrating International Women\u2019s Day on Tuesday, some who are in the Naxalite fold will presumably be criss-crossing the unforgiving countryside, which they have been doing for many years. The presence of women cadres, especially Adivasis from Adilabad district, among the outlaws has become the point of focus against the background of the IWD with the police department here slamming Maoists for luring naive and minor girls into insurgency.\n\n\u201cAdivasi girls, in particular, have no clue about the underground movement run by the Communist Party of India (Maoist). This is definitely not ethical and certainly a violation of rights,\u201d Adilabad Superintendent of Police Tarun Joshi said, even as information of Maoists looking for \u2018recruitment\u2019 in the tribal habitations comes from different parts of Telangana.\n\n\u201cI did not understand a thing when I joined the movement in 1988 at the age of 15,\u201d concurred Kursenga Motibai alias Radhakka, a Gond tribal from Linguguda village in Adilabad mandal who spent 28 years as an outlaw. \u201cThere were two other girls from my village who had also joined the movement the same day,\u201d she added as she recalled that fateful day when she left home for a life in the jungles.\n\nRadhakka, however, swears by Maoists for rooting for equality between men and women. \u201cThe party responds to women\u2019s problems and issues,\u201d she stated.\n\n\u201cThis contention will not stand scrutiny. The extremists need to answer what was their compulsion to admit innocent girls into the movement which actually deprives them of their future,\u201d demands a woman activist.",
