People remained indoors and business establishments downed the shutters at the district headquarters Biharsharief. The NDA leaders charged that the RJD MLA had not been arrested yet as he had got \u201cprotection\u201d from the government.\n\nThe RJD MLA from Nawada has been absconding for a month in connection with the alleged rape of a minor girl from adjacent Nalanda district.\n\nThe incident happened on the night of February 6 and the complaint against the MLA was registered with the Nalanda police on February 9.\n\nFollowing the arrest warrant from the local court, the district police of Nawada and Nalanda have been conducting raids at all possible hideouts and have also attached immovable properties of the MLA.",
