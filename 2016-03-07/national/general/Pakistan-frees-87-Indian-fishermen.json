    "text": "Pakistan on Sunday released 87 Indian fishermen held for violating its territorial waters and officials said a similar number would be freed later this month.\n\n\u201cWe have 536 Indian fishermen in prison and today [on Sunday] we released 87 of them while 86 more will be released on March 20,\u201d said deputy superintendent of Karachi\u2019s Landhi prison, Shakir Shah.\n\nMr. Shah said those released on Sunday had been in jail for more than two and a half years. They were freed after verification of their travel documents sent by the Indian authorities.\n\nIndian and Pakistani fishermen are frequently detained for illegal fishing since the Arabian Sea border is not clearly defined and many boats lack the technology to fix their precise location.\n\nLast week Pakistani maritime security forces detained 20 Indian fishermen and impounded four boats. \u2014 AFP",
