It pointed to the fallout of the transfers of the then Muzaffarnagar DM, Surendra Singh, and the then SSP, Manzil Saini, as they triggered anger among the Hindus, especially Jats.\n\nThe report said inflammatory speeches were made by members of both communities and put the blame for the riots on the \u201cacute communal divide\u201d in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts because of the Kanwal incident of August 27, 2013. \u201cThe riots resulted from the \u2018polarisation\u2019 between Hindus and Muslims as a consequence of the Kanwal incident, in which a Muslim youth Shahnawaz and two Hindu youths Sachin and Gaurav were killed,\u201d the report says. The commission also pointed to the role of the social and print media in rumour-mongering and exaggerating reports but did not single out any group.\n\nSenior lawyer Asad Hayat, a co-petitioner in a Muzaffarnagar riots case in the Supreme Court, called the report a \u201ccover-up.\u201d \u201cWhat was the use of the commission if it cannot take action against leaders like Sangeet Som? What legal use will it serve for victims? Over 80 murders were not considered part of the riots. Why has the commission failed to reach out to those people?\u201d Mr. Hayat said.\n\nShehzad Poonawalla, a petitioner in the case, condemned the report for giving a \u201cclean chit\u201d to the government and BJP leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat was the use of the Commission if it cannot take action against leaders like Som?\u201d",
