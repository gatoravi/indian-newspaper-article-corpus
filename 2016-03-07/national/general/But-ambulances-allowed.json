    "text": "Bike ambulances, operational in Karnataka, are allowed to function as they are government owned vehicles being used for public service. The exemption is allowed by means of a government notification for the same, officials said. There are 18 bike ambulances that are operating in the city.\n\nEarlier this week, Ola and Uber announced the launch of bike taxi services which prompted the Transport Department to issue a statement that such services were illegal. The move also led to the RTO cracking down on ride share models being operated by aggregators. In the past week, officials have seized bike taxis and a few ride share cars being operated by aggregators for violation of permit conditions.",
