    "text": "As a measure of choking terror funding, a local court has ordered confiscation of the assets seized from an accused arrested by the Delhi police in 2006 and then attached by the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nDubai-based money exchanger Nasir Safi Mir was arrested on February 3, 2006, after the police seized from him Rs.55 lakh in cash, ammunition and some bomb-making components. Within three months, the police filed a charge sheet against him, accusing him of terror funding and waging war against the state.\n\nFor its part, the ED investigated the terror funding allegations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Subsequently, the agency attached Rs. 55 lakh that was seized from Mir, who absconded in October 2007 after being granted bail on health grounds.\n\nThe attachment was confirmed by the PMLA adjudicating authority, following which the Directorate filed a charge sheet against the accused in March 2014.\n\nOn the ED\u2019s request, the court recently ordered confiscation of Rs. 55 lakh.",
