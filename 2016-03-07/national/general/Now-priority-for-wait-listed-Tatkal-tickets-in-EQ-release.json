    "text": "The Railways have gone one step ahead in making the emergency quota (EQ) system more responsive and commuter-friendly by giving priority to wait-listed Tatkal tickets. From now, wait-listed tickets purchased from travel agents will not be considered for allotment of seats and berths under EQ.\n\nThis is aimed at preventing misuse of EQ and to ensure that its benefits reach needy commuters.\n\nThe directive follows a decision of the Railways to make the EQ facility more commuter-friendly and to provide senior citizens and the needy priority during allocation of lower berths and to open a helpline.\n\nThe EQ facility has so far been confined to stations from where trains originate, major stations, and divisional headquarters.\n\nSenior Divisional Railway Manager, Thiruvananthapuram, V.S. Sudheesh said the Railways had received an overwhelming response.\n\n\u201cRequests for EQ from the offices of elected representatives and officials have come down drastically, and the Railways are getting requests from the needy now. We are acknowledging requests mailed to us [seniordcmtvc@\n\ngmail.com],\u201d he said.",
