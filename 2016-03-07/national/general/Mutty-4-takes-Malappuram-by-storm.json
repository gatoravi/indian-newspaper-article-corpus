A Mutty-4 tournament held at Cherumukku near Tirurangadi on Saturday night saw 52 teams from the neighbourhoods participating in it.\n\nCompact, quick\n\nThe tournament, which began at 9 p.m. on Saturday, went on to Sunday morning. Sacrificing their sleep, a large number of youngsters witnessed the final match played at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday. \u201cThe popularity of the game is amazing. It\u2019s largely because of the compactness and quickness of the game,\u201d said M. Shafi, president of the Action and Sports Club, Tirurangadi, which organised the tournament.\n\nThe game got its name Mutty-4 from the style of play permitted within the small field having a diameter of less than 22 metre.\n\n\u201cWe held the tournament in a 17-metre ground,\u201d said Mr. Shafi. Each team comprising seven members could play three overs. When no fast-bowling was permitted, the batsmen had many restrictions too. Apart from the usual catches and stumping, a hit over the boundary could get the batsman out. The batsmen playing on a seven-metre-long pitch could pick up runs from drives to all positions except slips, third man, gully, leg gully, and fine leg.\n\nA knock going past the wicket-keeper did not bring any run.\n\nHowever, no-balls and wides had runs. The game had no leg-byes. \u201cIt was all about spinning with the softball and driving along the ground without getting out,\u201d said A.K. Mustafa, a promoter of the game.\n\nThe umpire could use his discretion to decide the optimum speed of the ball. Beyond a limit, he could call it a dead ball. The Kings team of Pantharangadi won the championship when the S.S. team from Vallikkunnu became the runner-up.",
