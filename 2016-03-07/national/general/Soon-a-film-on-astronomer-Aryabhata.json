I am working on a film on Aryabhata. It is an interesting story to tell viewers about his contribution,\u201d said Kumar, who was announced the winner of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award on Friday.\n\n\u201cThree years we have been working on script, as it is a difficult subject to deal with,\u201d the 78-year-old added. Aryabhata was a pioneer during the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy.\n\nKumar is scouting for newcomers for the film.\n\n\u201cWe are working with Kishore Namit Kapoor who has trained some of the most prominent film actors. He will help us with it (casting),\u201d Kumar said. \u2014 PTI",
