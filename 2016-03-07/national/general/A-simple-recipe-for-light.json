Electricity can be produced when two electrodes (one that can readily give away its electrons, and another to accept them as easily) are dipped in an electrolyte.\n\nVasant Natarajan from the Physics Department of the IISc. refined on this concept. A box is made with four cells. A solution of 600 ml water and two tablespoons of salt is poured into the container and the lid, which contains a magnesium and graphite electrode, is closed.\n\nTried and tested, the battery is now being manufactured by Suryagen Renewable Energy Ltd., which was conceived based on the ideas of Mr. Natarajan, who aims to take physics out of the lab and into the villages. \u201cSince we have just started, and we do not have a large number of orders, the setup costs Rs. 700. But, we hope to reduce it to less than Rs. 500 in the coming months through mass manufacture,\u201d said Santosh H., head of Syryagen\u2019s Product Development Team.",
