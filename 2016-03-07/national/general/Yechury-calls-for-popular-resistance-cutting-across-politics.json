There is a need for popular resistance cutting across political parties, rising above all differences,\u201d he said, addressing the concluding session of the Mumbai Collective at the Y.B. Chavan centre.\n\n\u201cThis is not limited to certain elections or alliances formed for the sake of electoral politics,\u201d Mr Yechury said.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s resistance has to be the centre. It is the battle of ideas that is currently going on in the country and all views must be discussed.\u201d\n\nCiting state action against Jawaharlal Nehru University, Mr. Yechury said all forces joined hands against the government on the matter: \u201cWe as Left were there, but then came Rahul [Gandhi], Nitish\u2019s party [Nitish Kumar\u2019s Janata Dal (United)] , followed by the others. We need to identify and isolate those spreading poison in society.\u201d\n\nD. Raja of the CPI, Jitendra Awhad of the NCP and Kapil Patil of Lokbharati also addressed the session. Mr. Raja called JNU student union leader Kanhaiya Kumar the best product of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative.\n\nEarlier, at a press conference, Mr. Yechury and Mr. Raja said the government was using nationalism to hide misgovernance and its inept handling of the economic crisis. Mr. Yechury said: \u201cFor the West Bengal Assembly elections, our slogan is TMC hatao, Bengal bachao . Let the Congress too say it first. We have formed a united front of all other parties to contest the elections. There is no alliance or front with the Congress today.\u201d",
