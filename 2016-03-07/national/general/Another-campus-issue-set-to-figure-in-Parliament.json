We strongly condemn it. We will coordinate with other parties as well and strongly raise this issue in Parliament.\u201d\n\nMs. Singh is the first woman president of the AUSU, elected after a gap of 128 years, and she has won as an independent candidate.\n\nNotably, the other four members are from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). \u201cAfter Rohith Vemula [Hyderabad University] and Kanhaiya Kumar [JNU] ... they are now trying to target Richa, but we won\u2019t let it happen,\u201d said Mr. Tyagi, adding that Ms. Singh was being deliberately victimised so that she leaves her \u2018presidentship\u2019 and the right-wing ABVP can capture the AUSU.\n\nMr. Tyagi said it was an irony that on the one hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks about \u201cwomen-led development,\u201d but, on the other, the HRD Ministry had shown insensitivity towards Ms. Singh\u2019s alleged harassment on the campus.\n\nJD(U) to raise issue of Allahabad woman student union leader's \u2018harassment\u2019",
