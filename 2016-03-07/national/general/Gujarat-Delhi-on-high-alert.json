    "text": "Late on Saturday night, Gujarat\u2019s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) P.K. Taneja held a marathon meeting with top police officials and also representatives of the BSF, the Coast Guard and other agencies to take stock of the security deployment at sensitive and vulnerable places in the State after the IB shared its inputs.\n\nThis is the second major alert about a possible terror strike in the State, which shares a land and sea border with neighbouring Pakistan.\n\nIn Delhi, security at public places such as malls, cinema halls, markets and along the Delhi borders was stepped up. Police sources said there was no move to cancel the leave of its personnel, or any such emergency action. The NSG teams were on standby as is the routine, officials said.\n\nMystery boat\n\nMeanwhile, Home Ministry sources said a BSF patrolling team had seized a Pakistani boat in Kutch on Friday. They reported seeing some men running to the Pakistan side, one source said.\n\nHowever, officials insist that the recovery of the boat and the terror alert were not connected.\n\nThis was the sixth boat recovered by the BSF since November in the Kutch area. Another boat was recovered about 15 days ago.\n\nOn the intervening night of December 31, 2014 and January 1, 2015 the Coast Guard had claimed to have blasted a Pakistani terror boat.\n\nThe Defence Ministry had claimed that the occupants on board refused to cooperate after being intercepted and blew up the boat.\n\nThe government officials had later identified the purported Pakistani fishing boat as Qalandar and said that they had intelligence to suggest that it had come for an \u201cillicit transaction at sea.\u201d The incident kicked up a controversy and the government had sacked Coast Guard DIG, B.K. Loshali, for contradicting the official stand on the issue.",
