We even warned them that there could be more such political murders.\u201d\n\nPrabhat Patnaik, Professor Emeritus at the Centre for Economic Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, pointed out the significance of pluralism.\n\n\u201cAny thinking requires raising questions which often results in multiple answers from multiple people; multiplicity is thus a symptom of thinking. The killing of multiplicity is the killing of thoughts.\u201d He noted how the various protests had occurred only in public institutions.\n\nThe panel of \u2018Artists against communalism\u2019 featured film-makers Kabir Khan and Anand Patwardhan. Mr. Khan talked about the resistance he faced for naming his movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan, ranging from the VHP filing a case to the speculation that \u2018love jihad\u2019 was the theme of his movie.\n\nBut Mr. Khan refused to buckle under pressure tactics.\n\nDocumentary film-maker Anand Patwardhan reflected how it had become unfashionable to think well of Mahatma Gandhi and argued that it was important to note how radical Gandhi became as he grew older. He showed excerpts from his past work such as Jai Bhim Comrade and War and Peace to shed light on Gandhi\u2019s legacy.\n\nAdvocate Mihir Desai gave a historical breakdown of sedition in India and the correct understanding of the term in its legal sense in the session on \u2018Sedition and the spectre of the anti-national.\u2019\n\nReferring to the sedition trial of Mahatma Gandhi in 1922 as the \u2018Gandhian Blunder\u2019 of the British Empire, he described the case against Kanhaiya Kumar as the \u201cGandhian blunder\u201d of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and HRD Minister Smriti Irani. \u201cIf they had read history, and not mythology, they would have realised their blunder,\u201d said Mr. Desai as he appealed for the removal of the sedition law under Section 124 A of the IPC.\n\nCall for popular resistance\n\nThe final panel of the conclave saw political leaders appeal for popular resistance among the masses against communal and divisive forces.\n\n\u201cMPs and MLAs who used to earlier hand you character certificates are now giving certificates of patriotism and nationalism,\u201d said NCP MLA Jitendra Awhad.\n\n(The author is a freelance writer)",
