    "text": "Former Bangladesh enclave dwellers are practically living within \u201canother enclave\u201d in India\n\n\u201cZero Point\u201d is both a loved and hated phrase in 60-year-old Swapnarani Roy\u2019s lexicon. It is at this point on the Bangladesh-India border in north Bengal that Swapnarani meets her husband twice or thrice a month. Her husband, Balaram Roy, travels nearly 50 kilometres from his village to reach zero point for the rendezvous.\n\nThey gaze at each other for about 10 minutes from a distance of about 15 feet and return to their homes: Swapnarani to her settlement camp in the Mekhliganj subdivision of Cooch Behar and Balaram to Patgram village in Lalmanirhat district of Bangladesh.\n\nZero point ensures that they get to see each other. But it also separates them.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk as my husband starts crying. He asks me why I left with the kids for India after 40 years of our marriage. I can only remain silent\u2026,\u201d Swapnarani said sobbing uncontrollably. An agreement between India and Bangladesh last year empowered the countries to exchange territories. Following the Land Boundary Agreement, more than 900 Indians from the enclaves of north Bangladesh were moved to India and were settled in three camps in Cooch Behar district. Mekhliganj is one such settlement camp. The Roy family is the victim of a complex 2011 survey that preceded the 2015 agreement. The survey asked enclave-dwellers if they wanted to stay back or leave for the neighbouring country. But the problem was many, like Balaram Roy, were left out of the survey. \u201cThere was a communal riot in our enclave-village [Patgram] in Lalmanirhat district in Bangladesh. My husband ran away and within a few months of the riot the survey took place. My husband was not in the village and his name was left out,\u201d said Swapnarani.\n\n\u2018Inhuman survey\u2019\n\nGayatri Burman, 18, of the same camp in Mekhliganj is also separated from her husband, for a different reason. \u201cWe were not married when the survey took place and my husband used to live in the Bangladesh territory, outside the enclave, and was therefore left out,\u201d she said. Bhupal Burman shifted to her wife\u2019s residence in the enclave after their marriage. \u201cBut since his name was not listed, I had to leave with our three-year-old daughter,\u201d she said. Nearly all the families blamed an \u201cinhuman and hasty\u201d survey for their misery.\n\nDiptiman Sengupta, chief coordinator of the erstwhile enclave exchange committee, denied the allegation. \u201cThe survey was done in Bangladesh in a completely free and fair manner and no one was discouraged from leaving Bangladesh,\u201d he told The Hindu . One cannot gain access to the Mekhliganj camp that houses 198 residents, unless government officials of Cooch Behar issue an order. This correspondent entered the camp without permission as no one was manning the entrance early in the evening. While the locals were talking to this correspondent, a middle-aged man appeared with a young civic volunteer. The man introduced himself as constable Rabiram Burman and asked this correspondent to leave \u201cimmediately as no one is allowed in the camp without permission.\u201d Mr. Burman refused to explain why visitors needed permission to meet the camp dwellers, who are now Indian citizens.\n\nLock-Up Register\n\nThe real shocker perhaps is the register that a visitor, once he or she is granted official permission to enter the camp, has to sign. It is a \u2018Lock-Up Register\u2019 which has 13 columns. The guests are made to sign under a column titled \u201cName/Father\u2019s name/Full Address of the Arrestee.\u201d In effect, any outsider entering the camp of the erstwhile enclave dwellers automatically becomes an \u2018offender.\u2019 The other columns are titled \u2018Arrest case No./ General Diary No. and so on. The name of the \u2018arresting officer\u2019 will also have to be mentioned alongside \u201cdate and time of arrest\u201d with \u201clock-up in\u201d and \u201clock up out\u201d timings.\n\nThe District Magistrate of Cooch Behar, P. Ulaganathan, who did a commendable job ensuring a smooth transfer of the enclaves with his officers, was apologetic. \u201cYes, I know it is not desirable and in a few days I will have a word with the SP to remove the chowki,\u201d he said. But why was it there in first place? Two reasons, said Mr Ulaganathan. \u201cOne, there were a few unsavoury incidents and two, it is close to the Bangladesh border.\u201d",
