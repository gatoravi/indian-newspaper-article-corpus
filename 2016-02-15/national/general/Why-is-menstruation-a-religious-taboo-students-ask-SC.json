The students want the apex court to address and decide on whether modern society should continue to bear with \u201cmenstrual discrimination\u201d when the Indian Constitution mandates right to equality and health of women to achieve gender justice.\n\nThe students, represented by senior advocate Indira Jaising, have asked how a religious \u201ctaboo\u201d that prohibits the entry of women aged between 10 and 50 years to the Sabarimala temple continues to be widely accepted and even justified by the authorities in violation of the rights of women under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing on Friday, Justice Misra had asked whether the Vedas, Upanishads and scriptures discriminate between men and women. \u201cIs spirituality solely within the domain of men? Are you saying that women are incapable of attaining spirituality within the domain of religion? Can you deprive a mother?\u201d Justice Misra had asked.",
