The 368-page report was produced by two Kolkata-based research organisations, Association SNAP and Guidance Guild, in association with Prof. Sen\u2019s trust, Pratichi India.\n\nLow literacy rate\n\nThough the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has claimed to have played a significant role in the uplift of Muslims in Bengal since 2011, the report points to little improvement in areas such as literacy, health or participation in work. For example, Muslims have a literacy rate seven per cent lower than the State\u2019s average.\n\n\u201cAround five per cent of those who discontinued education admitted lack of motivation as the factor behind dropping out of school as they did not see any future benefits from education,\u201d the synopsis said. However, the report has not named any political party or held any government institution responsible.\n\nIn the health sector, the condition of, Muslims is no better and the report observes on the basis of State government data and field-level survey that \u201cwhen Muslim population percentage increases in the blocks, the hospital facilities dwindle down.\u201d\n\nAs a result \u201calmost double the number of hospital beds is available in blocks with less than 15 per cent population share of Muslims in comparison with blocks having 50 per cent or above of (Muslim population).\u201d Such discrimination is underscored in nearly every page of the report.\n\nWhile in the entire report it was never said the ruling party in the State is responsible for the discrimination against the main minority of Bengal, it is expected to take political colour as it has been released only months before the Assembly elections.\n\nMuslim bodies differ\n\nOne of the most well-spread cadre-based Islamic political organisation, Jama\u2019at e Islami-Hind (JIH), West Bengal, which does not contest elections or is affiliated to any political party, believe that Muslims of Bengal have \u201cmoderately benefited\u201d during the TMC rule. The media and public relations chief of JIH, Masihur Rahman, underscored how the minorities have benefited during TMC\u2019s rule, without referring to the report.\n\n\u201cFirstly, the number of Muslim students clearing West Bengal Civil Services is much higher than in earlier years. It is 24 this year. Secondly, Aliah University, started during the Left\u2019s time, was given a grant of Rs. 300 crore and many hostels for Muslim girls were built in the districts,\u201d said Mr. Rahman.",
