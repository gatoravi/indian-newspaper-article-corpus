    "text": "The sensational case of a 19-year-old girl being thrown acid at in Husnabad village of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh turned out to be a fake one with the victim herself stating that she had staged the incident.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , a police official, who did not want to be named, said that the girl had told here parents that an unknown person had thrown acid on her while she was returning from a nearby store, thereby sustaining injuries on her neck and shoulder.\n\nThe parents of the girl registered a case and admitted her to the Hindupur government general hospital. The doctors said a mild acid was used in the attack and hence the low intensity of the injuries.\n\nHowever, the girl who returned from more than a week-long treatment at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, continued to shift from one version to the other of the attack, police said.",
