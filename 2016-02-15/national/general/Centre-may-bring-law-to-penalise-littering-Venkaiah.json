    "text": "The Centre may consider bringing in legislation on the lines of what Singapore has done, in imposing a fine on those littering in public places, said Union Minister of Urban Development, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation M. Venkaiah Naidu.\n\nSpeaking at a function to mark valedictory of the Swachh Mangaluru campaign of Ramakrishna Math here on Sunday, Mr. Naidu said the government was focusing its attention on conducting cleaning campaigns across Karnataka.\n\nThe government was providing funds for construction of toilets in every house, and improve infrastructure for solid waste management. \u201cOnce the infrastructure is in place, we will think of bringing in legislation to impose fine on those littering in public places.\u201d\n\nMr. Naidu said the government would consider framing legislation similar to the one in Singapore, where hefty fines were imposed for spitting and throwing waste by the roadside. \u201cPeople have come to me expressing the need to impose fine. But this [framing legislation] should be the last resort,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking to reporters later on the sidelines of a programme at Sanghaniketan here, Mr. Naidu said the Centre was yet to take a decision on the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission.\n\nMr. Naidu said an Empowered Committee of Secretaries has been constituted to study the recommendations. It will look into all aspects, including the drain on the exchequer and also the welfare of government employees.\n\n\u201cThe recommendations will be studied in detail and a final view taken,\u201d he said.",
