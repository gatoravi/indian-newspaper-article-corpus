The MLA has been absconding after an arrest warrant was issued against him on Saturday.\n\nThe Opposition parties met Governor Ram Nath Kovind and sought his intervention to restore law and order, which they said was deteriorating, in the State. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, addressing leaders of his party\u2019s State executive, said \u201caction would be taken against whoever takes the law into his own hands.\u201d\n\nRam Chandra Purve, RJD State president, told The Hindu that the party had taken the rape charge against its MLA Rajballabh Yadav very seriously. On Sunday, a joint team of the Nalanda and Nawada police conducted raids at several places to arrest the absconding MLA.\n\nA tenth standard student belonging to Nalanda district had charged that the 54-year-old MLA from Nawada raped her on February 6 at his residence and warned her against revealing this to anyone. The girl was taken to the MLA\u2019s residence by a woman Sulekha Devi, who lived in her neighbourhood, on the pretext of attending a birthday party.",
