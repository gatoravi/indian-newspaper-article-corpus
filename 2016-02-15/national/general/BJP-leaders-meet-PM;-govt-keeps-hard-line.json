    "text": "Top BJP leaders met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday in a routine pre-Budget meet in which the JNU controversy is believed to have informally come up.\n\nSources said the government\u2019s line remains one that \u201canti-national activity\u201d would not be tolerated.\n\nThis happens at a time when the political polarisation over the JNUSU president\u2019s arrest threatens to cast its shadow on the budget session of Parliament when key Bills like the Goods and Services Tax Bill are pending.\n\n\u201cRahul Gandhi is confused and the Congress is frustrated. They are unable to digest the popularity of the Modi government.\n\nIt is indeed the height of negative politics that the Congress has sided with anti-national forces to target the government,\u201d BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said.\n\nRSS charge\n\nThe RSS too accused the Left parties and the Congress of \u201ccondoning anti-national acts\u201d instead of demanding action against them.\n\n\u201cAt the expense of the exchequer money, instead of studying, students are involving themselves in anti-India activities and some teachers are supporting them. It is serious,\u201d RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya said in a tweet carried on the RSS twitter handle.\n\n\u201cInstead of condemning and demanding strict action against anti-national activities, some political leaders are condoning this act,\u201d he said.\n\nCPI leader D. Raja said he had received threatening calls from two numbers, with one caller claiming to be a gangster.\n\nHe apprised Home Minister Rajnath Singh of this when he met him on Saturday morning, adding that the threats were regarding him and his daughter, an AISF activist in JNU.\n\n\u201cI will write to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister about the threats on Monday,\u201d Mr. Raja told The Hindu .",
