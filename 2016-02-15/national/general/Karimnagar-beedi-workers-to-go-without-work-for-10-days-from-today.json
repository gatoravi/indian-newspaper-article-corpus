Ramesh Babu said that it was a great setback to the beedi industry which was already in the doldrums.\n\nFor the government, the interests of large corporate companies were more important than the beedi workers who were eking out a living with the small amount they earned by rolling beedi, he said.\n\nThere are over seven lakh beedi workers in Telangana of which three lakh are in Nizamabad district alone.\n\nA majority of them are women and they work day and night at homes.\n\nIf the nearly three lakh workers lose their job all of a sudden, the district economy would receive a big blow.",
