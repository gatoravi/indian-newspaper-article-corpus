The numbers, including that of the mother of one of the terrorists killed, were dialled from the snatched phones of taxi driver Ikagar Singh and jeweller Rajesh Verma.\n\nWhile Singh was killed, the terrorists had slit the throat of Verma before throwing him out of the vehicle of the former Gurdaspur SP, Salwinder Singh, which they snatched on the intervening night of December 31-January 1.\n\nThe numbers stand in the names of Jaish-e-Islam, Saad, Molana, Mullah Dadullah, Khayam Baber (the terrorist\u2019s mother) and Kashif Jaan. The numbers are registered with Mobilink, Warid and Telenor, the service-providers in Pakistan.\n\nKashif Jaan, one of the key handlers of the attackers who exchanged a number of calls with them, had been under the scanner of intelligence agencies for long.\n\nOfficials said they had analysed his Facebook profile and found that of the 1,200 people on his Friends list, at least 130 belonged to the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit, which India says had orchestrated the attack.\n\nAccording to investigators, Kashif Jaan was also friends with a few Kashmir-based groups on Facebook.
