    "text": "The Kerala Legislative Assembly will pay special homage to the Bard of Kerala, O.N.V. Kurup, by doing away with the day\u2019s sitting, other than an obituary reference, which makes him the first cultural personality to receive this honour.\n\nThe House will meet only at 11.30 a.m., ostensibly after the funeral. It will adjourn for the day after the obituary reference. There will be no question hour and other businesses listed for the day. There have been couple of occasions when a few personalities had been honoured even though they had never been a member of the legislature. They include Moidu Moulavi, Jayaprakash Narayan, RSP leader Sreekantan Nair, and N.E. Balaram (he was a member of the legislature, but at the time of his death he was Rajya Sabha MP).\n\nThe Assembly had adjourned after making obituary reference when these leaders died. This is the first time the Assembly is honouring a cultural personality.",
