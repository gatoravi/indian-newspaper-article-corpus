The investigators had approached them as they feel Headley had stonewalled information about his family and that they had knowledge of his activities in India and his links with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nAccording to the 106-page dossier of the NIA, Headley had told the Indian investigators that they should not ask him any questions pertaining to his immediate family. \u201cI got married to Shazia Gilani in Pakistan in the year 1999...I do not want to discuss the details of my in-law\u2019s family as they have nothing to do with my activities...,\u201d Headley is quoted as having said in the dossier. According to the Chicago court records, Shazia watched on TV the terror strikes unfold in Mumbai and used code words like \u201cI am watching cartoons\u201d to describe the 26/11 strikes. \u2014 PTI\n\nShazia used code words like \u201cI am watching cartoons\u201d to describe the 26/11 strikes",
