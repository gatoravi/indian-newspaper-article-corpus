    "text": "Online video streaming platforms like Netflix and Showtime are in talks to have actor Daniel Craig star in an adaptation of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s novel Purity . The novel, which will be produced by Scott Rudin and written by Todd Field and Franzen, might star Craig. Rudin is said to have held a round of meetings in search of a straight-to-series order. The novel, published in September, tells the story of an aimless young woman named Purity who, raised in unusual circumstances in California, ends up travelling from Oakland to Bolivia to Denver and has a series of jobs and relationships with equally offbeat characters. \u2014 IANS",
