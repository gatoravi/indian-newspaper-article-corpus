    "text": "Days after a pro-Afzal Guru event condemning his hanging in the Parliament attack case was organised at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, there seems to be a sharp disconnect on the campus, with the administration on the one side and students and teachers on the other.\n\nComing out in support of its students, over 250 JNU teachers on Sunday slammed the Vice-Chancellor and the administration for \u201csubverting\u201d the university\u2019s \u201cinternal mechanisms.\u201d Making a veiled attack on the new Vice-Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar, the group of teachers, which included retired faculty, alleged that the decision to allow the Delhi Police to enter the campus and make \u201crandom arrests\u201d had put the institution\u2019s autonomy at stake. \u201cWe are of the firm opinion that the matter arising out of an event can be and should have been dealt with through established internal institutional mechanisms. Instead of relying on this, the University Administration decided to give a carte blanche to the police to enter the campus to search different premises and even make random arrests,\u201d said Ajay Patnaik, president of the JNU Teacher\u2019s Association.",
