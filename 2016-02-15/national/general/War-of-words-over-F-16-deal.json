As regards F-16 sale, Pakistan and the United States closely cooperate in countering terrorism. A U.S. spokesperson clearly announced that the sale is to enhance precision strike capability,\u201d a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan said.\n\nStrategic commentators were quick to find fault with the statement from the Pakistan Foreign Ministry.\n\n\u201cIndia is not the largest importer of arms. India is one of the big importers. Our weapons acquisition policy is also different from other countries and we cannot, therefore, be slotted with others in purchasing of weapons,\u201d said Uday Bhaskar of the Society for Policy Studies.\n\nEnvoy defends sale\n\nPTI reports:\n\nU.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma described the sale as \u201cpart of a legacy announcement made several years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are technical processes like the Congressional ratification,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a big counter-terrorism insurgency component as well. Over the years our assistance to Pakistan has been a mix of both civilian and military equipment,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Friday, India summoned Mr. Verma for conveying its opposition over the Obama administration\u2019s decision.",
