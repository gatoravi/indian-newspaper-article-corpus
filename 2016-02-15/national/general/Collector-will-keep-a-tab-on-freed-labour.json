With the transformation of society, bonded labour has taken new colours. At this juncture, it is important that such people get a sustainable flow of money on a monthly basis in their bank accounts,\u201d a senior government official said, on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official added that under the new system, the Collector will be able to keep a tab on the rescued workers as he or she will have to sign the money deposit slip every month.\n\nAt present, executive magistrates are empowered to conduct a summary trial of offences to release bonded labourers and issue release certificates under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976.\n\nThe penalties under the Act include imprisonment for a term of up to 3 years and a fine of up to Rs. 2,000.\n\nTrade unions have welcomed the move. But they argue that the labour reforms initiated by the Union government are taking away some of the rights of workers.\n\n\u201cEnhancing the rehabilitation amount is welcome. However, with the labour law amendments the government has proposed, it is pushing workers to a form of slavery by taking away their statutory rights and allowing employers to hire and fire workers,\u201d All India Trade Union Congress secretary D.L. Sachdev said.\n\n\u2018It is important\n\nthat they get a sustainable flow\n\nof money on a monthly basis\u2019",
