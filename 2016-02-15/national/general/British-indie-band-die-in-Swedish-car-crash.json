Other vehicles were waiting for the bridge to close fully but \u201cone car arrived at a crazy speed ... at least 70-80 kph. That\u2019s very quick when everybody else was stopped,\u201d Jonny Alexandersson, a lorry driver who witnessed the incident, told Aftonbladet daily.\n\nNews of the tragedy spread quickly on social media and fellow band The Enemy tweeted: \u201cRIP Viola Beach and their manager. Such incredibly tragic and sad news. Thought with the friends and families of all involved.\u201d\n\nA contributor to Viola Beach\u2019s Facebook page wrote: \u201cSo awful. Taken before anybody had the chance to see what they might have become.\u201d Another wrote: \u201cSuch sad news, you guys were gonna be big.\u201d\n\nThe band had been in Sweden for afestival in the central city of Norrkoping. \u2014 AFP",
