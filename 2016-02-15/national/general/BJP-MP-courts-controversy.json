Raising anti-India slogans and working in alliance with anti-India forces are activities that can never be tolerated. These people are traitors,\u201d the BJP told The Hindu from his constituency.\n\n\u201cTraitors don\u2019t deserve jail. Life term is too less a punishment for them. The punishment which they need is either police bullets or execution,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Maharaj attacked the Congress party for \u201cappeasing traitors\u201d and \u201cencouraging\u201d them. \u201cThere is a political party which since Independence has only appeased this section which engages in anti-national activities. Stringent steps are needed to deal with traitors,\u201d he said.",
