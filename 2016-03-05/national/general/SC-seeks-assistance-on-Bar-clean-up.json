    "text": "The Supreme Court Bench, which on Friday decided to set up a Constitution Bench to evolve a filtering mechanism to clean up the legal profession and prevent anti-social elements from becoming lawyers, gave senior advocate K.K. Venugopal and senior lawyers four days to suggest points of reference. Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, heading the Bench, comprising Justices R. Banumathi and U.U. Lalit, said the case would be called up in another week.\n\nThe Bench was dealing with a petition challenging the legality of the Bar Council of India holding the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) without statutory backing.\n\nAsking whether the country deserved \u201chalf-baked lawyers\u201d, the court pointed out that the system had already been burdened with two million advocates.",
