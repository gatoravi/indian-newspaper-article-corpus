Speaker Sumitra Mahajan made the announcement of his death in the House and said she learnt from the departed leader, who used to run the House with a smile as its presiding officer from 1996 to 1998.\n\nHe was also elected to the Lower House nine times.\n\nMr. Sangma, who was born in 1947 at Chapahati in the West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, earned a master\u2019s degree in International Relations from Dibrugarh University in Assam and studied law. His first big political break came when he became general secretary of the Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee in 1975.

From 1988 to 1990, he served as Meghalaya CM.\n\nIn the Narasimha Rao government, in the 1990s, he was given Independent charge of the Coal Ministry.\n\nMr. Sangma broke away from his parent party, along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar, in 1999, raising the banner of revolt against Sonia Gandhi\u2019s leadership.

He took on Pranab Mukherjee in the contest for President, supported by the BJP and some other parties. After he lost, he filed an election petition against the election of Mr. Mukherjee.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Sangma founded the National People\u2019s Party.\n\nKnown for his affable nature, Mr. Sangma was considered by many as the tallest north-eastern leader in terms of national stature.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: \u201cShri PA Sangma\u2019s tenure as Lok Sabha Speaker is unforgettable. His down to earth personality and affable endeared him to many.\u201d\n\nThe twitter handle Officeof RG tweeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tribute to Mr. Sangma. \u201cDeepest condolences on the passing away of veteran leader and former LS Speaker Shri PA Sangma.
