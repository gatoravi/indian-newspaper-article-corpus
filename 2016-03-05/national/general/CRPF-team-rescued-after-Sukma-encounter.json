The first encounter took place at 11 a.m. yesterday (Thursday). Then there was firing in the afternoon and evening. Our men were hit and most of the injuries took place during the evening firing. Around 16 people could not move (due to injuries), so they stopped in the forest. Since Kistaram is an interior camp, it did not have sufficient forces, so additional forces had to be sent from outside.\u201d\n\nMr. Singh also claimed that the CoBRA team was fired at from the houses of Dabbamarka village.\n\n\u201cBut our men maintained the highest form of distance from the village.
