Vohra and expressed willingness \u201cto form a government only if people\u2019s aspirations are respected\u201d.\n\nShe held an hour-long meeting with the Governor, who has been heading the caretaker government for two months now.\n\n\u201cPolitical issues and various challenges faced by the State on the development and economic fronts were discussed,\u201d said a Raj Bhavan spokesman.\n\n\u201cI am not a stubborn person. It\u2019s a privilege to become Chief Minister and serve the people. I will form the government if people\u2019s aspirations are respected. But if I feel the BJP has nothing other than hollow promises, I will never be ready,\u201d she said in her speech to party leaders and workers in Jammu.\n\nIn an oblique reference to the National Conference and separatists, Ms. Mufti said, \u201cI am not worried about the criticism for going with the BJP.\u201d",
