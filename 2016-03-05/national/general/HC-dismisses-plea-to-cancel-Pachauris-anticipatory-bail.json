Pachauri, who has been chargesheeted in a sexual harassment case, on Friday got a reprieve from the Delhi High Court, which dismissed a petition seeking cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to him by a trial court here last year. The petition was filed by a former TERI research analyst, who is the complainant.\n\nThe 29-year-old woman contended that a free and fair probe could not be carried out if the accused was allowed to move freely.\n\nJustice S.P. Garg of the High Court rejected the complainant's petition, while observing that there was no manifest error in the grant of bail to Mr. Pachauri and the trial court's bail order of March 21 last year was based on \u201cfair appraisal of the materials\u201d. The Judge said the trial court had considered all theaspects of the matter minutely, while the petitioner had failed to show as to for what purpose the custodial interrogation of the accused was required. Stringent conditions have been imposed on him, while safeguarding the interest of the petitioner and that of the investigating agency.\n\nMr. Pachauri said there was nothing on record to suggest that he had influenced witnesses or any other person related to the case or interfered in the probe.\n\nThere was no manifest error in the grant of relief by the trial court: Justice S.P. Garg",
