    "text": "The SaveLIFE Foundation has welcomed the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment making it binding on all States and Union Territories to implement the guidelines notified by the Centre protecting good Samaritans.\n\nHailing the verdict, Piyush Tewari, founder and chief executive officer of SaveLIFE Foundation, said: \u201cThis is a big day for India. The public need not fear any harassment or intimidation for helping an injured person on the road.\u201d Although notified by the Centre, most States were treating the guidelines as merely an advisory. But, now, non-compliance would be treated as contempt of court, making them and the standard operating procedures as good as law.\n\n\u201cThe guidelines will ensure that good Samaritans will not be scared to help people in distress. It will undoubtedly help the Zero Fatality Corridor initiative taken up by Maharashtra,\u201d said R.L. Mopalwar, Managing Director of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, which has partnered with SaveLIFE Foundation to launch a pilot project to make the Mumbai-Pune Expressway a zero fatality corridor.",
