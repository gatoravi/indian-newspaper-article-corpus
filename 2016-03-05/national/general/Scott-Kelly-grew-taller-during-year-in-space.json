    "text": "The change is temporary, say scientists\n\nAstronaut Scott Kelly, who returned on March 1 after spending 340 days on the International Space Station, is now about two inches taller than when he left Earth.\n\nNASA\u2019s Jeff Williams said that gaining height was expected and is temporary, explaining that astronauts get taller in space as the spine elongates, but they return to pre-flight height after a short time back on Earth.\n\nThat means if the 52-year-old astronaut were to stand next to his identical twin, Mark Kelly, he would probably get to gloat.\n\nInterestingly, Scott Kelly is actually a little less than 1/100th of a second younger than he would have been if he stayed on Earth. The explanation for that is to do with Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\n\nIf two objects are moving at different speeds, time runs more quickly for the slower object, a phenomenon called time dilation.\n\nThough he\u2019s no longer an astronaut, Mark Kelly had volunteered to take part in NASA\u2019s \u201cTwins Study\u201d with his brother.\n\nNASA wants to see how the identical twins measure up after a year in two very different environments: Scott in space and Mark on Earth. \u2014 ANI\n\nScott is 1/100th of a second younger than he would have been if he stayed on Earth",
