    "text": "Tobacco farmers on Friday protested against government policies and accused it of discrimination against tobacco growers by imposing punitive taxation and stringent regulations on tobacco products.\n\nProtesting under the banner of Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA), farmers at Jantar Mantar demanded immediate government intervention against the directive on graphic health warnings issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on tobacco packaging. The directive mandates a revision in the size of the existing warning from covering 40 per cent of the front of the pack to 85 per cent of both sides of the pack from April 1, 2016.\n\nShouting slogans in support of their demands, the farmers said due to the onslaught on the cigarette industry, there was an imminent threat to their livelihoods.\n\nFAIFA President B.V. Javare Gowda, addressing the farmers gathering said: \u201cIt's disappointing. While on one hand the government has announced a number of pro-farmer measures in the recent budget, on the other hand the tobacco farmer has been left discriminated, with anti-farmer policies.\u201d\n\nHe said the Indian tobacco industry, which is predominantly \u2018make in India\u2019, is being attacked with rules like 85 per cent graphic health warnings, which have no basis nor supported by data. \u201cWe urge an immediate removal of these rules,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to FAIFA tobacco farming provides livelihood to 45.7 million people comprising farmers, farm labour, workers and retailers in India. India is the second largest exporter of tobacco, earning Rs. 6000 crore.\n\nFarmers fear that the larger graphic health warnings if implemented will further lead to increased growth of illegal and smuggled cigarettes in India.",
