    "text": "India has not issued visas for a delegation of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) that was planning to travel on Friday. For the past several years, India has turned down the request for visas for such annual visits by the USCIRF. \u201cThe goal of the Commission\u2019s trip was to discuss and assess religious freedom conditions in that nation,\u201d the USIRF said in a release.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed by the Indian government\u2019s denial, in effect, of these visas. As a pluralistic, non-sectarian, and democratic state, and a close partner of the United States, India should have the confidence to allow our visit,\u201d Robert P. George, Chairman of USCIRF, a bipartisan body, said.\n\nResponding to the USCIRF, the Indian embassy in Washington said in a statement: \u201cThere is no change in the policy of the Government of India with respect to such visits. India is a vibrant pluralistic society founded on strong democratic principles. The Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens including the right to freedom of religion. We do not see the locus standi of a foreign entity like USCIRF to pass its judgment and comment on the state of Indian citizens\u2019 constitutionally protected rights.\u201d\n\nThe embassy said India looked \u201cforward to continuing working with the United States government for sharing of experience and best practice on all issues of mutual interest under the established bilateral mechanisms like the India-United States Global Issues Forum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe USCIRF will continue to pursue a visit to India, given the ongoing reports from religious communities, and NGOs that the conditions for religious freedom in India have been deteriorating since 2014,\u201d Mr. George said.",
