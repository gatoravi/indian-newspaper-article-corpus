A Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and P.C. Pant issued notice to the CBI on the AAP government's plea, challenging the Delhi High Court decision allowing the probe agency to retain the documents seized during the raids. The High Court had put on hold the trial court\u2019s direction to hand over the seized documents to the Kejriwal government.\n\nThe CBI raided the office of Mr. Kumar and registered a case against him and others alleging \u201che had abused his official position by favouring a particular firm in the last few years in getting tenders from a Delhi government department.\u201d",
