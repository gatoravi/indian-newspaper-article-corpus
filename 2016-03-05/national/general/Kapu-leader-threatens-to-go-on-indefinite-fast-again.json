    "text": "The Kapu reservation issue is showing signs of precipitating into a crisis again with its leader Mudragada Padmanabham announcing his resolve to sit on an indefinite fast from March 11 if the Andhra Pradesh government failed to fulfil the promises made to him last month.\n\n\u201cThe government should release a sum of Rs. 500 crore to the Kapu Corporation immediately and allocate Rs.1,000 crore every year thereafter. It should accept all applications from Kapu youth and provide them loans devoid of involvement of Janmabhoomi committees in processing of the applications,\u201d he said in a press conference at his house in Kirlampudi in East Godavari district on Friday.\n\nMr. Padmanabham said there should not be any delay in the submission of report by Manjunath Commission and that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should give in writing that he will implement all these demands.\n\nAccusing Mr. Naidu of instigating Ministers belonging to the Kapu community to level allegations against him, Mr. Padmanabham said he would reply to all the allegations if the Chief Minister raised them directly.\n\nHitting back at Mr. Padmanabham, Mr. Naidu said the \u201cso-called protagonists\u201d of Kapus\u2019 welfare were raking up the issue to further their own agenda.\n\nMudragada Padmanabham says the CM should give in writing that he would implement all their demands",
