Mr. Bhatia responded that the apex court had limited jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the House.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018limited\u2019 jurisdiction is vast,\u201d Justice Khehar shot back.\n\nThe hearing was based on a petition filed by Supriyo Prasad and others, representing Aaj Tak and India Today TV against the summons directing them to appear before the House Committee on Friday.",
