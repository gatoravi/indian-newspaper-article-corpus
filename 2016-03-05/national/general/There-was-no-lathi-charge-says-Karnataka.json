Parameshwara said all cases registered against farmers and their leaders would be withdrawn. The police had detained 190 people and released them later. Four farmers and six policemen were injured during the protest on the busy airport road. More than 300 people missed their flights due to traffic jam following farmers\u2019 dharna on the Airport road, he said.\n\nHe denied the Opposition\u2019s allegation of lathi-charge against farmers.\n\nIn his reply, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the farmers had resorted to the protest, though he had convened a meeting on March 6 to discuss their issues.\n\nEarlier, accusing the government of being \u201canti-farmer\u201d, the Opposition BJP and the JD (S) condemned the alleged lathi-charge against the famers, who drove to the city from drought-prone districts seeking a permanent solution to drinking water and irrigation crisis.\n\nThe BJP demanded legal action against police officers who ordered a lathi-charge.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition, Jagadish Shettar, demanded a judicial probe into the incident.",
