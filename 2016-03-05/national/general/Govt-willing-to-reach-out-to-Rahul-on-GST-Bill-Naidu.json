Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said the government was willing to reach out to Mr. Gandhi to break the deadlock over the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Hindu , Mr. Naidu said the BJP government had never accused Mr. Gandhi of being the main hurdle in the passage of the GST Bill, saying \u201cit is the media and some political analysts who have said Rahul Gandhi calls the shots in the Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is talking to the Congress leadership in this regard,\u201d said Mr. Naidu. \u201cFinance Minister Arun Jaitley is speaking to Congress interlocutors and I have been in regular touch with their leaders ... we can talk to Rahul Gandhi also.\u201d\n\nCompared to the last two parliamentary sessions that ended in complete washouts, Mr. Naidu said the current one seemed to be on the right track since it was happening in the backdrop of \u201cincreased public and political demand for a productive session.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn various meetings [with the Opposition] convened by me, serious concern was expressed over persistent disruptions,\u201d said Mr. Naidu, adding that leaders of the Opposition were told that the public were getting restive seeing Parliament at a standstill.\n\n\u201cI am sure this will impact the conduct of the parties concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Naidu had no regret over the government\u2019s approach in dealing with the repercussions of Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide at Hyderabad Central University and the police crackdown at Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\n\u201cWe have given effective responses on all these issues,\u201d said Mr. Naidu.\n\n\u201cThe JNU incident raised some serious issues. Universities, the highest seats of learning, are supposed to be the breeding grounds for reason, responsibility and maturity instead of pioneering anti-national activities. This message has effectively gone out in the public domain as a result of some Opposition parties seeking to make a political capital out of it.\u201d\n\nBJP never accused Congress leader\n\nof being hurdle in Bill\u2019s passage, says Union Minister",
