    "text": "Polo players herd the semi-wild poniesonly at the time of tournaments\n\nThe small but efficient Manipuri pony may soon be declared an endangered species like the brow-antlered deer. Both these animals are found only in Manipur. \u201cIn the livestock census conducted in 2012, the population of this pony was found to be 1,100 only,\u201d said State Veterinary Minister Govindas Konthoujam.\n\n\u201cSeventy acres of land has been set aside at Heingang in Imphal east district for setting up a pony sanctuary. A proposal for the sanctuary that will cost Rs.78 crore has been sent to the central government,\u201d he said. But the local people have been objecting to the plan to convert paddy fields to a pony sanctuary and the government is yet to address the issue.\n\nThe state government has drafted a comprehensive Manipur state pony policy, Mr. Konthoujam said.\n\nN. Tombiraj, secretary general of the Manipur Polo Society, said the population of the pony is fast decreasing.\n\n\u201cApart from the dwindling spaces of grazing grounds resulting from rapid urbanisation, the semi-wild pony is not kept at home but let loose. Many of them are seen in the town streets, mostly eating hotel and house garbage stuffed in plastic bags. As such, they are susceptible to deadly diseases and road accidents,\u201d he said.\n\nPolo players herd the ponies only at the time of tournaments.\n\nThe Manipur government had sanctioned Rs. 2 crore some years ago for a pony farm at Tingkhai Khunnou in Senapati district.\n\nFive veterinarians and other workers were posted there. However, officials said the farm was as good as closed down now. Mr. Tombiraj is worried that once the ponies become extinct the polo game, \u201cwhich is Manipur\u2019s gift to the world, will suffer.\u201d \u2014 IANS",
