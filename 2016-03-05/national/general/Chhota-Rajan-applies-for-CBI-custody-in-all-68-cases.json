    "text": "In what is a seemingly bizarre move, arrested gangster Chhota Rajan on Thursday applied to a special court requesting the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take him in custody in all the 68 cases registered against him by various law enforcement agencies.\n\nRajan\u2019s lawyer Avinash Kamkhedekar said the CBI should take him into custody for all the 68 cases in which Non-Bailable Warrants (NBW) have been issued against him. He said, \u201cThis is the best time to take him in custody,\u201d Kamkhedekar said, \u201cas all 68 NBWs can be executed all at once.\u201d\n\nSpecial judge SS Adkar directed the CBI to file its progress report in the J Dey murder case so that the court can decide on how much time is needed to file a report on the crime journalist\u2019s murder in 2011 in which Rajan is the main accused. The gangster, who is alleged to have masterminded the killing on June 11, 2011, was produced via video conferencing.",
