Its report says a \u201cwrong process\u201d was followed in Ms. Singh\u2019s admission in violation of reservation norms.\n\n\u201cThis puts my academic career under threat. I am depressed. The university is harassing me. And I\u2019m beginning to wonder how bad it must have been for Rohith Vemula,\u201d Ms. Singh told The Hindu .\n\nEver since she assumed the post of union president, Ms. Singh has been in the limelight for her fight against gender insensitivity and opposition to some of the ABVP\u2019s decisions, including the cancellation of the visit of hardline BJP MP, Yogi Adityanath to the campus.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m being intimidated\u2019\n\nMs Singh has written many times to Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on the \u201crepeated harassment\u201d by the administration and the alleged inaction against ABVP students who, she alleges, sexually and physically intimidated her.\n\n\u201cThey desperately want to see me removed so that an ABVP student is made president. [Out of five posts in the AUSU, the ABVP holds four, except that of president]. The administration is harassing me by sending unfounded show-cause notices and by constituting baseless enquiry committees against me. Ironically, they never do so when crimes against women are reported on campus,\u201d Ms. Singh said. She claims she was recently threatened with defamation by the varsity for protesting the appointment of an official, accused of harassing a Dalit woman.\n\nDean of Arts A. Satyanarayanan denied the allegation that there was a ploy to cancel Ms Singh\u2019s admission. He, however, said it was found that the \u201cprocess followed in her admission was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe roster principle was applied where it is only meant for promotion and direct recruitment to employment. It seems like a procedural flaw of the administration. There seems no fault of the candidate or the coordinator. There was no evidence of her producing a false certificate,\u201d Mr. Satyanarayan said.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, who is out of station, is expected to take the final call on Ms. Singh\u2019s admission. Ms. Singh contests the varsity\u2019s report saying her admission was effected by \u201ca ruling\u201d of the Allahabad High Court after it sought a \u201clegal opinion\u201d. Professor V.P. Singh, her coordinator in the Centre for Globalization and Development studies, confirmed this.\n\n\u201cThey are questioning my admission two years after I was admitted. Why was no question raised during the scrutiny of papers in the election,\u201d Ms. Singh asked.\n\nABVP student leader Siddharth Singh has criticised Ms. Singh for blaming the outfit and said she should be booked for \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she is correct, why is she reluctant to face a proper probe into her admission? You cannot manipulate the real documents,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior professor, who is aware of the case details, supported Ms. Singh\u2019s cause and said on the condition of anonymity: \u201cWhy is the VC acting merely on the complaint of an M.A. student who has nothing to do with the department? It is a clear case of settling scores.\u201d\n\nMs. Singh said it was a scheme to \u201cdisturb\u201d her and reflected the \u201cpatriarchal attitude\u201d of the administration and the ABVP, who are \u201cnot ready to accept a woman as student union president.\u201d",
