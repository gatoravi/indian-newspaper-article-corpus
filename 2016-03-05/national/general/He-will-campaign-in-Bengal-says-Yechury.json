For the first time, the nation can see the power of the youth of Left.\u201d\n\nMr. Kumar, who hails from a poor family of Bihar, belongs to the All India Students Federation, which is the students\u2019 wing of the CPI, a part of the Left Front.\n\nThe Left has lost part of its once powerful support base in Bengal, which is now under arch-rival All-India Trinamool Congress, and would hope to pull in a slice of sympathy for the charismatic young student leader.\n\nMr. Kumar, however, earned the wrath of the RSS, the BJP\u2019s ideological mentor, which he has lambasted in several speeches.\n\n\u201cThe example of Communists is that of rats. What the High Court has said during Kanhaiya\u2019s release is much more important than what the RSS thinks about him or the Communists,\u201d RSS Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Manmohan Vaidya said.\n\nThe Twitter handle rss.org spewed venom at \u201cthe Communists\u201d on Friday, showing signs of a deepening conflict between the RSS and the Left in the backdrop of the recent incidents at the JNU.",
