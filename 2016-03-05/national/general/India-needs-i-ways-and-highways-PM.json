Radhakrishnan at the launch of the Setu Bharatam project in New Delhi on Friday.\u2014 Photo: PTI\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said here on Friday that the government was putting in all efforts to build infrastructure, especially rural roads, in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\u201cVeins give strength to our body. Similarly, infrastructure will give speed and strength to the development of India. There will be progress if we focus on building road and railway networks, optical fibre network, water, grid and electricity connectivity, along with electricity supply. Our government is working in that direction,\u201d Mr. Modi said while launching the Rs. 50,000 crore Setu Bharatam project. The project aims to make all national highways free from railway level-crossings by 2019 to ensure road safety. Under the project, 208 rail overbridges and underbridges will be built at a cost of Rs. 20,800 crore, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said. Also, 1,500 decade-old bridges will be reconstructed and revamped, spending Rs. 30,000 crore.\n\n\u201cNormally, the governments have an incremental approach. Our effort is to take a quantum jump,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe country, he said, needs both highways and i-ways (information ways), referring to digital connect.\n\nSetu Bharatam project to make all national highways free from railway level crossings",
