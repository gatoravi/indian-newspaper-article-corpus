The police went on to arrest Nimesh Rane (28), a sales manager in connection with the crime.\n\nTheir family members have since been running from pillar to post seeking justice from the police whose work so far, they say, has been shoddy at best.\n\n\u201cEveryone kept telling us on the night of the accident that it was a case of drunk driving. However, the FIR did not mention that anywhere. It was only the next day, when we read the newspapers, that we realised that it was being reported as a simple case of a hit and run accident,\u201d said Surabhi\u2019s aunt Vandana Gore, one of the organisers of Sunday\u2019s peace march.",
