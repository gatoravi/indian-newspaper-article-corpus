The incident was the first of its kind in the State, said Jamuna Varghese, Deputy District Medical Officer, Alappuzha.\n\nThe death, due to attack on the brain of the victim by the disease-causing organism, was classified in the \u201crarest of the rare\u201d category.\n\nWhat is scary is that the circumstances that led to the infection still prevail.\n\nWorld over, only 300 deaths had occurred, Dr. Varghese told The Hindu . Yet, the medical community should be vigilant against the recurrence of the disease.\n\nThe amoeba invades the nervous system through the nasal tissues when water enters nasal cavity during activities such as swimming and bathing. It migrates to the brain and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), according to medical experts.\n\nThe victim had taken a swim in the contaminated canal water at Pallathuruthy here.\n\nThe district medical authorities cautioned people against making use of the water in the canal.\n\nWarm polluted water in canals or ponds is congenial to the growth of the disease-causing organism.\n\nA boy who went for a swim in a canal in Alappuzha died of amoebic encephalitis",
