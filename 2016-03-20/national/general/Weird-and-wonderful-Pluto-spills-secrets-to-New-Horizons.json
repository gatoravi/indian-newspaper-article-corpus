Yet nearby highlands are saturated with impact craters. Welcome to weird and wonderful Pluto, as revealed by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft.\n\nEight months after the probe buzzed past the dwarf planet, mission scientists have published the most detailed studies yet of Pluto\u2019s unexpectedly varied terrain and its motley moons. \u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing how many different geological processes have operated\u201d on Pluto, says Jeffrey Moore, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, and the lead author of one of five New Horizons papers published on Thursday in Science .\n\nOn Sputnik Planum, nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide continually cycle between ice and gas at temperatures of \u2212243 to \u2212223 degrees Celsius. Sputnik Planum\u2019s elevation, 3-4 kilometres below the surrounding uplands, may create conditions that collect these volatile chemicals from Pluto\u2019s thin atmosphere.\n\nThe result is soft glaciers, composed largely of nitrogen ice, that cover a bedrock of much harder water ice and help to keep the plains smooth. Yet this water ice is less dense than the nitrogen, so in some places, chunks of the bedrock float on the glaciers.\n\nOther areas remain in an almost primordial state. The eastern part of the dark area called Cthulhu Regio seems to be saturated with craters. Moore suspects that they were created during the Late Heavy Bombardment 4 billion years ago, when comets and asteroids pummelled the solar system.\n\nThe combination of light, strong water-ice bedrock and softer, flowing glaciers made of about 90% nitrogen creates some strange interactions. Scientists did not think that soft volatile ices could build water ice into mountains several kilometres high \u2014 until they saw Pluto up close. \u201cWhen you lay out all these materials in a large sandbox, weird and wonderful things can happen,\u201d says New Horizons team member Will Grundy, of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, the lead author of a study describing the surfaces of Pluto and Charon.\n\nOther geological oddities arise at the boundaries between different types of terrain. Some highlands near Sputnik Planum are marked by valleys about a kilometre deep, and up to 25 kilometres wide, where glaciers seem to run down to the plains below. The networks of valleys resemble those found on Mars and Saturn\u2019s moon Titan. This surprises Mr. Moore, because conditions on Pluto prevent nitrogen from existing as a fluid that could carve such valleys. Scientists aren\u2019t sure whether heavy nitrogen ice eroded the lighter water ice to create the depressions.\n\nThen there is Pluto\u2019s largest moon, Charon. Mordor Macula, a large, reddish region near the moon\u2019s North pole, does not resemble anything found on the other known icy satellites in the solar system. Mr. Grundy and his colleagues suggest that its striking colour is produced by methane and other volatile chemicals that freeze out of the atmosphere during Charon\u2019s long winters \u2014 when temperatures can dip below \u2212253 degrees Celsius \u2014 and are then converted by sunlight into darker compounds that do not evaporate. The source of the methane is unknown; it may escape from Pluto\u2019s atmosphere and flow toward Charon, or come from Charon\u2019s interior.\n\nTaken together, the findings constitute \u201ca magnificent reconnaissance\u201d of Pluto and its satellites, says Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, who is not involved in the New Horizons mission. \u201cThe iceberg mountains floating in a frozen sea of nitrogen and the bladed terrain are just examples of a quite amazing range of novel features.\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
