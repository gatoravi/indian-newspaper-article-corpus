In Karnataka, 25 per cent of the seats in primary and secondary institutions need to be filled with students from that particular community to be a minority institution.\n\nThis was even as Zafar Agha, member, NCMEI, said that according to the commission, there is no \u201cquota\u201d in minority education institutions. Citing the examples of the Jain, Sikh and Parsi communities, he said it would be difficult for them to fulfil that criterion. He also reiterated that a Supreme Court Constitutional Bench had ruled that the Right to Education (RTE) Act does not apply to minority educational institutions.\n\nAddressing the media after the second regional conference organised by the commission here on Saturday, Ajay Seth, Principal Secretary, Primary and Secondary Education, said there is also a \u201cvacuum in the law\u201d concerning linguistic minority institutions.\n\n\u201cLinguistic minority has not been notified by the Government of India. State governments, including Karnataka, have come up with policies that require these institutions to admit 25 per cent of students from those communities,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe challenge at this point is to ensure that genuine minority institutions get exemption from RTE, and not the ones that want to escape it.\n\nRuling out a review of the existing provisions in the State for minority institutions, Mr. Seth said Karnataka had put them in place after a lot of deliberations. \u201cBut, we will put forth the commission\u2019s view before the government,\u201d he added. Admitting that delay in getting the minority status was an issue raised by institutions during the consultations, Mr. Agha said the commission does not grant minority status directly. \u201cIf the State government does not grant it in 90 days, they can appeal to us with proof. The maximum number of appeals comes from Kerala,\u201d he said.\n\nTerming Karnataka as one of the States that fares well on this count, he also mentioned that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah too had, in his budget speech on Friday, promised to include issuance of minority status under Sakala, which would solve the problem.\n\nState governments, including Karnataka, have come up with policies that require these institutions to admit 25 per cent of students from those communities.\n\nAjay Seth,\n\nPrincipal Secretary, Primary and Secondary Education\n\nAccording\n\nto the commission, there is no quota in minority education institutions.\n\nZafar Agha,\n\nMember, NCMEI",
