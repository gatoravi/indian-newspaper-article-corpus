He asked the commission to take action against the channel.\n\nMr. Narayan, a Ph.D. scholar at the university\u2019s Centre for Law and Governance, wrote: \u201cI would like to bring to your notice and cognisance a deeply problematic, dangerous and defamatory media trial that I have been subjected to over the last one month. I am a Dalit student and have overcome several obstacles to come to JNU to pursue higher education. I have also served as the vice-president of JNUSU in 2014-15 and in this capacity I have been a part of several initiatives to ensure social inclusion and justice in JNU. Since February 9, I have been subjected to slanderous campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to you to take action against this dangerous and irresponsible media reportage,\u201d he added.",
