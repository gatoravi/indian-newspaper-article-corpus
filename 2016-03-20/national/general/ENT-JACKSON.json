The stop-motion film, titled Bubbles , is based on Isaac Adamson\u2019s Black List-topping script and will tell the story of Jackson\u2019s life from the perspective of his chimp, which became his frequent companion in the 1980s. Bubbles was adopted by Jackson from an Austin research facility and given residence at the Neverland Ranch in 1983.\n\nThe chimp was MJ\u2019s frequent companion until it became overaggressive and was moved to a monkey sanctuary in Florida. \u2014 PTI",
