    "text": "The alleged police atrocity against Martin John Challissery of \u2018Oorali,\u2019 a Thrissur-based alternative folk rock band, has drawn widespread protest in Kerala.\n\nMartin is one of the founders and lead singer of Oorali, which has been relentlessly raising its voice for the voiceless.\n\nThe police took Martin into custody from near the School of Drama, Aranattukara, two days ago, while he was on his way to meet a friend.\n\nThough Martin told the police that he was an artiste and musician, they were not convinced and took him to the West police station. Martin alleged that he was abused verbally and physically. \u201cThey had serious problem with my appearance. They suspected that I was a drug addict or peddler, perhaps because of my beard and long hair.\u201d\n\nSocial activist and writer Sara Joseph said judging a person by his appearance was a serious issue. \u201cThe police should update themselves to behave more democratically. The police said Martin had argued with them. Why can\u2019t people argue with the police in a democratic country? \u201d she asked.\n\nAccording to the police, Martin was picked up as part of routine surveillance against drug racket, which is rampant in Lalur and nearby areas.",
