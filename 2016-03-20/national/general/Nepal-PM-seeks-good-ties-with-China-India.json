Sharma Oli, on Saturday said the Himalayan country wanted good relations with both China and India to draw \u201cdevelopmental benefits\u201d for the Nepali economy.\n\n\u201cNepal is smaller in size and has limited resources. We have to benefit also from the developmental activities in the neighbouring countries. We don\u2019t want to fight with any country nor do we want to distance ourselves from any of our neighbours. We are a small country seeking development of our people,\u201d Mr. Oli said in a TV interview which was telecast a on an Indian channel, a day before he is scheduled to embark upon his first visit to China.\n\nMr. Oli defended his policy with India indicating that New Delhi\u2019s lack of support to the Nepali Constitution was due to \u201clack of mutual understanding\u201d which was addressed during his February visit to India.\n\n\u201cSome Indian leaders and ministers were misinformed and misled about the new Nepali Constitution,\u201d Mr. Oli said, defending the statute which has been termed discriminatory by Nepal\u2019s Madhesi population.\n\nHydel projects\n\nPrime Minister Oli also strongly defended Nepal\u2019s rights over water resources and said Nepal will allow hydroelectricity generation if the projects are in \u201cmutual benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not against exploiting our water resources for electricity generation. India, or any other country and companies can exploit rivers for energy generation provided the projects benefit us both,\u201d Mr. Oli said.\n\nMr Oli\u2019s visit to China has been a subject of speculation since he came to power in October 2015. Reports suggest that the visit to China, beginning on March 20, may include landmark agreements on border trade and extradition of wanted criminals.\n\nChina to build fuel depots\n\nOn Saturday, Nepali Minister for Supplies, Ganesh Man Pun declared that Mr Oli\u2019s visit would lead to the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on fuel supply from China.\n\nMr. Pun also announced that the Chinese government would build fuel storage depots in three locations in Nepal for which plans have begun.",
