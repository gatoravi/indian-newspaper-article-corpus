There is fear that the KRS-dependent districts will face a water crisis due to the declining water level in the reservoir.\u2014 Photo: By Special Arrangement\n\nThe Cauvery-dependent districts in the State are likely to face acute shortage of drinking water as the level in the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), constructed across the river near Srirangapatna, dipped to 85.29 ft at 6 a.m. on Saturday. The full-reservoir level (FRL) is 124.8 ft, and the dead storage level 74 ft.\n\nAccording to senior officials of Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (CNNL), the storage in the reservoir stood at 13.31 tmcft as against its maximum capacity of 49.45 tmcft.\n\nThe reservoir had 103 ft of water on the corresponding day last year. The storage was 25.02 tmcft on March 19, 2015.\n\nThe inflow into the KRS was at the rate of 350 cusecs, while the outflow was at the rate of 3,402 cusecs at 6 a.m. on Saturday. Of the outflow quantum, water at the rate of 2,500 cusecs was released to protect the standing crops, CNNL officials said.\n\nMeanwhile, the CNNL has requested the people to use water judiciously. There is no need to panic, as of now, about the drinking water scarcity in KRS-dependent districts. The monsoon is expected to arrive on time this year. In case of late arrival [of monsoon], the Irrigation Department would draw [if necessary] water from Hemavathi reservoir in Hassan to meet the drinking water needs of KRS-dependent districts, a senior CNNL officer told The Hindu on Saturday.\n\nThe reservoir is the lifeline of several districts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.",
