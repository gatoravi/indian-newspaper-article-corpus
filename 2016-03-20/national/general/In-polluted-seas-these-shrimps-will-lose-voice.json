But ocean acidification is jeopardising this process,\u201d Mr. Rossi said.\n\nThe snapping shrimp is the most common and noisiest of the sound-producing marine animals in coastal ecosystems.\n\nThey can produce sounds of up to 210 decibels (dB) through the formation of bubbles by the rapid closing action of their snapping claw, used as a warning sign to scare off predators and in their own hunting.\n\nResearchers measured the sound produced by shrimp in field recordings at natural CO2 volcanic vents at three different ocean locations and under laboratory conditions.\n\nThey found substantial reductions in both the levels of sound produced and in the frequency of snaps.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that this is caused by a change of behaviour rather than any physical impairment of the claw,\u201d said Associate Professor Ivan Nagelkerken.\n\n\u201cSound is one of the most reliable directional cues in the ocean because it can carry up to thousands of kilometres with little change, whereas visual cues and scents are affected by light, water clarity and turbulence,\u201d Mr. Nagelkerken said.\n\n\u201cIf human carbon emissions continue unabated, the resulting ocean acidification will turn our currently lively, noisy reefs into relatively silent habitats,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd given the important role of natural sounds for animals in marine ecosystems, that\u2019s not good news for the health of our oceans,\u201d he added.
