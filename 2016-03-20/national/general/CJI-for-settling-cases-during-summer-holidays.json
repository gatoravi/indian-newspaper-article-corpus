    "text": "Noting that people\u2019s aspiration for justice has increased, Chief Justice of India T. S. Thakur on Saturday suggested hearing and finalisation of cases during the summer holidays, if counsel of both the sides were willing.\n\n\u201cThere is a request that though the courts will be having summer holidays...if the counsel of both parties are willing to take up cases, I will request the Chief Justice of the High Courts to list the cases for hearing...request is also to the judges to hear and finalise them,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the new red and pink sandstone building of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court spread over 40.2 acres here, Justice Thakur noted the sprawling new building was the best gift to the judicial system by the government.\n\n\u201cI am in the habit of visiting courts both in the country and outside and no building, be it the one in London or Washington, is anywhere in comparison to this...It is a matter of pride that the judicial system has got this outstanding gift from the government.\n\n\u201cA heavy sum of Rs. 1,300 crore of the taxpayers money has gone into it and you cannot have any complaint that there is dearth of anything required for providing justice,\u201d he said. - PTI",
