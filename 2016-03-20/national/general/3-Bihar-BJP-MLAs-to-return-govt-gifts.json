Prem Kumar, Mangal Pandey and myself will return the gifts like micro oven to the govt.,\u201d tweeted senior BJP leader and member of the State Council, Sushil Kumar Modi.\n\n\u201cGOB has given the ridiculous justification that Bihar MLAs are poor and will use micro oven to taste Mid Day Meal.

According to their election affidavits, about 67 per cent of them are millionaires.\n\nThere are 51 millionaires among the 80 ruling RJD MLAs.
