It is the role of our student population to create and spread awareness of the problems faced by our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents are an integral part of the social fabric. They must understand the importance of the relationship between themselves as individuals and society as a whole... the main occupation of students is studying. But that does not give them the liberty to isolate themselves from the happenings in the world surrounding them,\u201d he said in Bapu Gujarat Knowledge Village , an educational campus promoted by Congress leader Shankersinh Vaghela.",
