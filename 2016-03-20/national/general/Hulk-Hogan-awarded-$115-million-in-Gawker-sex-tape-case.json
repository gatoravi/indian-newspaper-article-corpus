Just moments after the verdict, Gawker founder Nick Denton said he will appeal, based on evidence that wasn\u2019t introduced in court. Earlier on Friday, in spirited closing arguments, lawyers for Hogan and Gawker discussed themes of personal life versus celebrity and freedom of speech versus the right to privacy.\n\nThey said Hogan didn\u2019t consent to the video, that Gawker didn\u2019t follow usual journalism procedures before posting it and that the video wasn\u2019t newsworthy. \u2014 AP",
