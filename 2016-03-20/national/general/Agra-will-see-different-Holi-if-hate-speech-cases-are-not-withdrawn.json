An FIR was filed against Kundanika Sharma of the BJP and Ashok Lavania and Shashank Chaudhary of the VHP under Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nHowever, the local administration is widely seen as not taking action on the hate speech case. The police declared that the leaders were \u201cabsconding,\u201d whereas they were reportedly present on the same stage from where the ADM, Agra, Rajesh Shrivastav, addressed the protesters.\n\nMr. Shrivastav assured the protesters that besides higher compensation, Mahaur's family would get a government house and government pension \u2014 an arrangement which is close to the demand made by the BJP and the sangh parivar that Mahaur should get a compensation package similar to Mohammad Akhlaq who was lynched over rumours about beef in October last year in Dadri.\n\nThe fact that the State government fulfilled one of the main demands of the sangh parivar and slapped the stringent National Security Act on Shahrukh, accused in Mahaur's murder, is believed to have made the Hindutva groups soften their threats of a huge protest in Agra this week.\n\nRamshanker Katheria gives the U.P. government\n\n15 days to meet the demand",
