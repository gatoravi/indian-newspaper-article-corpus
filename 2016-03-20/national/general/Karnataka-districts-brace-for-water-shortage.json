The full-reservoir level (FRL) of KRS is 124.8 ft. The dead storage level is 74 ft.\n\nAccording to senior officials of the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (CNNL), the storage in the reservoir stood at just 13.31 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) as against its maximum capacity of 49.45 tmcft. The reservoir had 103 ft. of water on the corresponding day last year. The storage was 25.02 tmcft on March 19, 2015.\n\nThe inflow into the KRS was 350 cubic feet per second (cusecs), while the outflow was 3,402 cusecs at 6 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nOf the outflow quantum, over 2,500 cusecs of water are released to protect the standing crops, CNNL officials said. Meanwhile, the CNNL has requested the people to use water judiciously.\n\nLifeline\n\nThere is no need to panic as of now, officials said about the drinking water scarcity in KRS-dependent districts. The monsoon is expected to arrive on time this year. In case of late arrival [of monsoon], the Irrigation Department would draw water, if necessary, from the Hemavathi reservoir in Hassan to meet the drinking water needs of districts dependent on Cauvery, a senior CNNL officer told The Hindu . The reservoir is the lifeline of several districts in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\n\nIt supplies water to Bengaluru, Mysuru, parts of Bengaluru Rural, Mandya and Ramanagaram districts of Karnataka.",
