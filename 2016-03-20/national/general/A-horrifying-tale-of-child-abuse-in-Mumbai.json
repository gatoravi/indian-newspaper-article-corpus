    "text": "Ten years ago, Anita (name changed) was a five-year-old without many worries. Today, at 15, she lives in a Children\u2019s Home in Govandi with no one to call her own, after her mother made her register a complaint of sexual assault against her father to settle a personal score.\n\nAnita\u2019s parents were divorced in 2007, and the court granted her custody to her mother. She would visit her father occasionally, and her association with her father angered her mother a lot.\n\nAnita\u2019s plight came to light earlier this month when the Parksite police were investigating the complaint of rape and learnt that it was fake. Police officials said Anita went missing from her aunt\u2019s house in Vikhroli in Mumbai\u2019s eastern suburbs on January 14 this year. Her aunt and her mother approached the police, and a case of kidnapping was registered against unknown persons, as is the rule for missing minors.\n\nFour days later, on January 19, her father brought her home safe and sound. He told the police that she had come to stay with him as she was missing him. The father and daughter stayed at his house in Ahmednagar. The police recorded his statement as well as Anita\u2019s and, for all purposes, the case was closed.\n\nHowever, on January 28, Anita\u2019s mother brought her back to the police station and Anita told the police that her father, as well as another man, who she did not know, had sexually abused her during the four days that she had spent at his residence. The police registered a complaint of molestation under the Indian Penal Code as well as sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), and sent a team to her father\u2019s residence in Ahmednagar near Pune.\n\n\u201cWe found her jewellery at her father\u2019s house, as well as some of her clothes in the farm, which was in keeping with the victim\u2019s narration of the offence. However, we found her overall demeanour suspicious,\u201d said an officer with the Parksite police station.\n\nGives in to pressure\n\nFinally, after repeated and gentle cajoling, Anita broke down and told them the truth. She said that after she ran away to stay with her father, her mother had decided to end her association with him once and for all. She was allegedly beaten and tortured till she agreed to file a false complaint against her father.\n\nFollowing the revelation, the CWC directed the Mumbai police to register an FIR against Anita\u2019s mother, her friend and her aunt.\n\nGirl\u2019s mother made her file complaint of sexual assault against her father to settle scores",
