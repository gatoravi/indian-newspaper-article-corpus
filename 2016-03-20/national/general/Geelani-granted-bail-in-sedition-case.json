Geelani had raised anti-India slogans at the event.\n\nA day after the Jawaharlal Nehru University students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were released on interim bail, a Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to the former Delhi University lecturer S.A.R. Geelani, arrested on sedition charges in connection with a controversial event organised at Press Club of India here on February 10.\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge Deepak Garg, who granted the bail, said there was no evidence to prove that the academic had raised anti-India slogans at the event.\n\nThe court released Mr. Geelani on bail on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs.50,000 and one surety of the like amount.\n\nA magistrate court on February 19 dismissed the bail application of Mr. Geelani, who was arrested on February 16.\n\nThe Delhi police opposed the bail plea in the sessions court, saying holding of the event amounted to contempt of court.\n\nThe prosecution said Mr. Geelani and other participants in the event were celebrating Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhat, who were convicted by the Supreme Court and given the death sentence.\n\nMr. Geelani\u2019s counsel Satish Tamta pointed out that the first information report registered in connection with the event had stated that the Press Club office-bearers had asked the people raising slogans to desist from it and leave the venue, which they did.\n\nCounsel said there was nothing on record to prove that Mr. Geelani had raised anti-India slogans or asked others to do so.",
