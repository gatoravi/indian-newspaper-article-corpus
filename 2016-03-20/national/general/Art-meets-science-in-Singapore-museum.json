Now technology has opened new opportunities for artists to stretch their imagination,\u201d said Fujiwara Tetsuya, managing director, Panasonic System Solutions.\n\nPanasonic in Asia Pacific partnered with the Singaporean ArtScience Museum and teamLab, a Japanese art and technology collective, to create the earth-inspired exhibit, EFE news reported.\n\nThe 1,500 sq.m. exhibitunder the first theme \u201cNature\u201d invites visitors to explore rooms where flowers bloom and die and butterflies flutter in interweaving pixels on gallery walls.\n\nUsing teamLab\u2019s interactive 4D vision technology \u201cvisitors experience the universe from within it, as it surrounds, enfolds them and responds to their presence, thus helping visitors understand themselves as part of the vastness of celestial space,\u201d said teamLab.\n\nThe second concept, \u201cTown\u201d, reflects a cityscape.\n\nIt invites visitors to populate towns by inputting digital data, watching cities grow and physically build and construct architecture with fibreglass light cubes. Finally, the crystal universe of \u201cSpace\u201d transports viewers into a darkened galaxy with star-studded skies, with over 170,000 LED lights used to light up the re-creation of the universe. \u2014 IANS",
