    "text": "Congress leaders cried foul over what they termed a systematic attempt by the BJP to topple governments headed by the party in various States. \u201cThe duo of Modi and Shah is infamous for forcible eviction of elected governments. Elected governments are being destabilised by a sinister conspiracy. After Arunachal Pradesh, it is Uttarakhand,\u201d All India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said.\n\nHe said the BJP was resorting to such actions in the backdrop of its debacle in the Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls, which \u201cconvinced\u201d the party that it would not come to power in any State through a popular vote. The BJP dismissed the allegations. \u201cIf the Congress cannot keep its flock together, it is not the fault of the BJP,\u201d Minister for Telecommunications Ravi Shankar Prasad said.\n\nKharge slams BJP\n\nMeanwhile, Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge in Kalaburagi has termed the political developments in the Congress-ruled Uttarakhand as yet another naked move by the BJP to destabilise the legitimately elected government by targeting the disgruntled legislators through inducement and other unlawful means.\n\nHe said that a frustrated BJP after its drubbing in the Bihar and subsequent byelections and obvious of the party\u2019s likely defeat in the Assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala, and Assam was indulging in undemocratic acts and this had continued after Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and now in Uttarakhand.\n\n\u201cTheir next target is Himachal Pradesh\u201d. Mr. Kharge said that this only exhibited the fascist mindset of the BJP which did not tolerate the Opposition-ruled States.\n\n(With additional reporting by T.V. Sivanandan in Kalaburagi)",
