    "text": "The YSR Congress has decided to boycott the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly on Monday when the House is expected to take up discussion on the interim order of the High Court of Judicature staying the suspension of party MLA R.K. Roja.\n\nOpposition leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the House was trying to belittle the judiciary by allowing a discussion on the court order. The ruling TDP was acting against the judiciary and lowering its prestige.\n\nMr. Jagan led his MLAs in staging a march to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s statue at Tank Bund from the Legislative Assembly in protest against the ruling party\u2019s decision not to allow Ms. Roja into the Assembly precincts. He said his party had filed a contempt petition against the ruling party and Assembly Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao for not honouring the court\u2019s order. The petition was likely to come up for hearing on Monday.\n\nHe also questioned the Speaker\u2019s claim that Ms. Roja\u2019s suspension was a unanimous decision of the House. \u201cHow can the decision be unanimous when the House did not give opportunity to the 67 members of the main Opposition who objected to the suspension,\u201d he wondered.\n\n\u201cChief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has no courage to ask these MLAs to resign and seek public mandate afresh. He is using the Speaker\u2019s office to protect these legislators from facing disqualification,\u201d he said.\n\nYSRC to boycott House on Monday, questions Speaker\u2019s claim of \u2018unanimous resolution\u2019",
