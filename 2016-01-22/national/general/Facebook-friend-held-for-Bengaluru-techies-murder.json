In a fit of rage, Sukhbir attacked Kusum with a pen, stabbing her on the eyebrow, and strangled her to death using a laptop charger, police said. Sukhbir took her credit and debit card, mobile phone and cheque book before escaping.\n\nAdditional Commissioner of Police P. Harishekharan who supervised the investigations said after the murder came to light on Wednesday, the police obtained CCTV footage and cross checked his picture with the Facebook account.\n\nSukhbir met Kusum on Facebook in December 2015. He had seen her profile on a matrimonial website and sent a request on December 31 that Kusum accepted. On January 9, they exchanged their phone numbers and started talking to each other.",
