He was arrested in October 2015 in Tamil Nadu after he threatened to blow up Christian Medical College, Vellore.\n\nAccording to documents with Vellore Police, Ali hails from Tripura. \u201cHe might have acquired a false domicile certificate. We are checking it,\u201d Mr Singh said.\n\nAccording to police sources, Ahmed might be a Bangladeshi, who obtained Tripura\u2019s domicile certificate unlawfully.\n\nMeanwhile, the police have launched a massive manhunt to nab Ahmed, the SP added. -- PTI",
