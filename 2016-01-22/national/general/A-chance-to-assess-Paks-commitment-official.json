The first round of dialogue between the Foreign Secretaries will provide us an opportunity to evaluate Pakistan\u2019s anti-terror commitment,\u201d said the official.\n\n\u201cThere will be no dilution of the agenda or de-linking of any issue from the previously decided agenda of the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue,\u201d said the official.",
