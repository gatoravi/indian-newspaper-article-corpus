    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting of his Council of Ministers for January 27, a day after Republic Day to seek a review of all decisions taken by the Cabinet, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in the last one-and-a-half years of the NDA government.\n\n\u201cThe agenda circulated has only one item, and it seems to be a mid-term review of sorts for the government,\u201d said a top source. At the end of 2016, the government will be half-way through its five-year term, and this year is being seen as a make-or-break one to deliver on governance and the economy.\n\nGroup of secretaries\n\nMr. Modi had earlier set up eight groups of secretaries to suggest innovative ideas to implement the government\u2019s programmes, and this too is being seen as a way to keep his team on its toes. The agenda has set off speculation that there could be a Cabinet reshuffle during the winter session of the budget session of Parliament.\n\n\u201cPolitically already it was being said States like Bihar were over-represented in the Council of Ministers, and now that elections are due in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, one can expect to see some additions from that State,\u201d said a senior office-bearer of the BJP.\n\nSources had earlier confirmed to The Hindu that Mr. Modi would reach out to the Opposition after Republic Day to clear certain Bills, barring the Goods and Services Tax Bill, in the budget session. These include the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill, 2015, and the Benami Transactions Prohibition (Amendment) Bill, 2015.\n\nThe agenda has set off speculation that a Cabinet reshuffle could take place soon",
