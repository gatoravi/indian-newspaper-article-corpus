Muralidhar Rao hit out on Twitter at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his Hyderabad visit in the wake of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide.\n\n\u201cWhy Rahul Gandhi and other leaders have not met Susheel (ABVP president at the university), who was badly beaten [up], before reaching conclusions?\u201d he asked on Wednesday, while answering questions on the issue from twitterati.\n\n\u201cGoing to Malda, Kashmir, Pathankot were not priority for Rahul Gandhi. People should know for whom Congress stands.\u201d\n\nUltra-left forums\n\n\u201cWhy are Congress and Leftists in support of beef festivals in campuses, but not for Indian festivals,\u201d he said, accusing forums like Ambedkar Students Association of being forums of the ultra-left.\n\n\u201cAnti-national activities supporting violence should be dealt with iron hands. No scope for supporters of terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Rao claimed that the BJP needed no \u201ccertificate\u201d for its commitment to Dalits.\n\n\u201cLondon Memorial, PM\u2019s special drive for Dalit entrepreneurship are evidence for BJP\u2019s commitment for Dalit empowerment,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cBJP\u2019s support for Dalit cause and respect for Ambedkar does not need certificate of anyone. Sashakt BJP, Sashakt Dalit (strong BJP, strong Dalits).\u201d",
