Susheela, bedridden for six years, has vague memories of her last meeting with her cousin and celebrated dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai, who died on Thursday. \u201cSeveral years have passed and I am unable to recollect the exact date,\u201d she said. \u201cIn May 2011, Mrinalini visited our ancestral home for two days as part of an all-Kerala tour. A group of film and theatre activists from Ahmedabad had accompanied her. They filmed her moving around in the paddy field and areas close to the village temple,\u201d recalled Mrinalini\u2019s cousin Malini Achuthan, 86.\n\n\u201cAlthough she was born and brought up outside Kerala, Mrinalini had strong affection for Anakkara and the 120-year-old Vadakkath Tharavadu,\u201d said Malini.\n\nSusheela, who underwent two years of imprisonment at the Vellore Central Jail for taking part in the Quit India Movement, shared a rare camaraderie with Mrinalini. \u201cMrinalini had a lot of energy. She wrote several books, apart from devoting herself to promoting classical dance.\u201d\n\nVadakkathu Tharavadu has given birth to illustrious persons such as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal, who led the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in the Indian National Army. Captain Lakshmi, who died at the age of 97 three years ago, was Mrinalini\u2019s sister.",
