The SPG has sought exemption from the ban.\n\n\u201cWhy is it necessary that the SPG should have diesel vehicles... Why can't you use petrol vehicles?\u201d a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur asked Additional Solicitor-General Pinky Anand.\n\nMs. Anand explained that these vehicles were custom-made, armoured and weighed \u201calmost semi-tanks.\u201d They came in diesel and not petrol.\n\nThe court then asked how many do the SPG protect. To this, Ms. Anand said it provided security to the former Prime Ministers, their families, the Prime Minister and very few other people.\n\nThe court remained non-commital on the issue though Ms. Anand pressed urgency. The Bench refer-red the SPG application to senior advocate and its amicus curiae Harish Salve for his opinion.",
