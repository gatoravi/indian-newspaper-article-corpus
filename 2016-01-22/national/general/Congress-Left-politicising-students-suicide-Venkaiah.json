The Congress and Left parties are trying to politicise the suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad University, Union Minister for Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs M. Venkaiah Naidu has said\n\nAddressing mediapersons here on Thursday, he said Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani had not done anything unusual.\n\nShe had only forwarded a memorandum which she had received to the authorities concerned. Earlier when there were similar instances none of the Congress or CPI(M) leaders had visited the campuses, he said.\n\nAsked whether Ms. Irani would visit the campus, Mr. Naidu said that the government was seized of the issue. The government would think of it once the issue settles down.\n\nAll universities, including the Mahatma Gandhi University here, have some issues. But the issue in Hyderabad is being blown out of proportion, he said.\n\nAsked about the debate over the growing religious intolerance in the country, Mr. Naidu said that it was the Congress and the CPI(M) which were intolerant over the Lok Sabha election verdict which returned the BJP to power and rejected both the parties. They were impeding development by obstructing the passage of the GST and Real Estate Bills. He accused the Congress and CPI(M) of working in mutual understanding in Kerala and West Bengal. He asked the leaders of both parties to explain their stance towards each other in Kerala.\n\nIssue in Hyderabad University is being blown out of proportion, says\n\nthe Minister.",
