Golwalkar himself, in his first book, quotes Western thinkers,\u201d he said, adding that the Western thoughts were mixed with \u201cthe Hindu idea of \u2018sanskar\u2019 and \u2018sanskritisation\u2019 and the \u2018guru shishya parampara\u2019 practised in the Shakhas.\u201d\n\nReferring to the recent suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula, he said the majority in India continued to be divided along caste lines.",
