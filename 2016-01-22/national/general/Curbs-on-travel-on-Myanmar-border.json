This will lead to a radical shift in India\u2019s policy towards Myanmar, a friendly country, with which it shares unfenced borders and unhindered movement of people across the border.\n\nBased on a high-level committee report submitted by Joint Intelligence Committee chief R.N Ravi, the government is all set to change the \u201cmisnomer\u201d related to \u201cfree border movement\u201d and will try to replicate the model prevalent along the Bangladesh border. The report has suggested dedicated crossing points in border villages, where policemen would be in charge of regulating the movement of people. \u201cThe movement of people will not be curtailed, as they have strong social and cultural ties across the border, but instead it will be regulated. Every citizen would need to have an identity proof like a passport,\u201d said a senior official.\n\nThis is to send out a strong message that the border be no longer used for extremist activities",
