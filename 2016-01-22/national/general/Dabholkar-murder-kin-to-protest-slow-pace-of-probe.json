    "text": "Disappointed with the slow pace of investigation into the murder of rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar, his kin is set to stage an agitation in New Delhi next month, seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s personal intervention in the probe to hasten the process.\n\nHis family is also demanding the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Dr Dabholkar, 65, was shot dead on August 20, 2013 by two motorcycle-borne youth while on his morning walk on Omkareshwar Bridge in Pune. The CBI took over the case in May 2014.\n\nThe CBI probe, however, has yielded little. Despite sketches of probably suspects being released, there hasn\u2019t been a single arrest.\n\n\u201cIt has been 29 months since the murder and there is still no progress in the case. We have written to the Prime Minister requesting that an IPS-level investigation officer be appointed for the probe, in addition to appointing an officer at the level of joint director CBI to monitor the investigation,\u201d said Hamid Dabholkar, Dr Dabholkar\u2019s son.",
