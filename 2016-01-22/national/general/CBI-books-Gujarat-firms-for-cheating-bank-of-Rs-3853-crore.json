    "text": "The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy against two Gujarat-based private firms and others for allegedly causing a loss of Rs. 38.53 crore to the Union Bank of India.\n\n\u201cIt has been alleged that CRF Logistics Pvt. Ltd, which is located in Anand, represented by its two directors Deepak Shah and Jagadish Shah, entered into a conspiracy with Rajesh Sharma, proprietor of Rishita Auto-craft, Sabarkantha, Gujarat, to cheat the bank,\u201d said a CBI official.\n\nThe accused obtained credit facilities from the bank for Rs. 55.81 crore for purchase of 125 trucks from a supplier company and to get PUF insulated refrigerated container fixed on the chassis from the Sabarkantha-based firm. However, the company directors allegedly took delivery of only 25 trucks.\n\nThough the differential amount for 100 trucks, about Rs. 14.81 crore was refunded by the supplier to the bank, the amount disbursed to Rishita Auto-craft was allegedly outstanding.\n\nAccording to the CBI, the accused persons, without ensuring the end use of the loan had allegedly diverted the funds, thereby causing a loss of about Rs. 38.53 crore to the bank.",
