    "text": "The ninth edition of the Zee Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) began on Thursday with much fanfare as novelist, poet and literary critic Margaret Atwood spoke about the \u201cpower\u201d and \u201coptimism\u201d of words and literature.\n\nMs. Atwood, who delivered the keynote address at JLF, said, \u201cWriting is a very optimistic art. It is a way in which the unknown, the obscure, the undervalued and the neglected can become known. Not much money is needed to write, only time and determination.\u201d\n\nShe said there were \u201cmany darknesses\u201d in the world that portray themselves through poverty, discrimination and oppressive regimes, but there are as many voices to dissent the \u201cdarknesses.\u201d \u201cThere are many darknesses, but there are also many voices,\u201d Ms. Atwood said, calling it an \u201coptimistic thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people believe that reading is diminishing. I dispute that thought,\u201d said Ms. Atwood.\n\nAccording to her, reading was increasing and it was only the platforms to read that were changing.\n\n\u201cIn places with no library, no accessibility to books, or no school there\u2019s probably a cell phone. People can use cell phones, and read and write stories,\u201d she said.",
