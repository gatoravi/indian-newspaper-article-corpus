Susheel Kumar, who has been accused of abetting the suicide of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, on Thursday demanded a fair inquiry into the reason for the death.\n\nAt a press conference here, Mr. Susheel Kumar said Rohith was not a weak person to have lost his heart at suspension, and said there could have been \u201cpersonal and particular\u201d reasons.\n\nHe questioned how Rohith\u2019s fellow scholars failed to identify suicidal tendencies despite keeping him company for 15 days.\n\nReasserting his claim of having been attacked by Ambedkar Students\u2019 Association (ASA) members, Mr. Susheel Kumar said he was forced by a mob of 40 students to write an apology and upload it on Facebook. It was in breach of his freedom of expression, he said.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I deactivated my account, and called my brother to come and take me to hospital. Noticing that I had deactivated my account, about 40 people from the ASA tried to mob me again,\u201d he said and charged them with abusing his mother and trying to attack her inside the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s office.\n\nThe two-page hospital summary, of which he produced a page, spoke of \u201cblunt trauma to abdomen\u201d with appendicitis, and a contusion on the left shoulder, which he admitted to have sustained when ASA members forced him out of the university\u2019s security vehicle. Though two guards were present at the scene controlling the mob, they could not notice him being beaten up, he said.\n\nMr. Susheel Kumar could still produce \u201ceyewitnesses\u201d before the Proctorial Board whose credentials he refused to mention except that they were not from the ABVP. While he produced the footage of his mother\u2019s visit to the V-C\u2019s office before the media, there was no evidence of any attack or abuse therein.\n\nThe ABVP demanded a CBI enquiry and analysis of the phone data of the other four students whose hand they suspected in the suicide, and \u201c40 professors,\u201d who allegedly instigated \u201canti-national\u201d activities within the campus.\n\nProminently naming academics Kancha Ilaiah and G. Haragopal, apart from Vara Vara Rao from the Revolutionary Writers\u2019 Association (ViRaSam), an ABVP spokesperson charged them with \u201cmisguiding\u201d the students and \u201cthrusting guns into their hands instead of pens\u201d.\n\nMr. Susheel Kumar and the ABVP criticised the visits by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury as attempts to politicise an unfortunate death on the campus.\n\nThese leaders were using the opportunity in view of the elections in Assam and to the GHMC, the ABVP said.",
