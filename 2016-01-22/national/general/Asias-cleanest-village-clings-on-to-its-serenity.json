But the accolades have brought several downsides.\n\n\u201cNow there is noise pollution. I\u2019ve talked to the village council which has written to the government to build a new parking lot further away.\u201d said Rishot Khongthohrem, 51, a guesthouse owner.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more privacy. Social bond which binds the village together is disintegrating,\u201d he said.Mawlynnong\u2019s concern for hygiene emerged about 130 years ago when an outbreak of cholera struck.\n\nWith no medical facilities in the village, cleanliness was seen as vital to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nThe village has even been hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an autumn radio address imploring Indians to erase the poor national image of rubbish-strewn highways and monuments under his Clean India campaign. \u201cI was amazed to know that there is such a village in remote northeast, Meghalaya, which is so passionately carrying the mission of cleanliness for years,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the pristine village is proud of its achievements, some believe it must limit visitor numbers to protect the well-being of its inhabitants.\n\n\u201cThey must learn to regulate the number of tourists and to say no at some point,\u201d tourism expert Laloo said. \u2014 AFP\n\nMawlynnong in the northeast is famous for its exceptional cleanliness and has been hailed by PM",
