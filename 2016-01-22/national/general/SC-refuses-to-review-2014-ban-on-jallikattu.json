    "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday declined three petitions filed by private individuals to review its May 7, 2014 judgment banning jallikattu (bull-taming sport) as an inherently cruel act.\n\nIn a decision taken in their chambers, a Bench of Justices V. Gopala Gowda and P.C. Ghose refused to entertain the review petitions in line with the court\u2019s recent order to stay a January 7, 2016 government notification allowing the sport.\n\nThe petitioners were Arulmigu Muppillisamy Temple, Tamil Nadu Parampariya Veera Vilayattu Mattu Vandi Kaalaigal State Welfare Association and J.K. Ritheesh from Tamil Nadu.\n\nHowever, Tamil Nadu\u2019s review petition, filed on May 19, 2014, is still pending.",
