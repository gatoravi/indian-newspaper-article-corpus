They [the ruling coalition] are anti-Dalit and hence their attitude and mindset need to be exposed,\u201d Congress Legislature Party leader Charanjit Singh Channi told The Hindu .\n\nHe said Congress workers were reaching out to the people in all constituencies, highlighting the \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against the Dalits. \u201cOn February 15 and 16, we are organising a seminar in Ludhiana on issues facing the Dalits. Dalit leaders from across the State have been invited to discuss the issues.\u201d\n\nThough the Dalits accounted for nearly 34 per cent of the State\u2019s population, their condition was miserable because of the government\u2019s apathy, he said. \u201cThe government is depriving them of benefits of government schemes meant for them.\u201d Furthermore, the State was not releasing funds for scholarship.\n\nCongress campaign committee vice-chairman Sadhu Singh said the State government was not filling the vacancies meant for the Schedule Castes. \u201cCases of atrocities against Dalits have increased sharply,\u201d he said.",
