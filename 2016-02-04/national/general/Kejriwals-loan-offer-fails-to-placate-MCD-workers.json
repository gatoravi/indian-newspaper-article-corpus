The strike will continue, the unions said.\n\nSpeaking via video conferencing from Bengaluru, the Chief Minister said the Delhi government was able to arrange the amount with \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d as it faced a shortfall of an estimated Rs. 3,000 crore in its projected collections from VAT.\n\nMr. Kejriwal said his government\u2019s intent to disburse the amount which was arranged by diverting funds earmarked for the Education Department would further delay infrastructural expansion.",
