    "text": "The State police, which has faced flak in the past for poor handling of communal rights, has been directed to deal with religious extremism \u2018in the strictest possible manner.\u2019 Individuals and organisations disturbing communal harmony, spreading propaganda on social websites and services, \u2018must be dealt with strongly.\u2019 The cops have been told to identify and reduce any feeling of communalism within the force and \u2018reach out to the minority community and win their hearts at all costs.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe plan aims to create an environment of solidarity and trust among the minority, and envisages different departments undertaking various schemes to reach out to the minority, implement a scheme a year, while setting aside 15% of their funds for the same,\u201d Minister of State for Home Ranjit Patil told The Hindu .\n\nAs per the government resolution on \u2018deradicalisation of youth and preserving communal amity\u2019, the State Education Department will launch a mid-day meal scheme in Urdu schools, provide textbooks at subsidised rates, and teach Urdu as optional subject in 300 Marathi shalas (schools). Muslim scholars have already criticised the efforts to label the community as radicalised.\n\n\u201cThis is an idea borrowed from the West. The use of word deradicalisation itself is like telling them [minority] they are already radicalised, and starts the whole thing on a negative note. If the government wishes, it could propose a development programme for the minority on the lines of schemes it has for SCs/STs. It all depends on the government\u2019s intention. If done with the right intention there is no problem in even introducing Vyayam Shalas and NCC training,\u201d said Professor Abdul Shaban of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences .",
