    "text": "Zika virus is transmitted through an Aedes mosquito, which also causes dengue and chikungunya. The World Health Organisation has reported 22 countries and territories in the Americas from where the transmission of the virus has been reported.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of the company, said the two candidates were in an advanced stage of development and could be ready soon.\n\n\u201cIn the coming two weeks, we will be able to start animal tests of one of the two candidates. Since this is a pandemic situation, we are hoping that the Indian government will move quickly and give approvals for the trials,\u201d he said.\n\nBharat Biotech submitted necessary information to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) four days ago. The company is now planning to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s help in expediting regulatory clearances. \u201cWhen Ebola vaccine candidates were being discussed, the company skipped Phase-II trials and went on to Phase-III with a small sample size. Given the urgency of the situation, something of that sort will be required,\u201d Dr. Ella said.\n\nAt present, getting regulatory approvals for conducting clinical trials can take up to 6-8 months.\n\nBharat Biotech filed patents for both candidates in July 2015, Dr. Ella said. Since the company had already worked on chikungunya, this was the next logical step.\n\n\u201cAt the time we started working on the Zika vaccine, there was not a market incentive or any demand for it, largely because the symptoms are mild. But we were already working on chukungunya, and our hypothesis was that the same vector transmitted this disease, so we thought we needed to look at this aspect as well,\u201d he added.",
