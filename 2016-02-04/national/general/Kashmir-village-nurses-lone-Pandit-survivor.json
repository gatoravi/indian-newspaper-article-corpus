A whole village has taken up the task of tending to the widow of 90-year-old Janki Nath, the lone Pandit survivor in the village, after his demise recently.\n\nResidents of Malvan, the Naths were known for not fleeing the place at the peak of raging violence in 1990s and staying put with the Muslim brethren. The lone daughter of the couple was married off in Jammu and presently lives there.\n\n\u201cI used to take suggestions from him before taking any step in life,\u201d said Gull Mohammad Alai, a local.\n\nWith no Hindu Pandits around, Muslims of the village took it on themselves to perform the final rites as per Hindu customs.\n\n\u201cHe was like family. He deserved the cremation as per the customs,\u201d said Ghulam Hassan, another neighbour.\n\nBed-ridden for five years, Nath, who was a retired employee of the Irrigation Department, breathed his last on Saturday morning. A local youth, Sajad Ahmad, used to nurse the ailing Pandit on a daily basis. When Nath died, except for his aging wife, there was no one else from the family around.\n\n\u201cI will never leave this place. This is my home and I will die here. I live in a family so there\u2019s need not to worry about anything,\u201d said the mourning wife.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about food, clothes and help here. The whole Muslim village is only a shout away,\u201d she said.",
