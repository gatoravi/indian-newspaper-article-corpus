She posted photos showing row after row of empty seats on the China Southern plane as it flew from Wuhan. The flight was delayed for 10 hours, and other passengers departed on earlier flights, leaving Zhang to enjoy personalised attention from the plane\u2019s crew.\n\nThe experience was \u201ctuhao,\u201d she said on her social media feed, using a slang term for the nouveau riche.\n\nChina Southern schedules show the flight is normally operated using a Boeing 737-700 aircraft, which generally seats 137 passengers. Statistics on website Flightradar24 show that a China Southern flight from Wuhan to Guangzhou on Monday was due to leave at 0640 GMT, but did not do until 1639 GMT.\n\nThe huge movement of Chinese travelling home to spend the Lunar New Year with their families is often described as the world\u2019s largest human migration and overcrowded planes, trains and automobiles are the norm.\n\nMany on social media envied Zhang\u2019s good luck in avoiding the enormous crowds. \u201cWhat a fluke that you went against the big New Year's current,\u201d one comment said, noting that the plane will be completely full on its flight back from Guangzhou, a prosperous city that attracts many economic migrants.\n\nOver the last several days, tens of thousands have been stranded at the city\u2019s trains stations due to weather conditions. But one commenter saw the glass half-empty: \u201cEven under these conditions, they still didn\u2019t upgrade you?\u201d \u2014 AFP",
