    "text": "It was a day of disappointment for over 900 tribal and Dalit families here and in surrounding villages at Perumatti and Pattanchery after the Union Home Ministry confirmed on Tuesday that the President had sent back the Plachimada Coca Cola Victims Relief and Compensation Claims Special Tribunal Bill, which was passed unanimously by the Kerala Assembly in 2011. No reason was cited.\n\nThe Bill was passed to ensure that villagers are recompensed for the severe exploitation of groundwater resources and destruction of livelihood by Coca Cola.\n\nApart from making available Rs. 216 crore compensation from Coca Cola for crippling life at Perumatty, the Bill had provisions for initiating action against the company for draining groundwater. It had provisions to prosecute the company\u2019s top executives under the law on prevention of atrocities against Dalits and tribal people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty of justice. The Ministry had so far tried not to forward the Bill to the President raising unreasonable objections. Now it says the Bill has been returned by the President without citing any reason,\u201d said Vilayodi Venugopal, chairman of the Plachimada Samara Samithy.\n\nPresident returns Bill passed by Assembly seeking compensation from Coca Cola",
