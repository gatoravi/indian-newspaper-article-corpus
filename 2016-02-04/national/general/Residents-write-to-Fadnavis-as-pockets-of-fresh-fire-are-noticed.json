    "text": "Breathing toxic smoke for the seventh day in a row, residents of Deonar and surrounding areas in Mumbai are at the end of their tether. On Wednesday, they demanded answers from Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, even as pockets of fresh fire were noticed by evening.\n\n\u201cWe saw pockets of fire from our balcony at around 5.30 p.m.,\u201d said Deonar resident Priya Fonseca.\n\nAlthough there were conflicting reports on whether the fire had started afresh, residents pointed to the possibility of continuing smouldering activity. \u201cWe did not see any fire, but there is a big cloud of smoke. The whole place is again filled with smoke,\u201d said another Deonar resident Beena Pillai.\n\nResidents of Chembur, Deonar, Govandi and other neighbouring areas staged a protest march on Wednesday. By evening they dashed off an email to Mr. Fadnavis asking for a mechanism to immediately douse the fires and shut the Deonar dumping ground, Ms. Pillai said.\n\nSporting black clothes and surgical masks, residents of different housing societies marched from Chembur\u2019s RK studios to Gandhi Maidan.\n\n\u201cChildren are falling sick, but we don\u2019t know if schools should be shut down. Once upon a time, this area was on the outskirts of Mumbai. Now there are so many colonies. We are taking this up with the CM. Mr. Fadnavis do something,\u201d Megha Bajaj, coordinator of the protest march, told The Hindu .\n\nMeanwhile, there was no improvement in Chembur\u2019s air quality. The air quality index for PM2.5 was 364, just a little above the level on Tuesday and firmly in the \u2018very poor\u2019 category.",
