    "text": "Using nanoparticles of the main ingredient in common antacid tablets can help prevent a cancerous tumour from growing, says a study led by an Indian-origin researcher.\n\nThe scientists used novel methods to create nanoparticles from calcium carbonate that were injected intravenously into a mouse model to treat solid tumours.\n\nThe compound changed the pH (a scale that measures how acidic or basic a substance is) of the tumour environment, from acidic to more alkaline, and kept the cancer from growing.\n\nThis work shows for the first time that it is possible to modulate pH in solid tumours using intentionally designed nanoparticles, the researchers said.\n\nThe results of the research were published online in the journal Nanoscale . \u201cCancer kills because of metastasis,\u201d said Avik Som from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nMetastasis of cancer refers to spread of the disease from one organ to another not directly connected with it.\n\n\u201cThe pH of a tumour has been heavily correlated with metastasis. For a cancer cell to get out of the extracellular matrix, or the cells around it, one of the methods it uses is a decreased pH,\u201d Mr. Som explained.\n\nCommonly, nanoparticles have been made with gold and silver. However, neither is present in the human body, and there are concerns about their accumulating in the body.\n\n\u201cCalcium and carbonate are both found heavily in the body, and they are generally non-toxic,\u201d Mr. Som said. \u201cWhen calcium carbonate dissolves, the carbonate becomes carbon dioxide and is released through the lungs, and calcium is often incorporated into the bones,\u201d Mr. Som explained. \u2014 IANS",
