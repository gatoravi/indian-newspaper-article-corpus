It seems to lead people to think, \u2018Everything else is out of control, so why shouldn\u2019t I be\u2019,\u201d said lead author Lenny Vartanian from the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\nMay apply to men too\n\n\u201cI suspect the same would hold with males,\u201d Mr. Vartanian adds.\n\nFor the study, conducted at the Cornell Food and Brand Lab and published in Environment and Behaviour , 101 women participated with half of them waiting in a cluttered kitchen with scattered piles of papers and dirty dishes, while the other half waited in an organised kitchen.\n\nBoth kitchens had bowls of cookies, crackers, and carrots.\n\nThe latter group later entered the cluttered room feeling in control and ate about 100 fewer calories than those who felt out of control before entering, the study found.\n\n\u2014 IANS\n\nIn a new study, stressed women ate more cookies\n\nin a cluttered catering space",
