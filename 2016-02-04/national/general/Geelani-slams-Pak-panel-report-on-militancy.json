    "text": "A day after a Pakistan parliamentary panel report advocated a crackdown on Kashmiri militancy, separatist Syed Ali Geelani on Wednesday warned Islamabad against withdrawing support to militants operating in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nDescribing the recommendations of the panel \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunjustified, Mr. Geelani said: \u201cThe groups busy in the freedom struggle of Kashmir have nothing to do with the terrorism. They are fighting for the just and genuine demand of Right to Self Determination\u2026\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the panel asked Islamabad \u201cto avoid encouraging the Kashmiri Mujahideen on Pakistan soil and take action against them.\u201d\n\nHitting out at Awais Ahmad Leghari, who headed the panel, 86-year-old Geelani alleged that the report \u201cdepicts an apologetic policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Pakistan will act on these recommendations and take any action against the Kashmiri youth, it will be the follow-up of American policies in Afghanistan. America at first projected the Afghan and Arab youth as Mujahideen and used them against the Soviet Union and when America finished its work, the same Mujahideen were slapped with terrorist labels and dragged to Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib jails,\u201d said Mr. Geelani. He claimed that Kashmiri youth opted for the armed struggle \u201cto fight the rigid and stubborn policy of India.\u201d",
