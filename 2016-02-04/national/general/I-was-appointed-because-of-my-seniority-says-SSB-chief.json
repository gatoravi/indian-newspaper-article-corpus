The SSB is entrusted with guarding the country\u2019s frontiers with Nepal and Bhutan.\n\nMs.Ramasundram, who was the Director of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in her previous posting, is the first woman chief in the six-decade-long combined history of the five paramilitary forces, the CRPF, BSF, CISF, ITBP and the SSB.\n\nShe said that the NCRB might not be considered to be a \u201cprestigious posting\u201d, but she had enjoyed her stint there.\n\nShe said that now women were joining the IPS service in a large numbers and it would be difficult to ignore them for key postings. Speaking about the challenges women officers face, Ms.Ramasundaram recalled an incident when she was posted in Tamil Nadu. She said, \u201cI was already a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) then, but had never served a range (a cluster of several adjoining police districts). I went to my Director General and demanded a field posting. He asked how I would handle my family as it would also mean dislocation. He was being considerate, and I got the posting too, but the question remained - women should not have aspirations.\u201d\n\nShe said combat duties were still considered a tough posting for women.",
