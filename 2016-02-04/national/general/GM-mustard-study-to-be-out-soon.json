    "text": "The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which examines the scientific merits of releasing genetically modified seeds into the environment, will consider making public, immediately, the results of tests and studies so far conducted to test the safety of transgenic (or GM) mustard.\n\nMultiple sources told The Hindu that a decision to commercially release the seed was still some time away. Several members of the GEAC whom The Hindu contacted refused comment saying that they had signed an \u201coath of confidentiality.\u201d\n\nThis comes even as several farmers\u2019 groups and environmental activist organisations have alleged that the GEAC plans to allow GM mustard on farmer fields. \u201cThere is a scientific panel of experts that\u2019s considering this \u2026 there is a lot of data but there are still some outstanding questions. We will take our time on this,\u201d said a top official in the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, requesting anonymity citing the sensitivity of the issue. The GEAC is constituted by the Environment Ministry.\n\nAnother official, who also didn\u2019t want to be identified, said a risk assessment body \u2014 affiliated to the Ministry \u2014 had analysed the results of toxicity studies; the odds of gene flow into the environment, and the results of studies on animals.\n\n\u201cThe data is voluminous and there have been meetings earlier this month discussing this ,\u201d he added.",
