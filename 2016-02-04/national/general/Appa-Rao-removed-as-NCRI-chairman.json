Appa Rao, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hyderabad (UoH) who was forced to go on leave following the row triggered by the suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula, has now lost the position as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the National Commission of Rural Institutes (NCRI), which he has been holding since January 7 this year.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resource Development on Wednesday appointed M. Periasamy, in-charge Vice Chancellor of UoH, to the post with immediate effect. The Ministry\u2019s decision was communicated to UoH\u2019s administrative office by fax. \u201cAs the in-charge CEO and Chancellor of NCRI, I will visit the institute on February 4 to take charge,\u201d Prof. Periasamy confirmed.\n\nProf. Rao was holding additional charge of NCRI even after he went on leave on January 24. As the 15-year-old NCRI has not had a permanent chairman for long, the V-C of UoH is often asked to hold additional charge of the plum post.\n\nAccording to sources, Prof. Appa Rao is not expected to come back to the V-C\u2019s office till the completion of enquiry.",
