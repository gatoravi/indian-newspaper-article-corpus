    "text": "The BJP\u2019s Scheduled Caste Morcha has claimed that the suicide by the University of Hyderabad student Rohith Vemula could have been an act of \u201catonement\u201d after being caught up in Leftist politics.\n\nSpelling out what he thought of the episode, morcha chief Dushyant Gautam told The Hindu that the party\u2019s Dalit front was convincing members of the community that the whole controversy was a \u201cpolitical conspiracy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think atonement and regret about the fact that he was sent by his family to study but got led astray by Left politics was the reason for his unfortunate step,\u201d Mr. Gautam claimed. \u201cHe was under debt. He did not name anyone as the reason for his suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbedkarites and Dalits can never be anti-national. Ambedkar was a great nationalist. Rohith Vemula and his friends openly supported Yakub Memon, who was awarded the death sentence on charges of terror,\u201d Mr. Gautam said.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s line has undergone a subtle shift in the past few days.\n\nTo begin with, the party tried to defend its Union Ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani, who were accused of interfering in the affairs of the university on behalf of a student activist of the ABVP, the party\u2019s student affiliate. The BJP has said that the Ministers\u2019 letters were a routine act of forwarding complaints.\n\nHowever, Scheduled Castes\u2019 Commission Chairman P.L. Punia has said that Rohith was a Dalit as he had been brought up by a Dalit mother. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been told in a centralised manner that this is the party line. But many leaders have said it as it is a fact that the student\u2019s father is an OBC,\u201d a BJP spokesperson said.",
