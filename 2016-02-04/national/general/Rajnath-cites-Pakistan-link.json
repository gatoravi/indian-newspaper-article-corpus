    "text": "Apart from Mr. Rajnath Singh, none of the government\u2019s top leadership that addressed the Counter Terrorism Conference organised by the BJP-affiliated think-tank India Foundation named Pakistan in their speeches on fighting terror.\n\nHowever each of them made pointed references to the scourge of state-sponsored terror, and called for more international solidarity to isolate those states.\n\n\u201cNaming and shaming must be carried out relentlessly in the case of perpetrators, supporters and connivers of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said, as he made a pitch for the ratification of the Indian-sponsored Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations.\n\nFocussing on India\u2019s moves to prevent terror attacks, Mr. Singh called for more coordination among security agencies, and said the government is working on a \u2018National Security Strategy.\u2019 \u201cTerrorism gets compounded when certain states use it as an instrument of their foreign policy. Terrorism is a hydra-headed monster fed by massive supply of funds through different routes. It is a big challenge to cut these supply lines,\u201d he added.\n\nThe statements coming from the government are a break from the past few weeks where very few public statements had been made, and the government had left it to the MEA spokesperson to convey its position.\n\nHowever officials admitted a growing frustration with the pace of Pakistan\u2019s investigations into the Pathankot attack.",
