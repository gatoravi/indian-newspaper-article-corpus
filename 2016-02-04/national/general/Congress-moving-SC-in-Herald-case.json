    "text": "Congress leaders are moving the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the appeals of party president Sonia Gandhi, vice-president Rahul Gandhi and others seeking quashing of summons issued to them by a trial court in The National Herald case.\n\nThe summons was issued on a complaint by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy alleging cheating and breach of trust in the acquisition of the now-defunct National Herald by Young Indian Limited (YIL).\n\nThe Congress leaders own a stake as directors in the YIL, registered as a charitable company.\n\n\u201cYes, the appeal is being filed in the Supreme Court. It is in the process. We have challenged the High Court decision,\u201d senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said on Wednesday.\n\nThe complaint alleged corruption in the assigning of a Rs. 90.25-crore loan owed to the Congress by the Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of The National Herald , to the YIL for Rs. 50 lakh.\n\nThe High Court had in December 2015 said the gravity of the allegations had a \u201cfraudulent flavour\u201d involving a national political party. Therefore, serious imputations smacking of criminality levelled against the petitioners needed to be properly looked into. Justice Sunil Gaur of the High Court made scathing remarks on the \u201cquestionable conduct\u201d in the acquisition of the publication and said criminal proceedings could not be thwarted.",
