    "text": "Three days after some African nationals came under attack in Soledevanahalli following a fatal accident involving a Sudanese national, four persons have been detained on suspicion of molesting and stripping a 24-year-old student from Tanzania that night.\n\nOn Wednesday, a chilling account of the Sunday night incident emerged. In her complaint, the student recalled the ordeal she and three of her friends faced when the locals attacked them.\n\nThe unsuspecting Tanzanian nationals had reached the spot, near Hesaraghatta, almost after half-an- hour of the accident in which a 35-year-old woman was mowed down by the car driven by a Sudanese national.\n\nThe group was chased, assaulted, and the girl\u2019s clothes were torn by the attackers, she said.\n\nA good Samaritan from the area offered her his t-shirt, before the group ran into a BMTC bus, but were cornered by the mob in the bus, she added. Eventually, four locals formed a human chain around the girl and led her to safety. Police have taken up investigations under section 354 against the unknown attackers. The suspects were picked up based on the CCTV footage obtained from in and around the area. Police have subjected the girl to medical examination and recovered the torn clothes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tanzanian Embassy has expressed concern about the attack on its national in Bengaluru.",
