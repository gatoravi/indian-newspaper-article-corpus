The amendment process took a turn towards implementation on Saturday when three main political parties of Nepal promised the United Madhesi Democratic Front (UMDF) a series of amendments.\n\n\u201cThe government of Nepal agreed on two of our demands for the amendment process. But for the main demand of re-drawing of State boundaries, they have asked for three months period. There is no certainty that the Nepal government will stick to the third promise. That is why we are demanding India\u2019s inclusion into the process as a guarantor,\u201d Mr. Mahato said.\n\nState demarcation\n\nSaturday\u2019s understanding reached between the three-party combine and the UMDF pledged to table inclusive and proportional representation of the non-hilly Madhesi population, and constituency delimitation, in the first round of amendments.\n\nHowever soon after the discussions, the UMDF representatives said that they were not satisfied with the position of Nepal government on creation of new State boundaries which they said was necessary to protect Madhesi identity.\n\nNo certainty that Kathmandu will stick to its promise, says Madhesi leader Mahato",
