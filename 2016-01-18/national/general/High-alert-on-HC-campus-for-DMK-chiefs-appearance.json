Karunanidhi is expected to appear before the Principal Sessions Judge on Monday in connection with a criminal defamation case filed against him by the State government.\n\nAs the 91-year-old DMK leader had confirmed in a statement about his appearance at the court around 10 a.m., the security agencies are expecting party cadres to gather in large numbers, and hence the arrangements.\n\nAs the security in Principal Sessions Judge doesn\u2019t come under the purview of theCISF, which is manning only the buildings housing the Madras High Court, the State police have made the arrangements.",
