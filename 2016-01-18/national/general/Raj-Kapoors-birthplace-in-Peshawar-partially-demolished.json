    "text": "The historic home of legendary Bollywood actor-director Raj Kapoor here was partially demolished by its owners for constructing a plaza but timely action by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa authorities saved the building from total destruction.\n\nThe Archives department obtained stay from the local court on Saturday to save the demolition of the historic \u2018Haveli\u2019 situated at Dhaki Munawar Shah of the walled city.\n\nHowever, the new owner by the time had pulled down the first storey of the building for construction of a commercial plaza. The doors and window panes on the second and third floors have also been removed.\n\nThe Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had earlier declared the houses of Peshawar-born Bollywood actors Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar as heritage monuments in order to protect and preserve them.\n\nThe Archives officials said they sought police help to halt the razing of the house. Kapoor\u2019s father Prithviraj Kapoor had constructed the house in 1920, where the Mera Naam Joker star and his siblings were born.\n\nThe Kapoor family later shifted to India after Partition.\n\nDuring the previous Awami National Party government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the house was declared a national heritage but no steps were taken to preserve it. \u2014 PTI",
