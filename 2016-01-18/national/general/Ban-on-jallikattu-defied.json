    "text": "Defying the Supreme Court ban on conducting jallikattu, a bull taming sport, organisers in some interior villages went ahead with the event on Sunday challenging the district administration and police to take action.\n\nIn a few places, instead of the bull taming sport, organisers conducted \u2018eruthattam\u2019 (bull chase).\n\nTension prevailed in Vadavalam village in Pudukottai district as some villagers allegedly pelted the police with stones for preventing them from conducting jallikattu. The villagers allegedly brought bulls to the local temple under the pretext of offering worship but tried to use them to organise jallikattu.\n\nIn Lalgudi in Tiruchi too a few bulls were let loose after being brought to a temple. But locals claimed that these bulls were not tamed and hence the ban on jallikattu was not technically violated. In various villages in Omalur block in Salem district, \u2018eruthattam\u2019 was held.",
