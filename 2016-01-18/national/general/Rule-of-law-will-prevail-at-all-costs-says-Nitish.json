Following the murder of a jeweller on Saturday morning in the State capital, the Opposition parties attacked the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance for its failure to contain the rise in crime.\n\n\u201cOne should not stress on isolated incidents \u2026we\u2019ve taken stern measures to curb organised crimes\u2026there is rule of law and it will be preserved in the State at all costs,\u201d Mr. Kumar told journalists in Patna. \u201cNo laxity on the part of the policemen will be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kumar said he had taken up the Darbhanga incident, in which two engineers were recently killed over extortion demand, \u201cas a challenge.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, a Patna-based jeweller Ravi Kant too was shot dead over extortion demand.\n\nThe gang of extortionists reportedly demanded Rs. 10 lakh and a gold chain from the trader.\n\n\u201cThe fear of the return of jungle raj appears to be true in Bihar. Under the dominance of the numerically-strong RJD, it appears the Nitish government has lost the will to take on the criminals,\u201d State BJP leader Sushil Kumar said.\n\n\u2018One should not stress on isolated incidents \u2026we\u2019ve taken stern measures\u2019",
