Chaturvedi, chief creative of special projects at ZEEL Shailja Kejriwal, South Asian University President Kavita Sharma and South Asian Fraternity secretary-general Satya Pal spoke at a discussion that followed the launch.\n\n\u201cIndia has such strength and power to absorb jolts, and it has been so for centuries. It is wrong to divide India into Hindus and Muslims. There are certain people from both sides who indulge in some kind of wrongdoing but the common notion remains of co-existence,\u201d Mr. Nitesh said. Issues of poverty, gender equity and co-existence were mentioned by Ms. Sharma.\n\nMs. Kejriwal highlighted how the media shaped the perception Indians had of Pakistan for generations.\n\nShe said that through her Zindagi channel, she wanted to \u201cput Pakistan into people\u2019s homes and see if perceptions change if the enemy is in your drawing room 24X7.\u201d She said that when she went to different cities and showed it to people, she received an amazing response.\n\n\u201cOne person even said \u2018they look like us\u2019,\u201d she said amid laughter from the audiences that also had schoolchildren whose paintings were selected from some 300 entries for the calendar, for its fourth edition this year. \u2014 PTI\n\n\u2018Some people indulge in wrongdoing but the common vein is of co-existence\u2019",
