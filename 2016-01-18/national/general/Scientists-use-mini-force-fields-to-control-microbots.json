The team developed a system for controlling the robots with individual magnetic fields from an array of tiny coils.\n\n\u201cThe robots are too small to put batteries on them, so they can\u2019t have onboard power. We use magnetic fields to generate forces on the robots. It\u2019s like using mini force fields,\u201d Mr. Cappelleri said.\n\nThe microbots are magnetic disks that slide across a surface.\n\nWhile the versions studied are around 2 millimetres in diameter \u2014 about twice the size of a pinhead \u2014 researchers aim at creating microbots that are around 250 microns in diameter, or roughly the size of a dust mite.\n\nIn previous systems, the microbots were controlled using fewer coils located around the perimeter of the \u201cworkspace\u201d containing the tiny machines.\n\nHowever, this global field is not fine enough to control individual microrobots independently.\n\n\u201cThe approach we came up with works at the micro-scale, and it will be the first one that can give truly independent motion of multiple microrobots in the same workspace because we are able to produce localised fields as opposed to a global field,\u201d Mr. Cappelleri said.\n\n\u201cWhat we can do now, instead of having these coils all around on the outside, is to print planar coils directly onto the substrate,\u201d he said.\n\nIndependently controlled microbots working in groups might be useful in building micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS, minuscule machines that could have numerous applications from medicine to homeland security.\n\n\u201cWe might use them for cell sorting, cell manipulation, characterisation and so on. You could think about putting the micro-coils on the bottom of a petri dish,\u201d Mr. Cappelleri said.\n\nMicrobots equipped with probe-like \u201cforce sensors\u201d might then be used to detect cancer cells in a biopsy.\n\nUseful in medicine\n\n\u201cCancer cells have different stiffness characteristics than non-cancer cells, and in some of our previous work we put force sensors on the end of these robots to figure out which ones are stiffer than others,\u201d Mr. Cappelleri said.\n\nThe coils were made by printing a copper pattern with the same technology used to manufacture printed circuit boards.\n\nThey can be scaled down from their current size of about 4 millimetres. A new process was needed to create a micro-scale prototype, he said. The study was published in the journal Micromachines . \u2014 PTI",
