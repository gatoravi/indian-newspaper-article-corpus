    "text": "Social activist Anna Hazare is full of praise for his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Arvind Kejriwal, who he said has not taken \u201ca wrong step\u201d after becoming the Delhi Chief Minister.\n\nMr. Hazare said Mr. Kejriwal is a man of \u201cclean character and an idealist\u201d, who changed the \u201ccommon man\u2019s approach\u201d to politics.\n\n\u201cArvind Kejriwal is a man of clean character who is committed to moral values in politics. I have not seen him take a wrong step during the last one year of his tenure as the Chief Minster,\u201d Mr. Hazare said.\n\nHe said Mr. Kejriwal, his comrade-in-arms in the India Against Corruption movement, faces the challenge of taking along good people in politics.\n\n\u201cHe is an idealist. His performance as the Chief Minster so far is a positive achievement. To start a political party was earlier regarded as a privilege of the rich. Arvind has changed the common man\u2019s approach to politics,\u201d Mr. Hazare said.\n\n\u201cHe is honest and transparent. Manish Sisodia (Deputy CM) is also a committed idealist. I want to see politics in the country getting freed from the influence of money power,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nMr. Hazare and Mr. Kejriwal fell out following the latter\u2019s decision to join active politics after floating a political party. However, subsequently, there was a thaw and Mr. Hazare even gave some suggestions to Mr. Kejriwal which the latter included in the Jan Lokpal Bill brought by the Delhi government in December last year.\n\nMr. Hazare also rejected Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s criticism by his detractors that the Delhi Chief Minister had little respect for the Constitution or the law.\n\n\u201cI do not agree that Arvind has no respect for the Constitution or the law of the country. He has come from the movement and asserts his rights. To undertake satyagraha is not anti-constitutional. He has not advocated violence as by naxals to change the system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe odd-even road rationing experiment undertaken by the Kejriwal government also came in for praise by Mr. Hazare. \u2014 PTI",
