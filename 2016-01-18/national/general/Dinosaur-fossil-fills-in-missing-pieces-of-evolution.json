    "text": "The discovery of a 75-million-year-old dinosaur fossil in 2010 from Canada\u2019s Dinosaur Provincial Park has now provided scientists an opportunity to fill in gaps in the evolution of other horned dinosaurs.\n\n\u201cFor the first time ever, we have a complete skeleton of a baby ceratopsid ,\u201d said Professor Philip Currie from the University of Alberta.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only had a few isolated bones before to give us an idea of what these animals should look like as youngsters. All you need is one specimen that ties them all together. Now we have it,\u201d the professor said.\n\nAccording to Prof. Currie, the discovery of juvenile Chasmosaurus allows for the refinement of previous findings.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest benefits is that we can now look at the different body proportions for Chasmosaurus as it grew up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe now have an anchor point with the baby that we can compare with all other specimens of this species, and from that comparison can calculate the dimensions, body weights, and ages for all other ceratopsid species. We can start filling in missing pieces,\u201d the professor added.\n\nThe fossil holds incredible value for paleoecological studies and allows understanding the life history, biomass, population structure, growth rates, variation, and physiology of these animals.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019ve got that basic anatomical information, you\u2019re kind of shooting in the dark with all of these other calculations,\u201d Prof. Currie said.\n\nProf. Currie and his team found that juvenile Chasmosaurus \u2019 skeleton was unexpectedly different in shapes and relative proportions with adult Chasmosaurus .\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt in our minds that a baby would have had a much shorter frill relative to its skull length than an adult. But what we couldn\u2019t see is that it also has a different shape,\u201d the researcher said. \u2014 IANS",
