This is why I wrote the book,\u201d said Barkha Dutt, speaking about This Unquiet Land: Stories from India\u2019s Fault Lines at The Hindu \u2019s Lit for Life festival here on Sunday.\n\nAt an interactive session with dancer Anita Ratnam, Ms. Dutt spoke about urban feminism, while reading out a passage from her book. She also questioned why ambitious women were often judged for their choices.\n\nResponding to a question by Ms. Ratnam on her decision to write about her experience of having faced abuse as a child, Ms. Dutt said while it was a difficult memory to write about, she was sure it was the right thing to do after her urging women to break their silence against violence.\n\nThe session was peppered with anecdotes on her experience covering the Kargil War.",
