    "text": "A day after National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah warmed to the BJP over government formation in Jammu & Kashmir, the party working president Omar Abdullah on Sunday said \u201cthere was no change in the NC stand on coalition with the BJP.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll he has said is that if any proposal comes from the BJP, it will be discussed by the Working Committee of the party for a decision. He hasn\u2019t sought an alliance nor has he promised any support. Only consideration & discussion,\u201d clarified junior Abdullah on Twitter.\n\nMr. Farooq Abdullah, while speaking to the media in Jammu on Saturday, had said: \u201cIf such a proposal [from the BJP] comes, then the NC will call a meeting. If such a situation arises, NC can think it over. We have not closed the doors on the BJP.\u201d\n\nHis remarks have come at a time when the NC is building its political capital in the State over the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alliance with the BJP.\n\nBesides senior leaders, a team of dedicated online NC leaders have , for the past nine months, taken to the social networking sites to attack the PDP for providing a rare chance to the BJP to rule the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority State.\n\nTo douse the political storm whipped up by Mr. Farooq Abdullah, the NC also issued a formal statement on Facebook: \u201cThe Working Committee in its recent meeting in Srinagar had endorsed the decision taken by the NC a year ago to stay away from the BJP. We expect no change in that decision.\u201d\n\nIt said the PDP was an ally of the BJP and the NC was not obliged \u201cto rescue either the PDP or the BJP\u201d from the stalemate in their alliance.",
