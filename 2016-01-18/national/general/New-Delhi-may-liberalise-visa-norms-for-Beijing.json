However, China is yet to respond to India\u2019s demand to offer a similar arrangement for its citizens.\n\nDespite opposition from the intelligence agencies against extending e-visa facility for the Chinese, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his maiden visit to the country in May 2015, had announced it.\n\n\u201cChina has assured that they were working on a mechanism that would ease visa restrictions for Indians. This would include time-bound replies to the applicants,\u201d said the official.\n\nIndia is actively considering lifting strict conditions when granting conference and research visas for the Chinese and the time limit for these visits would also be increased, said the official.\n\nChina is among the top five nations which have expressed interest in doing business in India.\n\nAccording to Ministry of Home Affairs data, eight Chinese companies were given the green signal to start business operations in India under the Make in India policy.",
