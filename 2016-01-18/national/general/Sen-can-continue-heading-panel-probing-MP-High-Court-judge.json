    "text": "RS Secretariat had asked the Law Ministry whether Justice Sen can continue to head panel despite his retirement on December 31, 2015.\n\nJustice Vikramjit Sen can continue to head a panel, appointed by Vice- President Hamid Ansari to probe sexual harassment charges against Madhya Pradesh High Court judge Justice S.K. Gangele, even after retirement, unless Mr. Ansari chooses to replace him.\n\nAn opinion stating this was tendered to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi. The RS Secretariat had asked the Law Ministry whether Justice Sen, a sitting Supreme Court judge when he was appointed the chief of the panel in April last year, can continue to head it despite his retirement on December 31, 2015.\n\nThe Ministry was also asked whether, if another sitting SC judge is appointed in place of Justice Sen, would the panel then start its investigation afresh or continue from where the Sen panel had left.\n\nReferring to views in some quarters of the Law Ministry that a new presiding officer be appointed following retirement of Justice Sen, the AG said the Rajya Sabha Chairman can also nominate another sitting judge of the Supreme Court in his place.\n\nHe said the probe by the committee could recommence from the stage it was on December 31 when Justice Sen retired. The top law officer has opined both the options would be valid. Mr. Rohatgi said the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968 is silent on whether a judge can continue on an investigation panel after his or her retirement. In April last year, Mr. Ansari appointed the three-member panel to investigate sexual harassment charges against Justice Gangele.",
