Even former Chief Minister of the State and veteran Communist leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had called upon the Congress and the Left Front to join hands.\n\nHowever, the issue of an alliance with the Congress brought into the open strong differences among the Left parties, including the Left Front\u2019s traditional constituents.\n\nWhile the All India Forward Bloc and the Communist Party of India are against any alliance with the Congress, the Revolutionary Socialist Party has expressed support for it. AIFB general secretary Debabrata Biswas criticised the CPI(M) leadership for making \u201csuch open offers to the Congress\u201d.\n\nLeft Front partners in West Bengal are divided over an alliance with the Congress",
