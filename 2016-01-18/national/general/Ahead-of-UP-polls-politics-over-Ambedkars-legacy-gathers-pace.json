Appropriating the legacy of Babasaheb is considered a key thread of the political strategy applied by parties to secure Dalit support.\n\nThe social group together forms a major chunk \u2014 almost 22 per cent \u2014 of the State\u2019s electorate. There are 66 Dalit sub-castes in the State.\n\nTaking steps to honour the architect of the Indian Constitution, the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government has promised to provide land for the construction of a \u201cgrand memorial\u201d dedicated to him.\n\nOn January 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the State capital and attend functions bearing the name of Babasaheb.\n\nFor the memorial, Mr. Yadav said he would allot land in the C.G (Chak Ganjaria) City project, an ambitious premium township on the outskirts of Lucknow.\n\nHe took the decision after a meeting with Lalji Prasad Nirmal, the president of the Baba Saheb Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Mahasabha, an organisation that claims to propagate the vision and ideals of Babasaheb.\n\nIn what will be his first visit to the State capital after assuming the top post, Mr. Modi is scheduled to attend the convocation of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University. He will also visit the premises of the Ambedkar Mahasabha, where the ashes of Dr. Ambedkar are kept, and pay homage.\n\nThe posturing of the BJP and the SP has not gone down well with the Bahujan Samaj Party, which currently commands the largest chunk of Dalit votes in the State.\n\nOn her 60th birthday on Friday, BSP chief Mayawati attacked both the parties for \u201cworking against the interests of Dalits.\u201d\n\nShe accused the Modi government of engaging in \u201ccosmetic work\u201d regarding Dalits merely to appropriate the legacy of Babasaheb ahead of the elections, even as the party plotted to wipe out reservation and other constitutional rights enjoyed by the oppressed communities.\n\nLaunching a direct attack at the Akhilesh Yadav government, Ms. Mayawati said the SP\u2019s mindset towards Dalits was of \u201ccasteist and political hatred.\u201d",
