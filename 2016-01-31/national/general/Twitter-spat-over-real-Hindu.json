    "text": "Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and Bollywood actor Anupam Kher, at the centre of a debate on tolerance in India, got into a Twitter spat over whether or not Hindus in India should be circumspect in proclaiming themselves as such and the categorisation of them in ideological terms.\n\nThe spat was sparked off when the actor, in a television interview, said that the situation in the country was such that he was \u201cscared to say openly that I am a Hindu.\u201d\n\nMr.Tharoor took up the gauntlet, chiding Mr.Kher, \u201cCome on Anupam, I say it all the time, I\u2019m a proud Hindu. Just not the Sangh\u2019s kind of Hindu.\u201d He was referring to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and its espousal of Hindutva, differentiating it from Hinduism.\n\nThe matter didn\u2019t end there, with Mr.Kher responding to Mr.Tharoor, accusing him of misinterpreting his statement, and also calling him a \u201cCongi c hamcha \u201d or sycophant of the Congress.\n\nMr.Tharoor the accused Mr.Kher of using abusive words when he \u201cruns out of arguments\u201d and stated that he (Tharoor) was proud of his Congress credentials.\n\nMr.Kher then castigated Mr.Tharoor for differentiating between different kinds of Hindus. \u201cSadly, you forgot that you brought in your kind of Hindu and Sanghi Hindu first. You want to categorize that also?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr.Kher had marched in protest against fellow actor Aamir Khan\u2019s remarks on what the latter perceived as diminishing religious tolerance in India after the deaths of writer M.M. Kalburgi and the Dadri lynching episode last year, putting himself firmly on the side of the BJP, which had protested against Mr.Khan\u2019s remarks as being politically motivated. Mr.Kher\u2019s wife, Kirron Kher, is the BJP MP from Chandigarh.",
