Air India has denied the allegation, saying the wheelchair was provided at the doorstep of the aircraft.\n\nAnita Ghai, Associate Professor, Delhi University, took the Alliance Air (Air India\u2019s regional arm) flight from Dehradun on Friday, with four of her colleagues. \u201cDespite my repeated requests, the [air] hostess did not recognise my requirement for a wheelchair after reaching. The flight reached at 7.30 p.m. I waited patiently with one of my friends,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt 8:15 p.m., we realised that there was no chance of [getting] a wheelchair. The [passenger] coach came at 8.30 p.m. after repeated requests from the flight commander. Since security reasons are critical, they made me crawl to go to the coach,\u201d she alleged.\n\n\u201cWe strongly deny the statement. We at Air India give utmost importance to passenger\u2019s safety and comfort,\u201d an Air India statement said. Since the ATR aircraft was parked at a distant bay, it took some time to bring the wheelchair, the airline said. \u201cSince passengers were getting down from the aircraft, our support staff actively helped the passenger to come out of the plane and the wheelchair was provided at the doorstep,\u201d Air India said. \u2014 PTI",
