    "text": "The Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), a rightwing Hindu outfit on Saturday said that opposition to the release of a book, Nathuram Godse\u2014 The Story of an Assassin , is an attack on freedom of expression.\n\nResponding to the decision of the State-owned Ravindra Bhavan in Margao in south Goa to cancel permission earlier granted for a programme of release of the book on Saturday, spokesperson of HJS Manoj Salunke lamented that the BJP government succumbed to pressure of protestors and cancelled the permission to release the book written by Anup Ashok Sardesai, a local writer.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on the Constitutional right of freedom of expression of an individual. This also is suppression of a Hindu writer. The HJS condemns this opposition to release of the book,\u201d said Mr. Salunke.\n\nWhile the book was released at another venue on Saturday in Margao in the presence of Satyaki Savarkar, grand-nephew of Veer Savarkar and Mr. Sanjay Vaishampayan, former chief of Hindu Mahasabha, Pune, smoothly, the issue raised much debate for previous few days across the State.",
