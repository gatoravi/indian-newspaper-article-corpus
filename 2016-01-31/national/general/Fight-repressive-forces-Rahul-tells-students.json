    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who visited the University of Hyderabad and backed the demands of the protesting students, drew a parallel between the death of research scholar Rohith Vemula and Mahatma Gandhi, whose death anniversary fell on Saturday.\n\n\u201cGandhiji lived and understood truth and he was killed by the same forces which did not want him to say the truth. Rohith was a young man, who was looking to understand where he fits in this universe and he was looking to understand his world. Nobody can take away the search for freedom or truth. Some forces did not want him to express what he saw and they put so much pressure that he killed himself. There are Rohiths in every institution in this country,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said.\n\nObjecting to some students of the university being called anti-national, Mr.Gandhi urged the students to fight forces that curtailed freedom.\n\nSoon after he ended his speech around 5.45 p.m., Mr. Gandhi who was offered lime juice to break his day-long fast by activist Kancha Ilaiah, chose to give it to Rohith\u2019s mother Radhika before ending his fast and leaving the premises.\n\nMr. Gandhi sat alongside three students who are on a hunger strike since Friday midnight. Mr. Gandhi reached the venue Friday midnight to participate in the candlelight vigil and hunger strike organised on the 27th birthday of Rohith.\n\nA political tool: BJP\n\nThe BJP accused the Congress and Mr. Gandhi of using the death of Rohith as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d. Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said nine Dalit students had committed suicide on the campus during the UPA rule, but Mr. Gandhi had not gone there, instead asked the Opposition to wait for the probe report ordered by the Centre.",
