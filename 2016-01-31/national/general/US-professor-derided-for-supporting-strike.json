    "text": "A New York-based professor, who recently came to the University of Hyderabad (UoH) to deliver lectures, is learnt to have faced the ire of the varsity authorities for participating and speaking in the meeting organised by the striking student protesters.\n\nImmanuel Ness, Professor at University of New York (Brooklyn College), was said to have been reprimanded by a senior faculty member of the UoH\u2019s Department of Political Science. \u201cFor pledging solidarity to protesting students, I was called a Stalinist,\u201d Prof.Ness, who is currently in New York, told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cI was not informed of the protests on UoH campus. And once I reached UoH, I only wanted to address the protesters as I was in support of their political movement. But those who invited me were not very pleased with the idea and they turned hostile,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile he was not reimbursed the travel expenses, what appalled Prof. Ness was the complaint against him for speaking in favour of student outfits on campus.\n\n\u201cSome inflammatory and derogatory comments were made against the protesting student outfits. I was taken aback by the texts and e-mails which were sent to me after I participated in the protest,\u201d Prof.Ness said. Asked for a comment about the Political Science Department\u2019s stand on the matter, Arun Patnaik, a senior professor of the department, said there was no collective stand. \u201cI was one among the people who were trying to open a dialogue between the two warring groups of students before Rohith Vemula\u2019s death,\u201d he said.",
