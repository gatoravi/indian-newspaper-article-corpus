However he cautioned that it had to be \u201cunleashed\u201d carefully.\n\n\u201cThe defence sector is like a Doberman, when you unleash it, you have to be careful that it does not bite anyone. In defence exports, we have almost removed all restrictions and in 2016 there will be even easier ways of exporting even higher level material,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said addressing a Business Summit.\n\nTo promote greater investment by foreign companies in the sector and bring in technologies, the government had raised the FDI in manufacturing to 49 per cent.\n\nMr. Parrikar said that it was \u201cessential\u201d and it could be higher on a \u201ccase to case basis.\u201d \u201cThe process for that has been reduced to the ministerial level instead of the cabinet level which was much more difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Parrikar had been pushing for changes in blacklisting procedures in case of wrong doing which has been adversely hurting the preparedness of the services. Instead the Ministry is contemplating heavy fines on those responsible. \u201cI believe that the less the government is in any manufacturing sector, the faster it will progress,\u201d he said.",
