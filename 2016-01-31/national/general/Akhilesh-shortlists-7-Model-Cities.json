    "text": "The omission of Uttar Pradesh from the smart cities list released by the Centre may have had the ruling Samajwadi Party complaining but it also gives Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav an opportunity to showcase his own pet project of developing cities.\n\nThe SP government has formalised its own version of the Smart Cities concept named the \u201cModel Cities\u201d development project. Under this, the State will develop towns with historical, socio-cultural and tourism heritage significance.\n\nMr. Yadav has shortlisted seven cities \u2014Vrindavan, Mahoba, Ayodhya-Faizabad, Varanasi, Sitapur, Chitrakoot and Charkari.\n\nReligious importance\n\nThe selection of these cities, of religious importance to Hindus and key centres of pilgrimage, would also provide fillip to the party\u2019s efforts to correct its image among the majority community ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections.\n\nOften accused of \u201cMuslim appeasement\u201d by the BJP, the SP wants to shed the image, which it believes cost it dearly in 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nBased on the paradigm of swach (clean), surakshit (safe) and sustainable, the project would deal with the growing challenges of urbanisation, in particular, the housing problem for the urban poor, checking encroachments and illegal colonies, expansion of slums, environmental and hygiene parameters.",
