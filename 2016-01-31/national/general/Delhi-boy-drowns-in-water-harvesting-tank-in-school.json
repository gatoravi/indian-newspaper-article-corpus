While his father is a radiographer, his mother is a member of the hospital\u2019s nursing staff.\n\nFollowing the incident, Divyansh\u2019s parents have accused the school authorities of negligence and concealing the boy\u2019s death from them for too long. However, the school authorities have dismissed the allegations, claiming that the boy was suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, causing him to walk in and out of class on his own.\n\n\u201cThe boy\u2019s parents and teachers knew of his medical condition. We were paying special attention to him,\u201d said Sandhya Sabu, principal of the school, while speaking to a news channel. However, Divyansh\u2019s parents have claimed that their son suffered no such medical condition. The death was discovered around 12 noon.\n\n\u201cMy son had been a student at the school for the last three years. He attended the school despite the holiday on Saturday because of a poetry competition organised by the school,\u201d said Divyansh\u2019s father Ramhet Meena.\n\nPolice said the incident took place sometime during the seventh period that concludes at 12. Finding the boy missing, the school authorities launched a search in the premises. Later, a school staff found the body floating in a water storage tank under the school\u2019s amphitheatre. How and why the boy reached the obscure spot is under investigation, the police said.\n\nThe principal claimed the boy was pulled out, administered first aid and rushed to the nearby Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, where he was declared brought dead.",
