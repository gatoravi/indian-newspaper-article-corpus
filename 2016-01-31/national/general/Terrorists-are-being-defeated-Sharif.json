We will do this and the ongoing investigations will soon be completed.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharif had formed a six-member committee, headed by Additional Inspector General of Punjab\u2019s Counter Terrorism Department, to investigate the attack in which seven security personnel were killed.\n\nSix terrorists, allegedly from the now-outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammad group, stormed the Indian Air Force base in Punjab\u2019s Pathankot town and killed seven security personnel. They, too, were killed by the Indian security forces.\n\nPunjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said none of the \u2018suspects\u2019 arrested in connection with the attack had been charged. \u201cThe investigation team is probing the matter and its findings will be made public,\u201d he told reporters. \u2014 PTI",
