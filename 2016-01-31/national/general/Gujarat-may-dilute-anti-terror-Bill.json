    "text": "The Gujarat government is likely to water down \u201ccontentious provisions\u201d in the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Bill which has been returned by the President for clarifications on certain provisions deemed to be draconian and ripe for misuse by the police.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to receive the communication from the Union Home Ministry regarding the clarifications sought. But we will water down some provisions to make it tenable,\u201d a top official told The Hindu .\n\nOne main issue is custody of 180 days without framing charges, prone to be misused by the police, he said.\n\nThe Bill allows confessions before police officers to be admissible in court as evidence against the accused.\n\nIn the past, such provisions were apparently misused in TADA and POTA, both repealed now. It also provides powers to the police for attachment and forfeiture of property of a member of an organised crime syndicate. \u201cThe word \u2018terrorism\u2019 is likely to be done away with in the Bill because terrorism is a Central subject and a State cannot pass a law on it,\u201d the official said. The State Home Department is likely to review provisions related to interception.",
