    "text": "The move has upset regional balance, claims Chief Minister\n\nBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday slammed the Centre for not including any city from the State in the list of Smart Cities, saying it had \u201cignored\u201d Bihar and upset the regional balance. His deputy in the Cabinet, Tejaswi Yadav, too said the Centre\u2019s omission amounted to \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against Bihar.\n\n\u201cThe Bihar government had sent them (the Centre) a proposal as per the required format. Earlier, the Centre had some cities in Bihar for the Smart City list but now they have ignored Bihar,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.\n\nAddressing journalists here, the Chief Minister said though it was the Centre\u2019s decision to develop Smart Cities and it had prepared the criteria to select cities from different States, it had done a U-turn on the project.",
