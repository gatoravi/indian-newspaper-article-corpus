Civic authorities suspect that some mischief mongers had intentionally fuelled the fire, and an FIR was lodged against an unknown person at Shivaji Nagar police station.\n\nState Health Minister Deepak Sawant said, \u201cThere is a possibility of poisonous elements in the smoke harming people. The government has taken this very seriously, and held discussions with the civic and health officials who will take precautions.\u201d\n\nThe civic body also issued an advisory to the residents in north eastern suburbs such as Chembur, Deonar and Ghatkopar to cover their nose and mouths with wet handkerchief and suggested use of black goggles to protect eyes as from the smoke. Due to the thick smog, over 74 municipal schools run in Ghatkopar, Chembur, Mankhurd, Govandi and nearby areas remained closed for the second day on Saturday.\n\n\u201cFirst solve the dumping ground issue and then only then think of \u2018Make in India\u2019 in Mumbai. First \u2018Make Mumbai\u2019, then \u2018Make In India\u2019. We will protest at Bandra Kurla Complex grounds and show all foreign investors the fumes and smoke of dumping ground. Let the whole world also see what Shiv Sena-BJP has done at the BMC for many years,\u201d NCP leader Sachin Ahir told reporters.\n\nMinutes later, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted, \u201cSpoke to Mumbai Municipal Commissioner. He assured that no stone will be left unturned to control the smoke at Deonar.\u201d\n\nMumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar, and BJP\u2019s group leader in the BMC, Manoj Kotak, visited the dumping ground at 5.30 pm and urged the Chief Minister to order a probe the reason behind the fire, and why could it not be doused for three days, as well as the impact on the pollution on Mumbai residents.",
