This report is just one sided; the Centre has not consulted the State government nor the district administration. This is a report which has been made by one person. There has been no such situation in the State and [it] won\u2019t ever take place,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Mr. Sinha took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cgreat advisers\u201d wondering what answers they would have if the Supreme Court ruled against it. \u201cI have tremendous faith in our dashing, dynamic action hero PM. But wonder who the \u2018great\u2019 advisors are who advised President\u2019s Rule in Arunachal Pradesh. That too when the matter is sub judice, in the Supreme Court, under a 5 judge constitutional bench. Wonder what was the hurry and worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod forbid, if the decision does not go in our favour, wonder what explanation and answer we will have for our respected PM,\u201d he said.",
