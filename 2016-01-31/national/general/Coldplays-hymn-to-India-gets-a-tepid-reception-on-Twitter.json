The video has Beyonce playing an Indian film star with the poster of her latest (fictional) film Rani on the billboards. Beyonce has henna on her hands and sports an ethnic outfit and jewellery.\n\nDirected by Ben Mor, the video also features a cameo by Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor.\n\n\u201cA story to tell my grandkids! I was in a @Coldplay video! Woo hoo! #biggestfan,\u201d an excited Sonam tweeted.\n\nThe video was shot in the streets of Mumbai and other parts of India with its theme anchored on the festival of Holi.\n\nWhile a lot of fans have applauded the band for showcasing the myriads colours of India in a beautiful way there are some who have slammed the video for cultural appropriation.\n\n\u201cNo thanks for the bundle of stereotypes @coldplay. No wonder then that India will be known as the country of snake charmers & sadhus,\u201d a Twitter user posted.\n\nAnother tweet said: \u201cColdplay\u2019s new video \u2018Hymn For The Weekend\u2019 looks like \u2018Slumdog Millionaire\u2019 had a holi sequence.\u201d\n\n\u201c@coldplay don\u2019t exoticize us. You\u2019ve been to the clubs and everything. Why do you want to make it seem like all we do is dance in the streets,\u201d another user wrote.\n\nThe four minute and 20 second video includes a ride in the famous black-and-yellow taxis of Mumbai to temple scenes.\n\nSome people showed support for the song. \u201cAll this \u2018cultural appropriation\u2019 talk. If anything, the video showcases the beauty of India. No need for all the drama,\u201d one user tweeted. \u2014 PTI",
