But the little boy said he idolised Messi.\n\n\u201cI love Messi, he plays well, the shirt was made by my brother and I liked it very much,\u201d Murtaza said. \u201cWe do not have a football playground near our house, and the only ball I have is punctured.\u201d But he added: \u201cI want to be like Messi, when I grow up.\u201d\n\nInternet users had quickly tried to identify the boy shown in the pictures and it was initially claimed he was an Iraqi Kurd before Murtaza\u2019s uncle Azim Ahamdi, who lives in Australia, posted pictures of his nephew and said he was the unwitting star of the story.\n\nThe family, who live in a remote rural area, only learned about Murtaza\u2019s newfound fame from relatives when Murtaza\u2019s father\u2019s visited the Afghan capital Kabul. \u201cHe (Murtaza) asked me to buy him a Messi jersey but I am a farmer and could not afford it,\u201d Mohammad Arif Ahamdi, a father of six, said.\n\n\u201cMurtaza wants to meet Lionel Messi in person one day,\u201d he added. \u201cI want my son to become a good football player in the future and become the Messi of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nSport was rarely played under Taliban rule, and the football stadium in Kabul was a notorious venue for executions, stonings and mutilations.\n\nFootball and cricket are the two most popular sports in war-torn Afghanistan. \u2014 AFP\n\nI love Messi, he plays well, the shirt was made by my brother and I liked it very much",
