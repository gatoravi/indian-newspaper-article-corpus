Three other convicts were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe verdict comes more than two-and-a-half years after the incident, which sent shock waves across the State.\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge Sanchita Sarkar said the case fell within the category of the rarest of rare cases and awarded the capital punishment to Saiful Ali, Ansar Ali and Amin Ali. Sheikh Emanul Islam, Aminur Islam and Bhola Naskar, who have been convicted of the charges of gang rape, criminal conspiracy and causing disappearance of evidence, were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe conviction was announced on Thursday.\n\nThe West Bengal Police arrested nine persons for the crime.\n\nWhile Gopal Naskar died in police custody during the trial, Rafiqul Islam and Nur Ali were acquitted for want of evidence. The villagers and the family members hailed the verdict. But the brother of the deceased girl was upset at the acquittal of the two accused. \u201cWe are very happy with the verdict, but the happiness would have been greater had all the convicts been awarded the death penalty. We will meet the Chief Minster over the acquittal of the two accused,\u201d he said.",
