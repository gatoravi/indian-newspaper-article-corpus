    "text": "In what could turn out to be a politically tricky situation ahead of the zilla panchayat polls in Karnataka, the Union Water Resources Ministry has turned down the request of the State seeking an out-of-the-tribunal settlement for the inter-State row over sharing of Mahadayi water. Farmers have been up in arms in north Karnataka demanding a settlement to the issue, so that canal work can be undertaken.\n\nGoa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar too, has turned down Karnataka\u2019s request for holding negotiations, and preferred to go with the tribunal proceedings.\n\nIn a letter dated December 23, addressed to Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti maintained that any intervention by her Ministry at this juncture when the matter is pending before the Tribunal will be \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nResponding to a request made by Karnataka seeking her intervention, Ms. Bharti has pointed out that the Centre had constituted Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal on November 16, 2010, for adjudicating the dispute between Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka.\n\nDuring pendency of the issue before the tribunal, the process of negotiation can be initiated only if all the parties concerned show willingness for negotiation, she said. At present, there is no such proposal from Maharashtra and Goa.\n\nThis could prove tricky for both Cong and BJP ahead of ZP polls",
