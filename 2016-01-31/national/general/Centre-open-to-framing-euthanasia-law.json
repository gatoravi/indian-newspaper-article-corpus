    "text": "The committee, however, rejected legalising \u201cactive euthanasia\u201d \u2014 an intentional act of putting to death a terminally ill patient \u2014 on the ground that this would lead to potential misuse and was practised in \u201cvery few countries worldwide\u201d.\n\nThe Health Ministry said it had then consulted the Ministry of Law and Justice on the appropriateness of framing the euthanasia law, an issue which has been under the consideration of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court since February 2014. At this point, the Health Ministry said it was \u201cprudent to stay its hands\u201d. The affidavit traces back how the debate on legalising and regulating euthanasia began with a private member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha \u2014 the Euthanasia (Regulation) Bill, 2002 \u2014 which was examined by the Health Ministry.\n\nThe debate started again four years later, following the Law Commission Report on euthanasia and the drafting of the Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill, 2006.\n\nBut the Ministry\u2019s experts under the Director-General of Health Services took a stand against euthanasia, arguing that it amounted to \u201cintentional killing\u201d and was against the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nThe affidavit stated how the government viewed euthanasia as an act against progressive medical science\u2019s objective to rehabilitate and treat patients.\n\nThe government\u2019s perceptions about euthanasia changed in 2011 when the Supreme Court issued comprehensive guidelines allowing passive euthanasia in the tragic case of the bed-ridden former Mumbai nurse Aruna Shanbaug, the affidavit said.",
