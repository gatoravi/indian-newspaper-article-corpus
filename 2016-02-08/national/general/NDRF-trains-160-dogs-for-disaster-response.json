This is the first time that dogs for disaster response are being trained on such a large scale indigenously. These canines are different from the regular police and tracker dogs and have immense capabilities in sniffing life from under the debris,\u201d NDRF Director General O.P. Singh told PTI.\n\nAs the requirements of the NDRF in this domain are large, the DG said, the force had taken upon itself to train this special class of dogs, a task being done in India for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances in the past when dogs proved that they are multiple times better than human rescuers due to their inherent special skills,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI",
