    "text": "Recalling that the rise of Hitler in Germany and imposition of the Emergency in India came through normal democratic processes, actor Kamal Haasan has said that a \u201cconstant vigil\u201d is required to safeguard the freedom of speech in a democracy.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is often touted as the only bastion of freedom of speech. It is a work in progress. Constant vigil is necessary to safeguard it,\u201d Mr. Haasan said at the annual India Conference at Harvard University on Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cIt is only through the offices of democracy that Adolf Hitler rose to power. In the Indian political history, the Emergency was promulgated and voices were silenced,\u201d he said. In his keynote address, the Vishwaroopam star, who is part of the reform committee that will recommend changes in the functioning of the Central Board of Film Certification in India, said the freedom of speech should not be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cI have taken the opportunity to put on record here and in India that we can\u2019t take freedom of speech for granted and complacently think that democracy automatically means freedom of speech,\u201d Mr. Haasan said.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that he was not criticising the democracy of India and, in fact, was proud of it.\n\n\u201cNot only India, but the world is in transition. The world is going to face new challenges, find new opportunities. We want India not to be complacent, but set world standards,\u201d he said. \u201cI, as an artist, believe that freedom of speech is separate from the ruling political state,\u201d he added. \u2014 PTI",
