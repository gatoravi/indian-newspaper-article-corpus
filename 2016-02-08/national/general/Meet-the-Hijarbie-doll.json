Pearl brooch And a dazzling smile ?? #hijarbiestyle,\u201d reads one such Instagram post that shows one complete look of Hijarbie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have loved to dress up a black doll myself too. I\u2019ve ordered for some internationally and they\u2019ll soon be here. I basically started with what I had.\n\n\u201cWhen will purchase be possible: As soon as possible, we are in the process of building a website and working towards production and making hijarbie available for purchase soon,\u201d Adam said in an Instagram post along with a photograph of herself that shows her wearing a \u2018hijab\u2019.\n\nComplete with a tiny hijab on her plastic head, the miniature fashionista could not be further away from the blonde doll that has brandished the bedrooms of millions of youngsters for almost 60 years, Sunday Express reported.\n\nAdam\u2019s creation comes just days after toy maker Mattel introduced a more realistic range of Barbie dolls in the biggest shake-up in the 57 year history of the model.\n\nBesides including four body types \u2014 the original rail\u2014 thin Barbie, a taller Barbie, one with more curves and a petite version, the new line has seven skin tones, 22 eye colours and a number of hair styles. Some of the models are black, though there have been black Barbies since 1980. \u2014 PTI",
