    "text": "The Vellore police have requested scientists at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru to analyse the stone-like object, which was recovered from Bharathidasan Engineering College, Natrampalli, to ascertain if it was a meteorite.\n\n\u201cA small stone weighing about 10 grams was recovered from the spot. We had sent a requisition to IIA scientists asking them to come and examine the object. A team from IIA will be visiting the district on Monday to analyse it,\u201d said P.K. Senthilkumari, Superintendent of Police, Vellore.\n\nShe said as there were doubts whether the stone was a meteorite, an analysis would establish the nature of the object.\n\nOn Saturday, one person was killed, and four others injured when the object reportedly fell on the college campus on the National Highway 48 at about 12.30 p.m. There was an explosion-like impact that left a three-four-foot deep crater on the campus.\n\nPolice personnel who recovered the stone said it was black in colour, irregular in shape and looked like \u201ceeyam\u201d.\n\nThe team recovered the stone at about 4 p.m. from the rear side of the college canteen. Soil samples have also been lifted for testing.\n\nCollege principal G. Baskar said they heard a loud sound.\n\nTeam expected today, ISRO scientists visit the site",
