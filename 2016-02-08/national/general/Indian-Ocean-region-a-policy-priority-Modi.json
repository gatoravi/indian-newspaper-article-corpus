Deepak\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday invited international companies to make in India and make for India under a drive launched by his government. He wanted the youth of the coastal areas to join the endeavour to make India a Blue Economy. Speaking at the International Fleet Review 2016 here in the evening, he talked about reigniting the manufacturing sector with the \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign. Defence and shipbuilding were its focus areas.\n\nPointing out that India is a maritime nation, Mr. Modi underscored the importance of the Indian Ocean region to the country.\n\n\u201cThe Indian Ocean region is one of my foremost policy priorities. Our approach is evident in our vision of \u2018Sagar,\u2019 which means \u201cOcean\u201d and which stands for Security and Growth for All in the Region. We would continue to pursue and promote our geo-political, strategic and economic interests in the seas, especially the Indian Ocean,\u201d he said.\n\nCongress hits back\n\nTaking a dig at Mr. Modi\u2019s remarks against the Congress in Paradip, the Odisha PCC blamed the erstwhile NDA government for non-completion of IOC\u2019s Paradip refinery.\n\nMocking at the Prime Minister\u2019s statement that he would have been happy had the project been completed 15 years ago, PCC president Prasad Harichandan said Mr. Modi was \u201ceither misinformed or not informed\u201d as 15 years ago the NDA was in power at the Centre.",
