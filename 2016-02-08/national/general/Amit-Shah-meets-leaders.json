The Assembly polls early next year is believed to have been discussed at the meeting. Mr. Shah told party leaders to take the schemes of the Narendra Modi government to the people in the villages.\n\nSources said the message was to inform the people of the farm crop insurance and the Mudra Bank schemes for small entrepreneurs. The party is planning a large farmers\u2019 rally at Bareilly on February 28, in a bid to reach out to them in this largely agrarian State.",
