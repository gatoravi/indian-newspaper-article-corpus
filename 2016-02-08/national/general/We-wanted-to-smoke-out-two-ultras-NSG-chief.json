Tayal, has said that two terrorists who were hiding in the airmen\u2019s billet in the Pathankot airbase could most probably be \u201cloaders\u201d who had accompanied the four terrorists killed earlier in the operation.\n\nAsked how \u201cloaders\u201d could recognise NSG commandos, Mr. Tayal said: \u201cThese men are given some basic training about the counter-terrorism forces and our black dungaree uniform is unique\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as we placed the sensor [on one of the walls on the ground floor of the billet], a grenade was lobbed from inside. We presumed that one of the two terrorists was injured during the first few minutes as firing came from only one kind of weapon, which was a pistol. They did not use any other weapon like AK-47, but lobbed a lot of grenades. The man firing at us moved from one corner to another,\u201d Mr. Tayal said.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu earlier, the presence of two terrorists in the billet was noticed on the third day of the operation as the door of the airmen\u2019s billet was bolted from inside, and nobody answered it when the buildings were being sanitised. \u201cWe did not want to blow up the building; we wanted to catch them alive. They had been cornered in a room and we were all set to make room-intervention. But the news of [the death] Lt. Col. Niranjan arrived, and we decided to blow up the building, we did not want more casualties,\u201d he said.",
