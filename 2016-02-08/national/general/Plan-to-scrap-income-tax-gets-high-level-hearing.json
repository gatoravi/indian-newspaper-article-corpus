    "text": "A presentation made last week for a sub-group of Secretaries set up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to abolish income tax and over 30 local, State and Central taxes. The proposal from a Pune-based tax research outfit, Arthakranti, advocates replacing the present tax system with a single 2 per cent levy per receipt in bank accounts and recommends that just import duties be retained from the present system.\n\nWhile the government is pitching for quick passage of the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill for the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax, Arthakranti\u2019s proposal envisages a system that does not tax consumption or income, as is the case now, but the \u201cvelocity of money\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was clarified by the official who made the presentation that the \u2018ground-breaking\u2019 tax reform proposal is not for the consideration of the upcoming budget,\u201d an official source, who attended the meeting, told The Hindu . The \u201cinnovative\u201d proposal was aimed at reducing corruption and eliminating the cost of compliance for taxpayers, the source said.\n\nEarlier when yoga guru Ramdev had called for the abolition of income tax, Arthakranti submitted this proposal in the run-up to the 2014 general election to the Highways Minister and former BJP president, Nitin Gadkari. Then, he was heading a BJP committee responsible for preparing its vision document on reforms in police, administration, judiciary, taxation and education. \u201cEven in the U.S., a senator from Hawaii has introduced a private member Bill on a similar concept,\u201d Arthakranti\u2019s Anil Bokil had then told The Hindu .\n\nThe outfit has estimated that the levy it is proposing can be collected through the banking channel rather than the tax collection authorities. Without leading to a loss of revenue, it will plug tax evasion and avoidance. Arthakranti\u2019s calculations show that the 2 per cent tax will yield Rs. 40,00,000 crore. The claim was contested by the eminent economist and former secretary-general of the FICCI, Rajiv Kumar, who said that at 2 per cent, the proposed new tax will yield Rs.14,00,000 crore. In 2014-15, the Centre\u2019s total tax revenue (revised estimates) were Rs. 9,084,63 crore.\n\nThis is not the first time such a proposal has been received by the Centre. Several governments have earlier discussed plans to abolish income tax but rejected them.\n\n\u201cThe group of Secretaries are unlikely to recommend that Arthakranti\u2019s proposal be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance \u2026 We did not think that the Prime Minister would favour it since there isn\u2019t a single precedent of a developed country adopting such an idea\u2026 ,\u201d the source said.",
