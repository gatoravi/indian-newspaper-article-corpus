    "text": "Saranya, 12, looks like an overgrown infant unable to move without the help of her parents. Same is the case of Athira, 17, with a swollen head and apparent physical ailments. Benumbed by the residuary harm caused by the banned pesticide endosulfan, they represent 188 living victims of the aerial spraying of the killer pesticide in the agricultural land here.\n\nAmong them, 77 are chronically ill. For the endosulfan victims of Kasaragod, the State government has approved all their demands after a hunger strike in Thiruvananthapuram. But the Muthalamada victims continue a neglected lot. \u2018\u2018As poor Dalit and tribal coolie workers, we remain unorganised. Struggling even to get a decent pay for the hard work in farm lands, we are incapable of organising a Kasaragod model struggle. The government continues to utter false promises,\u2019\u2019 M. Chandran, father of Saranya, said.\n\nAt Muthalamada, the pesticide was sprayed on individual trees with nozzles directed skywards. The person spraying gets affected almost instantly and the after-effects are transferred genetically to kids.",
