    "text": "Amid heavy police deployment, the indefinite fast launched by former Minister and Kapu leader Mudragada Padmanabham and his family members continued for the third day on Sunday.\n\nTension prevailed on many occasions when the police stopped the supporters of the movement from visiting the Kapu leader. At one point, Mr. Padmanabham perceived the heavy police deployment as an attempt to foil his fast. He locked himself in his room and denied entry to the police and revenue officials in the morning. The officials urged him to undergo a medical check-up, for which Mr. Padmanabham said he was healthy and that there was no need of conducting any check-up. He wondered why the police presence was increased in the village overnight and the officials were insisting on conducting medical tests on the third day of the fast.\n\nActor and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan suggested that direct talks should be held to resolve the issue. He stated in his Twitter message that the government should hold direct talks with Mr. Padmanabham and other Kapu leaders.\n\nKapu associations across the country have supported the fast.\n\nThe Delhi Kapu Sangham held a protest meet at DDA Park in Delhi and Kapu associations of Hyderabad sat on a protest in Dharna Chowk near Indira Park in Hyderabad.",
