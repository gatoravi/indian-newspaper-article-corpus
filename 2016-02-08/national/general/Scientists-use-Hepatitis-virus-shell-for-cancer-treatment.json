    "text": "Scientists at a US university have found a way to use an empty shell of a Hepatitis E virus to carry anti-cancer vaccines or drugs into the body.\n\nHepatitis E virus is feco-orally transmitted, so it can survive the passage through the digestive system, said Marie Stark, a graduate student working with professor Holland Cheng of the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California-Davis.\n\nUsing proteins\n\nMr. Cheng, Ms. Stark and colleagues prepared virus-like particles based on Hepatitis E proteins.\n\nThe particles do not contain any virus DNA, so they can\u2019t multiply and spread and cause infections.\n\nSuch particles could be used as vaccines that are delivered through food or drink. The idea is that you would drink the vaccine, and after passing through the stomach the virus-like particles would get absorbed in the intestine and deliver vaccines to the body.\n\nBut the particles could also be used to attack cancer.\n\nMs. Stark and Mr. Cheng did some tinkering with the proteins, so that they carry sticky cysteine amino acids on the outside. They could then chemically link other molecules to these cysteine groups.\n\nThey worked with a molecule called LXY-30, developed by researchers at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Centre, which is known to stick to breast cancer cells. The technique was tested in rodents as a way to target breast cancer.\n\nMarking cancer cells\n\nBy using a fluorescent marker, they could show that virus-like particles carrying LXY-30 could home in on breast cancer cells both in a laboratory dish and in a mouse.\n\nThe study findings were published recently in the journal Nanomedicine . \u2014 IANS\n\nVirus-like particles would get absorbed in the intestine and deliver vaccines to the body",
