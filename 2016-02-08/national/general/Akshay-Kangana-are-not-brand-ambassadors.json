    "text": "A controversy has erupted over the role of Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar and Kangana Ranaut in the International Fleet Review (IFR) under way in Visakhapatnam.\n\nThe two actors took part in the opening ceremony of the IFR at the INS Sathavahana Stadium on Friday. The Navy, in a statement issued after the ceremony, said: \u201cThe highlight of the event was the presence of Bollywood stars Akshay Kumar and Kangana Ranaut, the Brand Ambassadors of IFR, at the event.\u201d\n\nHowever, this was contradicted by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday who said the actors were guests. \u201cBrand ambassadors have to sell a brand right from the beginning. I don\u2019t think that there is any selling by these two [Akshay Kumar and Kangana],\u201d Mr. Parrikar said in response to questions from reporters.\n\nHe added that they were definitely invited ... \u201cbut there is no contract and nothing has been paid to them.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Navy officials clarified that the actors were not ambassadors and were only invited as guests.\n\nThe incident comes close on the heels of a controversy over the \u201cdilution\u201d of Beating Retreat ceremony in New Delhi.",
