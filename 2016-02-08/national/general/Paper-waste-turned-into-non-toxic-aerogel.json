    "text": "Aerogel, finest insulation material\n\nIn a world\u2019s first, scientists have successfully converted paper waste into green cellulose aerogels that are non-toxic, ultra-light, flexible, extremely strong and water repellent.\n\nThis novel material is ideal for applications such as oil spill cleaning, heat insulation as well as packaging, and it can potentially be used as coating materials for drug delivery and as smart materials for various biomedical applications, researchers said.\n\n\u201cAerogels, which are among the lightest solid materials known to man, are one of the finest insulation materials available. Traditional aerogels are mainly made of silica, which is not environment-friendly,\u201d said Duong Hai from National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\n\u201cOur team developed a simple, cost-effective and fast method of converting paper waste into aerogels. In addition to low thermal conductivity, these novel aerogels have several unique features, one of which is super high oil absorption capacity \u2014 it is up to four times higher than commercial sorbents available in the market,\u201d Hai said.\n\nResearchers also developed an eco-friendly process to convert the waste. \u201cOur fabrication process uses 70 per cent less energy, produces fewer polluting emissions into the air and water, as well as uses less dioxins in the chlorine bleaching process,\u201d said Hai. \u2014 PTI",
