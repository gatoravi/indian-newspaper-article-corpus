Naveen confessed to committing the crime.\n\nThe DCP said: \u201cOn February 2, Naveen went to Arzoo\u2019s college to pick her up and the two left in his car. They went to a mall in Saket and a few other places after which Naveen disclosed to her his plans of distributing cards for his upcoming wedding with another girl. Though she was aware that he was going to marry someone else, Arzoo got infuriated after Naveen sought her help to distribute cards and an argument broke out.\u201d\n\nLate last year, both the families mutually agreed that since they hailed from the same village, Arzoo and Naveen were \u201clike brother and sister\u201d and could not marry each other.\n\nThey, however, kept their relationship a secret. Investigators said the secrecy often caused arguments between the two.\n\nOn the day of the suspected murder, Naveen felt intimidated as the victim threatened to make their relationship public and also inform Naveen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e about it. Sources claimed that the victim was pregnant, another secret she threatened to reveal. However, Mr. Singh said the fact could be ascertained only after an autopsy.\n\n\u201cAfter his efforts to convince Arzoo failed, Naveen drove the car to an isolated stretch in Nangal Dawat village close to the airport in South-West Delhi. There, he strangled her with a \u2018dupatta\u2019 before stuffing the body in the boot of the car,\u201d the DCP said.\n\nHowever, after murdering the girl, Naveen could not find a suitable place to dump the body and brought it home around 7 p.m., said the police.\n\n\u201cHe woke up around 3 a.m. the next day when other family members were asleep. He then placed the body on the grill of the ventilation shaft,\u201d the DCP said.\n\nWhile Arzoo\u2019s family alleged that Naveen\u2019s family too was involved in the murder, police said so far there was no evidence linking them to the case.\n\nNaveen felt intimidated as the victim threatened to make their relationship public",
