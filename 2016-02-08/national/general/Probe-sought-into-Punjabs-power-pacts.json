    "text": "Pointing the finger at the process adopted for signing the power purchase agreements in Punjab, senior leader and former Punjab Congress president Partap Singh Bajwa on Sunday demanded a probe by an independent agency into the functioning of the power sector and process of setting up private thermal plants in the State.\n\nMr. Bajwa said all units of the Lehra Mohabbat thermal plant were closed only to purchase costly power from the private sector. \u201cPower produced by public sector thermal plants was cheaper. But the Punjab Power Corporation was bound to purchase a specified quantity from private sector plants or pay them compensation under the \u201cpower purchase agreements\u201d even if it had to shut down its own plants where the demand was less,\u201d he said. Mr. Bajwa accused Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal of destroying the State\u2019s power sector.\n\n\u201cIt should be explained why more plants had not been set up in the public sector,\u201d he said.",
