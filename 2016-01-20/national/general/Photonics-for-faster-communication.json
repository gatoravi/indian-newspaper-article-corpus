    "text": "BENGALURU: Scientists from the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru are working on two projects in the area of photonic integrated circuits.\n\nIn the first, researchers and scientists at CeNSE are building a next-generation, multi-crore processor. It\u2019s hard to imagine a world without microprocessors. These ubiquitous little chips drive our technology and are embedded everywhere, from phones to laptops to DVDs and rockets. But at its very core, each unit is still electrical; it has millions of transistors connected with copper lines. What if you replaced the copper lines with photonic components? It would exponentially improve the power of microprocessors. Now, scientists from CeNSE, in a project supported by the DRDO, are trying to develop indigenous technology for high-speed optical interconnect technology.",
