We are of the view that charges against Mr. Tiwari are politically motivated. The Samajwadi Party government is acting as if it was the government for just one particular community,\u201d said Ram Naresh Shrivastava, a Hindu Mahasabha leader.\n\nSeveral members of his family also approached the Union Home Ministry appealing to revoke the NSA.\n\nThe Hindu Mahasabha leader\u2019s remarks on the Prophet had triggered protests",
