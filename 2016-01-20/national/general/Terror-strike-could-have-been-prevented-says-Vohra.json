Vohra said on Tuesday that Pathankot terror strike could have been prevented if lessons had been learnt from previous such attacks with focus on securing the country's border with Pakistan which is not yet \u201cwell guarded.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the infiltrations by terror groups through the international border (IB), including the recent attack on Pathankot air base, Mr. Vohra said the BSF with its limited capacities cannot guard the IB (in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab) which is a long stretch of over 200 km.\n\nThe Governor who was here to deliver a key note address on seventh National Investigation Agency day, noted that the five-six terror attacks which took place since September 2013 via Kathua-Samba districts through the IB, part of which falls in J&K, should have been followed up as closely as the Pathankot attack.\n\nHe said the attack on Dina Nagar police station in Gurdaspur could have been avoided, if the previous terror attacks were subjected to a tight investigation. \u201c...and if Dina Nagar would have been properly investigated, Pathankot, I am sure would have been almost impossible because we would have been able to know the routes taken by the terror groups to infiltrate the IB. I also hold very strongly that IB is not well guarded,\u201d Mr. Vohra said.",
