    "text": "Over a year after refusing to reconsider the death penalty awarded to the Red Fort terror attack case convict Mohammed Arif, alias Ashfaq, the Supreme Court changed its mind on Tuesday, and said it would be a miscarriage of justice if he was not given an opportunity to file a fresh review petition for a \u201climited oral hearing in open court.\u201d\n\nA five-judge Constitution Bench, led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, allowed the convict, represented by senior advocate R. Basant and advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, a month to file the petition and include additional grounds in his defence. The Bench said Ashfaq was the only death row convict who did not get the benefit of a majority judgment passed by another five-judge Constitution Bench on September 2, 2014, which allowed review petitions of condemned prisoners to be heard in open court rather than inside judges\u2019 chambers.\n\nThe Bench reasoned that though Ashfaq was the lead petitioner among the death row convicts, including those in the 2000 Dharmapuri bus burning case that led to the September 2 judgment, he was the only one who did not benefit from the favourable verdict.\n\nThe September 2 ruling had been implicit in its direction that the verdict would not apply to condemned prisoners whose curative petitions had already been dismissed by the apex court. Ashfaq\u2019s curative petition had already been dismissed on January 23, 2014.\n\nChief Justice Thakur said a \u201cconcession\u201d may be allowed to the condemned man in order to avoid even the slightest possibility of an error.\n\nThe court allowed the convict in the Red Fort terror attack case a month\u2019s time",
