    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to defer hearing on the Uttar Pradesh\u2019s plea, challenging the appointment of Lokayukta in the State due to the nonavailability of senior lawyer Kapil Sibal.\n\nA Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi firmly said the State cannot be accommodated \u201cbeyond a point\u201d.\n\n\u201cMake another arrangement. We are listing it for tomorrow,\u201d Justice Gogoi said.\n\nAdjournment sought\n\nThe counsel for U.P. sought adjournment on the ground that Mr. Sibal, who has been leading it in the matter, is busy arguing before a five-judge Constitution Bench which is hearing a batch of petitions related to the Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly crisis.\n\nExtraordinary powers\n\nThe case relates to the controversy behind the appointment of Virendra Singh, former judge of the Allahabad High Court, as the State's Lokayukta by the Supreme Court by using its extraordinary powers under the Constitution.\n\nConstitutional authority\n\nThe court on December 16 last year had exercised its Constitutional authority and appointed Justice Singh as Lokayukta, saying the Constitutional functionaries \u2014 the Chief Minister, the Opposition Leader and Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court \u2014 had failed to comply with its orders by not appointing the chief of the state's anti-graft ombudsman.\n\nHowever, a fresh plea, which would be heard on Wednesday, was filed by journalist Sachchidanad Gupta highlighting several newspaper reports alleging that the Uttar Pradesh government had \u201cconcealed facts\u201d about Justice Singh and \u201cplayed fraud\u201d on the apex court.\n\nPetition challenges the appointment of Virendra Singh as the State's anti-graft ombudsman",
