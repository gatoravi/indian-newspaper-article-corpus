    "text": "A five-judge Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India Tirath Singh Thakur, which allowed Red Fort attack case convict Mohammed Arif alias Ashfaq to file a fresh review petition to fight for his life, said a \u201cconcession\u201d might be allowed to the condemned man in order to avoid even the slightest possibility of an error.\n\nThe September 2 ruling had been implicit in its direction that the verdict would not apply to condemned prisoners whose curative petitions had already been dismissed by the Supreme Court. Ashfaq\u2019s curative petition had been dismissed on January 23, 2014.\n\nThree Army personnel were killed in the Red Fort terror strike in 2000. The majority judgment written by Justice Rohinton Nariman, who was also a judge on Chief Justice Thakur\u2019s Bench, had dismissed the convict\u2019s arguments that he had spent over 13 years in jail and this, in effect, meant that he had suffered a double punishment.",
