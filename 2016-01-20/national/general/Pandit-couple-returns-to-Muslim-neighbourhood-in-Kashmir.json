He says his Muslim neighbours do not allow politics to interfere in their personal relations.\u2014 PHOTO: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.\n\nA Kashmiri Pandit couple is back in the Kashmir Valley. What makes the return of Omkar Razdan (70) and Vijay Bazaz Razdan (65) unique is they refused to take the Prime Minister\u2019s package. Instead, they preferred to move to a Muslim neighbourhood.\n\nOmkar Razdan and Vijay Bazaz Razdan, son-in-law and daughter of the widely-read Kashmiri Pandit, Prem Nath Bazaz, have constructed a three-storey house in the Muslim-majority Humhama colony of Srinagar to dispel the myth that the two communities cannot live together.\n\n\u201cIt was a conscious decision not to live in a separate settlement or colony, as it goes against the idea of Kashmiriyat. Kashmir was an abode of communal harmony when the minorities were attacked in 1947 in other parts of India. Not a single Pandit was killed or displaced then,\u201d said Mr. Razdan.\n\nMr. Razdan said he grew up listening to folklores on Hindu-Muslim harmony. The couple has named the house Noor Augur (Spring of light), to relive the past.\n\n\u201cWe travel by public transport in Srinagar. We get a warm feeling. I leave my keys with my Muslim electrician when I travel to New Delhi,\u201d said Mr. Razadan, who has authored the book, Trauma of Kashmir and Untold Realities .\n\nA retired chief engineer, Mr. Razdan was moved by the efforts of his Muslim neighbourhood to rescue him and his wife in the floods of 2014. \u201cIt may be astonishing but I chanted Islamic verses as Muslims chanted \u2018Har Har Mahadev\u2019 in our joint effort to escape the floods,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHis wife said she was moved by the verses she hears every morning from a nearby mosque. \u201cIt is so soothing. When we introduce ourselves as Pandits, we are offered free vegetables and grocery at times. This is not possible anywhere else,\u201d she said.\n\nThe duo has taken the political reality of Kashmir in its stride to realise the dream of living and dying in the Valley. \u201cOn the walls of the mosque, we see the words \u2018Go India, Go back\u2019 but the locals do not allow politics to interfere in our personal relations,\u201d said Mr. Razdan.\n\nThe mass migration of Pandits in 1990 was engineered by \u201cfringe elements,\u201d according to him. \u201cTill date no expert has established that an entire community was behind Pandits\u2019 migration. I believe some were used as compulsive tools,\u201d he added.\n\nThe dream to construct the house was realised after Ms. Razdan refused to sell her 10 marlas of land in the Valley. \u201cOne reason I stayed in the Muslim colony was my desire to relate with my youthful days,\u201d said Mr. Razdan, who is planning to open up his house\u2019s attic to a computer centre for the economically weaker sections.\n\nHe is a frequent visitor to temples of Ganpatyaar in the old city and Kheer Bhawani in north Kashmir\u2019s Tulmul temples. \u201cI have requested my wife to conduct my last rites in Kashmir,\u201d said Mr. Razdan.",
