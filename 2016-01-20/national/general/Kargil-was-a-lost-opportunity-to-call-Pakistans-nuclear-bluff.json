    "text": "The Kargil conflict of 1999 was an opportunity to call Pakistan\u2019s nuclear bluff but India failed to do so for political reasons, says Lt. Gen. Mohinder Puri (retd.), who played a critical role in the battlefield as the commander of 8 Mountain Division.\n\nLt. Gen. Puri\u2019s observations find resonance even today given India\u2019s dilemma in dealing with continued cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, and the uncertainties that nuclear weapons have introduced into the South Asian security scenario. In fact, the nuclear discourse in the subcontinent has been further convoluted in recent times with Pakistan introducing tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear warheads into the equation.\n\n\u201cIt could have perhaps been escalated into a wider war. Perhaps the politician did not want to enlarge the scope. The Pakistanis overplayed the nuclear thing and we succumbed to it. It was time to call the bluff but we didn\u2019t. Nobody is going to go for nuclear war in this age,\u201d Lt. Gen. Puri said in a conversation with The Hindu .\n\nHe was General Officer Commanding (GOC), 8 Mountain Division, which conducted operations in the crucial Drass-Mushkoh sector during \u2018Operation Vijay.\u2019 His personal recollection of the battle, titled Kargil: Turning the Tide , was released recently.\n\n\u2018The Pakistanis overplayed the nuclear thing and we succumbed to it.\u2019",
