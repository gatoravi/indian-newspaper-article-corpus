Earlier, the National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the Bihar government, on the basis of the report.\n\nIn distress\n\nMs. Chakraburtty stated in her survey report that at least 2,799 prisoners are \u201cin need\u201d of legal aid. She interviewed 30,070 prisoners in 58 jails, including 26 terminally ill and 102 mentally challenged. The number of prisoners in need of medical attention was 176, the report stated. Besides custodial torture and denial of justice, the report focuses on the physical condition of the inmates, the condition of juveniles and aged prisoners.",
