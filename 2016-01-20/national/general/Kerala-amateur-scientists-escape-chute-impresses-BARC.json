    "text": "High-rise building residents can sit in the chute to slide down to ground floor\n\nA escape system developed by 60-year-old amateur Kerala scientist M.C. David has impressed a team of the Mumbai-headquartered Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).\n\nThe innovative escape system, a simple spiral sliding chute, for high-rise buildings is all set to get its first work order from the BARC.\n\nLast week, a four-member team of officials from the research centre spent a day with David and found what he had to offer at his residence near here.\n\nMK Stanly, the team leader from BARC, said they were hugely impressed by David\u2019s innovative escape shute.\n\nFire-resistant\n\nDavid claimed the sliding chute, that can be made using fire-resistant fibre glass or concrete, can facilitate a quick and safe escape for people trapped in high-rise buildings. The chute can be built by the side of existing staircases of buildings, he added.\n\nIn case of fire in a high-rise building, the residents just need to sit in the sliding chute to come down to the ground floor four times faster than stairs, he explained.\n\n\u201cWe have recommended this to our higher-ups for suitable action and for going ahead. We read about this innovative product in the newspapers and I was asked by our top official to go and have a look,\u201d Stanly said.\n\nThe BARC has a dozen buildings which are more than three decades old.\n\nThe team has zeroed in on David\u2019s shute and very soon would get the nod for fixing it at a two-storeyed canteen building on the BARC campus. \u2014 IANS",
