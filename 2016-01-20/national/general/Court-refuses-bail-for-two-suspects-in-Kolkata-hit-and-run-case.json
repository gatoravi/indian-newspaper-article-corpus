Then why have others been implicated in this case, they asked.\n\nHowever, public prosecutor argued that investigation in the case was at an early stage and custody of the accused was necessary.\n\nDismissing their bail plea, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sanjay Ranjan Pal remanded them in police custody till January 30.\n\nThe police charged the suspects under sections 302 [murder], 120 (b) [criminal conspiracy] 304 [attempt to murder] 427 [mischief causing damage] and 201 [causing disappearance of evidence].",
