She should not die a half-widow. The funeral will give her peace of mind,\u201d said Ms. Dar.\n\nMs Dar was in Class 9 when her father was picked up by the Army\u2019s 35 Rashtriya Rifles on January 18, 2002.\n\n\u201cWe returned disappointed from every jail, every army camp and every police station where we searched for our father \u2026 However, it is a unique case where the government presumed the victim to be dead,\u201d said Ms. Dar.\n\nA Special Investigation Team probing Dar\u2019s custodial disappearance closed the case on November 26, 2015, concluding that Major Kishore Malhotra (now Brigadier) abducted him from his residence and \u201chis body could have been disposed of.\u201d An arrest warrant was issued against the officer by a local court.\n\nScores of people gathered at the Rawalpora school ground for the funeral. A spontaneous shutdown was observed in the area and several protesters raised anti-government slogans and waved flags. Separatist leaders like Hurriyat leader Pir Saifullah and JKLF chief Yasin Malik also offered prayers.\n\n\u201cThe struggle to search and identify our loved ones will continue,\u201d Parveena Ahangar, chairperson of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP), a body of families searching for missing relatives, told The Hindu . \u201cNo closure equals a real closure where justice is delivered.\u201d\n\nSearches continue\n\nMs. Ahangar claimed that despite Islamic decrees allowing \u2018half-widows\u2019 to remarry, they preferred to continue the search for their missing husbands.\n\n\u201cOur demand is to subject the bodies buried in unmarked graves to DNA test. Identify the graves if there is a match,\u201d said Ms. Ahangar.\n\nJ-K Coalition of Civil Society, a rights body, has documented more than 7,000 graves and an estimated 8,000 disappearances in Jammu and Kashmir since the 1990s.\n\nIt marked the formal closure of the first case in Kashmir where there are over 7,000 documented cases of \u201cdisappeared\u201d people",
