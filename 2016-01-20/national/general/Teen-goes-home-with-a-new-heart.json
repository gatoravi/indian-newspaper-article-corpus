However, we will have to keep an eye on her progress. A team member has visited her place to check hygiene since she is on drugs that prevent heart rejection but at the same time make her prone to infections,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Agarwal, head of paediatric cardiac surgery at Fortis hospital.\n\nHer doctors will keep a close eye on the progress. Given her vulnerability to infections, she has also been advised to not resume college for at least six months, Dr. Agarwal added.\n\nOn the advice of doctors, the D\u2019Souzas have created a special room to protect Sweden from dust and infections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a glass cabin with an air-conditioner. Everything in the room is new,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Souza, who works as a watchman. He also expressed gratitude to the business family that took care of Sweden\u2019s medical expenses.\n\nDr. Agarwal said while the six heart transplants had been carried out in Fortis, there was much more to be done in terms of spreading awareness.\n\nHer doctors said they were working on increasing awareness of transplants",
