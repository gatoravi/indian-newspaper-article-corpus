They could not do anything in 15 years and now they want me to solve all their problems within 15 months... Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s unfair to me,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\n\u201cThere is a long list of problems. There has been no development,\u201d he said at a rally at Bodofanagar here.\n\nHe came down heavily on the Congress government in Assam and the previous UPA government at the Centre for \u201cfailing\u201d to fulfil dreams and aspiration of the people.\n\nMr. Modi announced that the people of Karbi community living in the plains of Assam and Bodos living in hill areas would be granted tribal status and the process has already been started.\n\nElection to Assam\u2019s 126-member Assembly is expected to be held in April-May. \u2014 PTI",
