Kumaraswamy which led to the exoneration of Ms. Jayalalithaa, N. Sasikala Natarajan, V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarasi in the corruption case. Principally, the State government asks whether the bare fact that it was neither considered nor ignored as the \u201csole prosecuting agency\u201d in the corruption case would by itself vitiate the HC judgment.\n\nThe State wants the Supreme Court to address what would be the effect of not repairing this omission throughout the appeal hearings in the HC till they were disposed of. The State\u2019s document, filed by advocate Joseph Aristotle and settled by senior advocate B.V. Acharya, asks whether the appeals were not vitiated as the duly appointed Public Prosecutor was \u201cnever given the opportunity\u201d of an oral hearing. His role was reduced to just handing over written submission, that too on the orders of the Supreme Court, at the fag end of the appeals in the HC. The State government pointed out that the acquittal can be set aside by just correcting the \u201ctotalling mistake\u201d to show that the value of disproportionate assets of the accused comes to Rs. 16.32 crore, that is 76.7 p. c. of the income, against the 8.12 p.c. arrived at by the HC.\n\nThe document lists 16 points of contention against Kumaraswamy judgment",
