    "text": "Severe resource crunch and alleged financial indiscipline are threatening to derail the routine functions of the 1,250-odd temples and other financial transactions of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB).\n\nA financial status report prepared by the board accounts wing on December 10 last said a Rs.13-crore shortfall in the income from Sabarimala coupled with excessive spending would upset the functions of temples and also the honouring of commitments such as conduct of pujas and disbursal of salary and pension of employees.\n\nThe report accessed by The Hindu said the annual expenditure for conducting pujas, payment of salary, pension and bills of civil works amounted to Rs. 220 crore. The returns from temples other than Sabarimala had been estimated at Rs. 110 crore and the remaining component was being borne by the net income from Sabarimala, which is perhaps the only main source of income for the board. The fall in income is likely to impact all plans in the current and next financial year.\n\nEven when the board was trying hard to meet its routine expenses, executive engineers and contractors who had taken up civil works were mounting pressure to clear the bills of works executed by them. As per the budget estimates, the allocation for civil works for the current year, except Sabarimala, is Rs.39.69 crore. But the board, within six months, had sanctioned civil works worth Rs.40.73 crore, exceeding the budget allocation.\n\nFall in income from Sabarimala likely to affect plans in current and next financial years",
