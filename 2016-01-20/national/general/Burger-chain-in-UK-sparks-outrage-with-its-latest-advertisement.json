    "text": "London: A leading burger chain in the UK has launched a new campaign to tempt vegetarians to eat meat, outraging vegans, forcing the company to apologise and take down some of the offensive billboards.\n\nGourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) has come under fire for a series of advertisements which vegans and vegetarians have branded \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nThe adverts, seen mostly at London Underground stations and trains, include taglines such as \u201cVegetarians, resistance is futile,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll always remember when you gave up being a vegetarian\u201d, The Independent reported.\n\nPeople have taken to social media to condemn GBK\u2019s ads, coining the hashtag #gourmetmurderkitchen to highlight what has been perceived to be a flippant attitude towards the consumption of meat.\n\n\u201c@gbkburgers utterly offensive advertising. Offending a huge customer base is a huge mistake #gourmetmurderkitchen,\u201d one of the commuters, who saw the advert vented out at the burger chain. \u201c@gbkburgers well done on insulting your customers with your awful marketing,\u201d another tweeted.\n\n\u201c@gbkburgers Loved GBK but apparently we\u2019re not welcome.\u201d However, GBK quickly responded to the flood of complaints, confirming they will be taking down \u201csome\u201d of the adverts.\n\nApology\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been reading the reactions to our latest advertising campaign and needless to say, we\u2019re quite taken aback. Our intentions were light-hearted and not meant to cause any offence, but clearly we have, and for that we apologise,\u201d GBK said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.\n\n\u201cHaving read all your comments and messages, we\u2019ve made the decision to take down some of the adverts,\u201d said in the post. \u2014 PTI",
