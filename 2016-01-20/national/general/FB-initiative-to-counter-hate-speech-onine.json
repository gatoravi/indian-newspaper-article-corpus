In order to make change, everyone needs to feel empowered to share their voice and exercise #civilcourage,\u201d read the message on the initiative\u2019s Facebook home page. According to Facebook, it will invest \u20ac1 million in European non-governmental organisations that are fighting online extremism.\n\n\u201cFacebook is not a place for the dissemination of hate speech or incitement to violence. With this new initiative, we can better understand and respond to the challenges of extremist speech on the Internet,\u201d said Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, in Berlin.\n\nLondon-based think tank, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, will lead this partnership between Facebook, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the Amadeu Antonio Foundation and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence. Facebook has faced complaints in the past that it has not done enough to take down racist and xenophobic hate speech.\n\nIn November last year, German prosecutors launched an investigation into the European head of Facebook over it\u2019sthe social media platform\u2019s failure to remove racist hate speech. \u2014 IANS",
