Criminals had become emboldened ever since the coalition government of the RJD-JD(U) and the Congress came to power in Bihar, he said.\n\nMr. Modi was reacting after two JD(U) MLAs \u2014 Sarfaraj Alam and Bima Bharti \u2014 hit headlines for wrong reasons recently.\n\nMr. Alam, an MLA from Jokihat Assembly constituency in Araria district, was named as an accused in a complaint over allegedly misbehaving with a couple in a Guwahati-Rajdhani train on Sunday night. However, the MLA has denied the charges and claimed that he was not even travelling in the train.\n\nMs. Bharti, an MLA from Rupauli Assembly constituency in Purnia district, was accused of helping her husband Awadhesh Mandal, against whom several criminal cases have been lodged, and getting him released from the Maranga police station.\n\nHowever, Ms. Bharti denied the charges, saying she did not know how her husband got out of police custody. Later, the police station in-charge, Shivshankar Kumar, was placed under suspension for \u201claxity in duty.\u201d\n\nEarlier, following the daylight murders of two engineers and a Patna-based jeweller and several incidents of extortion, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar underscored that law and order \u201cwould be maintained at all costs\u201d in the State.\n\nExtortion again\n\nHowever, incidents of crime continue in the same trend. On Tuesday, the Alamganj police in Patna filed a case following a complaint of extortion registered by doctor-couple Dr. Raj Kishore Prasad and Dr. Hemrani Devnath.\n\nThey stated that criminals had demanded Rs. 10 lakh from them.\n\n\u201cThese are litmus tests for the Chief Minister. A BJP delegation will also meet Governor Ram Nath Kovind soon to seek his intervention in checking the spiralling crime,\u201d said Mr. Modi.",
