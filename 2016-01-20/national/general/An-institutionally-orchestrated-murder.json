    "text": "For the third day in a row, the University of Hyderabad witnessed protests by student organisations over the suicide of Dalit research scholar, Rohith Vemula on January 17. Vemula, along with four other Dalit students, was expelled from the university hostel and barred from entering the administrative building, though they were allowed to attend classes.\n\nA two-member fact-finding team of the Human Resource Development Ministry visited the campus.\n\nBut it was Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit that assumed significance. It was a crowd of no fewer than 200 students who met Mr. Gandhi.\n\nIn a 20-minute speech, he said: \u201cIn this case, the V-C and the Minister in Delhi have not been fair, and the youngster was caused so much pain that he had no other option but to kill himself.\u201d\n\nWhile the student had committed suicide, \u201cthe condition for his suicide was created by the V-C, the Minister and the institution.\u201d\n\nMr. Gandhi said students should be allowed to express their political opinions on campus. The students told him that Vemula\u2019s death should be considered an \u201cinstitutionally orchestrated murder.\u201d\n\nMr. Gandhi also demanded adequate compensation. \u201cCompensation means, respect, job and financial support. As the student who killed himself was his family\u2019s hope for a better future, that future should be provided to the family in terms of compensation.\u201d",
