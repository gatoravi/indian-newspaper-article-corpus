    "text": ": With only a few days left for the final hearing on appeals against the acquittal of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to commence in the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government on Tuesday filed point-by-point highlights of the \u201cerrors\u201d made by the State High Court in deciding the disproportionate assets case in favour of the AIADMK leader and three co-accused.\n\nThe seven-page document listed 16 points of contention against the May 11, 2015 judgment of Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy which led to the exoneration of Ms. Jayalalithaa, N. Sasikala Natarajan, V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarasi in the corruption case.\n\nPrincipally, the State government asks whether the bare fact that it was neither considered nor ignored as the \u201csole prosecuting agency\u201d in the corruption case would not by itself vitiate the High Court judgment.\n\nThe State wants the Supreme Court to address what would be the effect of not repairing this omission throughout the appeal hearings in the High Court till they were disposed of.\n\nThe State\u2019s document, filed by advocate Joseph Aristotle and settled by senior advocate B.V. Acharya, asks whether the appeals were not vitiated as the duly appointed Public Prosecutor was \u201cnever given the opportunity\u201d of an oral hearing.\n\nHis role was reduced to just handing over written submission, that too on the orders of the Supreme Court, at the fag end of the appeals in the High Court.\n\nThe State government pointed out that the acquittal can be set aside by just correcting the \u201ctotalling mistake. \u201d",
