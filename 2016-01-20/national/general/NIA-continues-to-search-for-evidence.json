While four bodies were found at the airbase, the confusion about the presence of one or two more terrorists at the Airmen\u2019s billet which was blown up persists.\n\nAll the NIA officers can say for now is that they picked up a lump of flesh from the building and sent a sample to the forensic laboratory. Its report is awaited. They have also preserved the DNA samples.\n\nApart from four AK-47 rifles found on the four bodies, no other weapon has been recovered. A mobile phone recovered from the rubble turned out to be an Airbase employee\u2019s, said an NIA official.\n\n\u201cApart from the recoveries made by the Air Force personnel after the operation ended, there have been no new recoveries. We are still searching for evidence,\u201d said a senior NIA official.\n\nThe entry point identified by NIA, from where the terrorists could have sneaked into India, falls in the Gurdaspur sector in Punjab. \u201cWe zeroed in on the area after measuring the distance from the airbase and the circuitous route the terrorists took to reach there,\u201d said the official. \u201cThey travelled a distance of nearly 40 kilometres from the border point to the airbase.\u201d\n\nThe official said that after the first set of footprints were lifted after being alerted by villagers near Bamiyal village, the NIA collected five more samples. They have been sent for forensic analysis to match them with the shoes worn by the terrorists.\n\nA team of NIA officials has been rummaging through the damaged airmen\u2019s billet. \u201cWe have stationed a team at the airbase and are questioning all the personnel who were in the vicinity or were present there during or before the attacks took place,\u201d said the official.",
