Bardhanin New Delhi on Tuesday.\u2014 Photo: PTI\n\nLeaders across political parties, including the former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and H.D. Deve Gowda, converged at the memorial meeting of late CPI leader A.B. Bardhan, who passed away recently, here on Tuesday.\n\nCongress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh, AIDMK leader M. Thambidurai, NCP leader D.P. Tripathi, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury and his predecessor Prakash Karat, shared the stage with CPI leaders to recall the legacy of Bardhan.\n\n\u201cHe was in the forefront of opposing communalism,\u201d Mr. Yechury said about Bardhan, even as he shared some anecdotes about him.\n\n\u2018Committed leader\u2019\n\nWhile Dr. Singh chose not to speak, the others shared their memories of Bardhan, remembering him as a committed Communist leader who led a simple life, often staying in a room of the party\u2019s office.\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, Mr. Yechury said that the CPI (M)\u2019s aim was to \u201csave West Bengal\u201d from the Mamata Banerjee government and to \u201csave India\u201d from the BJP government. \u201cWho comes or does not come with us, it is for them to decide,\u201d he said on whether the party would ally with the Congress in Bengal.\n\nHe also demanded that Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya be sacked in the wake of the suicide of a Dalit student of Hyderabad University.\n\nJanata Dal (United) leader K.C. Tyagi made extensive references to current controversies, saying Bardhan\u2019s passing away was a jolt in such a situation.\n\n\u2018Time of crisis\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is a time of crisis. People\u2019s food habits and religious beliefs are being questioned. Not even in colonial times was the situation so bad. In Hyderabad, a Dalit boy has been forced to commit suicide. The minority status of the AMU and the Jamia Millia Islamia is being questioned,\u201d he said.",
