    "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday extended the interim bail of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband till April 29 in two criminal cases registered by the Gujarat police and CBI, involving alleged embezzlement of funds.\n\nA Bench comprising Justices Anil R. Dave, F.M.I. Kalifulla and V. Gopala Gowda, also referred the matters to Chief Justice T.S. Thakur for constituting another Bench to hear them.\n\nIt said the Chief Justice would set up a regular Bench for hearing them as the present combination of judges were not sitting together on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe Bench declined the plea of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for the couple, that instead of any particular duration, the interim bail be extended till further orders.",
