    "text": "The Rs. 900-crore loan extended by the IDBI Bank to Kingfisher Airlines was sanctioned by top bank officials, despite poor credit rating. The case registered by the CBI last July on a complaint by the bank says the company had moved another application for a corporate loan of Rs. 950 crore on October 1, 2009. Five days later, giving reference to Mr. Mallya\u2019s meeting with a top IDBI official, the firm\u2019s CFO, A. Raghunathan, requested for release of a short-term loan of Rs. 150 crore.\n\n\u201cOn the same day, a memorandum was put up to the credit committee [comprising the then CMD and two members] and the facility was sanctioned, though the company was having negative financials and a negative net-worth..., and the borrower being a new client did not satisfy the conditions stipulated in the corporate loan policy of the bank,\u201d says the CBI.\n\nOn November 4, 2009, Mr. Raghunathan wrote another letter giving reference of a meeting between Mr. Mallya and the bank\u2019s CMD and sought ad hoc release of Rs. 200 crore pending sanction of the corporate loan to \u201cmeet critical obligations to overseas vendors\u201d. The amount was later subsumed in the corporate loan.",
