The seed packets would be of 450 grams, including 120 grams refugia.\n\nAgriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said a nine-member committee was set up to recommend the maximum sale price of Bt cotton seeds. \u201cAfter taking into consideration the seed value, licence fees, including one-time, and recurring royalty (trait value), trade margins and other taxes government declared the maximum sale price of Bt. cotton seed on Wednesday,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Singh said that earlier there was no uniformity in pricing of Bt cotton seeds across the country, hence the Central government had recently intervened and issued a Cotton Seed Price (Control) Order, 2015, to fix a uniform price of Bt cotton seed across the States in the country for the benefit of farmers.\n\nHe said that based on the representations, the department also made a reference to the Competition Commission of India for investigation of dominance of Mahyco Monsanto Biotech Ltd (MMBL) and abuse of monopoly in Bt cotton technology so as to ensure competition in the market.",
