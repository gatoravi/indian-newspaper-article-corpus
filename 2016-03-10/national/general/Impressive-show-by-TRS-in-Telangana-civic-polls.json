    "text": "The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti created history by winning Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations and the Achampet Nagara panchayat in Telangana on Wednesday.\n\nRepeating its recent electoral performance in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and the by-election to the Narayankhed Assembly seat, the TRS wrested the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation comfortably, unseated the Left parties in the Khammam civic body and shocked the grand alliance of Opposition parties in Achampet Nagara panchayat bagging all the 20 wards.\n\nContinuing its winning streak, TRS candidates won in 44 divisions of Warangal while eight rebel TRS nominees also triumphed in the 58-member strong House. The Congress had to settle for four divisions, while the BJP and the CPI (M) candidates won one division each.\n\nIn Khammam, the scene was no different as the TRS swept past the simple majority, bagging 34 out of 50 divisions. The Congress managed 10 divisions while the Left parties, which once held sway over the civic body, could win only two seats each. The most remarkable victory was in Achampet Nagara Panchayat in Mahabubnagar. In the 20-member newly formed civic body, the TRS won all the wards defeating the grand alliance of the Opposition parties. Out of the 20 wards, 11 wards were won by women candidates.\n\nWins Warangal, Khammam, Achampet civic bodies",
