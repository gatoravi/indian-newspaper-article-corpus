    "text": "A Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who authored the May 13 verdict, gave the States six weeks to respond. States, including Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, are seeking a review of the judgment.\n\nTurning on its head the judgment\u2019s reasoning that photographs of politicians on government advertisements will lead to \u201cpersonality cults\u201d, Mr. Rohatgi said advertisements featuring the photos of one personality alone, like the Prime Minister, is more likely to give birth to personality cults and is \u201cpernicious.\u201d \u201cThere is no difference between a Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers or Chief Ministers in a federal structure. There is no basis for you saying that these three [PM, President and CJI] alone are exempted. There is no intrinsic difference between one minister or the other\u201d Mr. Rohatgi submitted. He argued that a picture has a far more visual impact than \u201ccold-blooded written words.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of \u2018information\u2019 under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution includes not only the written word but also pictures,\u201d Mr. Rohatgi said.\n\n\u201cAdvertising campaigns for polio, health policies, cultural events need faces so that people will be attracted to look at them. This court should not have got into the sanctity of it [using photos in advertisements], but having done so, how can this court say only these three are exempted?\u201d Mr. Rohatgi argued. The A-G said the Supreme Court should be open to correct its own errors. The Bench has reserved the case for final orders.",
