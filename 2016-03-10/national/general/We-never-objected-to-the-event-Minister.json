    "text": "After Delhi Art and Culture Minister Kapil Mishra\u2019s letter to the Defence Minister requesting for an additional pontoon bridge over the Yamuna was released on social media, the former in his defence explained: \u201cEven if you go through the letter, I am not saying that the Army should work at the event. Just that since they were already constructing a bridge, I asked for more bridges (only) for the safety of the people.\u201d\n\nAfter the National Green Tribunal gave the green signal to the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar-led Art of Living (AOL) event, Mr. Mishra said they never had any objections to the event as it \u201cnever was an environmental disaster\u201d.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders will be attending the event on Friday. \u201cDelhi CM will be attending the event and it was decided well in-advance,\u201d confirmed sources in the Delhi government.\n\nWhile no plan has been chalked out to handle the traffic and accommodation, Mr. Kejriwal within hours after the NGT order tweeted: \u201cNow that NGT has given its verdict, all politics and controversies around AOL event shud be put to rest. It\u2019s a huge cultural event wherein people from 155 countries are coming. Delhi welcomes all guests [sic]\u201d",
