In an interview to a television channel, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar referred to the Army being involved in activities such as the Kumbh Mela, and said in this case \u201cit was done with the sole purpose of avoiding accidents\u201d.\n\nOfficials defended the decision saying that it was done in view of \u201cpublic interest\u201d as several lakh people were expected to attend. But this assertion found few takers with several serving officers questioning the logic of the Army being involved and some calling for drawing a distinction on the matter. \u201cIf this was an event of national pride, interest or significance, saving human lives and dignity, then yes, but if not, the military should not be the first agency,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Anil Chait, former Army Commander.\n\nAnother officer Lt. Gen. Thomas Mathew (retd) said, \u201cThe Army is being reduced to a contractor doing outsourced work.\u201dThe former Army Chief Gen. V.P. Malik, while observing that there was nothing illegal, wished that they did not do such things.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing illegal about it but when wartime equipment is employed for this kind of event, which is private, it should be the last resort,\u201d he told The Hindu .",
