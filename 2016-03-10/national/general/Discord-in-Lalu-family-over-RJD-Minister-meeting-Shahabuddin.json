The Opposition BJP and its allies demanded the Minister\u2019s resignation or dismissal from the Cabinet.\n\nOn Tuesday, when the photograph of the Minister along with another RJD MLA Harishankar Yadav meeting Mr. Shahabuddin in the Siwan jail, with snacks and other refreshments spread on a table went viral, Mr. Prasad said: \u201cWhat is wrong in it? ... it was a normal courtesy.\u201d The Minister himself declared the meeting a \u201ccourtesy call.\u201d Charged in over 20 criminal cases and convicted in five others, the former RJD MP has been in jail for more than a decade.\n\nMr. Prasad\u2019s wife Rabri Devi said: \u201cThe Minister is being targeted as he comes from the backward section, minority class \u2026 why don\u2019t BJP leaders make hullabaloo when forward caste criminals meet people in jail?\u201d Her younger son and Deputy CM, Tejaswi Yadav, said: \u201cIt is not an issue\u2026 even Priyanka Gandhi went to meet one of her father\u2019s killers in jail.\u201d\n\nBut, Tej Pratap Yadav, elder son of Mr. Prasad, was not amused. \u201cHe should not have gone to meet Shahabuddin. Even then, what was the need of getting photographed?\u201d he asked.",
