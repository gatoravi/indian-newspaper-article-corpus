    "text": "Despite sticking to its pre-2011 stand on fast tracking industrialisation, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front has taken a \u201ccautious\u201d approach to land acquisition in its draft manifesto for the West Bengal polls.\n\n\u201cLand acquisition for industry has to be dealt with carefully,\u201d states the manifesto. It emphasises on providing a \u201clucrative price\u201d and a job to one member from each of the families affected by land acquisition.\n\nThe draft manifesto states that \u201celaborate discussions\u201d have to take place between the State Government and the residents of the area where the land will be acquired. This assumes significance in the backdrop of the \u201cforced land acquisition\u201d at Singur for the Tata Motors\u2019 car factory that became the rallying point for the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led Opposition in the 2011 polls. The agitation played a key role in ending the 34-year-long Left Front rule in Bengal and brought the TMC to power.\n\nAs for employment generation, the manifesto says there will be \u201cgreater emphasis\u201d on boosting small and medium scale industries, but is guarded on large industries. It merely says \u201cthere should be effort also to set up large industries.\u201d\n\nSeeks feedback\n\nFor the first time, the Left Front has put its draft election manifesto on its website and has invited comments from the general public.",
