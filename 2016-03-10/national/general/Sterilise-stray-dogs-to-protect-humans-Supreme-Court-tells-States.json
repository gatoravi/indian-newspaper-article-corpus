Biju that safety of the human beings was jeopardised, yet authorities showed no inclination to combat the menace due to lack of funds or apathy.\n\n\u201cWe direct that dogs required to be sterilised or vaccinated, the procedure shall be carried out in accordance with the law and no organisation shall create any kind of obstacle or impediment in the same. It shall be the obligation of the Board to oversee that this is being carried out and no obstructions are created from any quarter,\u201d the Supreme Court said.\n\nIn a recent hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Kerala government whether measures could be taken to collect stray dogs in one place and sterilise them as per the law.",
