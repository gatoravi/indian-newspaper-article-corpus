    "text": "With no signs of an Interpol notice against Lalit Modi coming, India recently contacted the global police body and pressed its demand for an early notification of the Red warrant sought by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the former IPL Chairman in connection with its money laundering case.\n\nOfficial sources said on Wednesday that a meeting in this regard was recently held by a joint team of the ED, the CBI and the Ministry of External Affairs with the Interpol through video conferencing.\n\nThey said the Interpol, which raised a number of queries for notifying a Red Corner Notice (RCN) against Mr. Modi, was briefed about the ED\u2019s FIR in the case, the proceedings made in this regard in a special Mumbai court and the need for an urgent action on their part. Sources said the Interpol, at the conclusion of the meeting, assured the investigators that they would cooperate.\n\nThe ED had registered a money laundering case against Mr. Modi and others based on the Chennai police complaint in 2012.\n\nThe ED headquarters, sometime back, had also written to the Tamil Nadu police to expedite action in the FIR and brief it about its current status.\n\nWith no help coming on this front, the ED recently got a court\u2019s nod to begin extradition proceedings against Mr. Modi, whom it suspects to be based in the United Kingdom. The extradition request was granted by a special court in Mumbai sometime back and it had earlier issued a non-bailable warrant against Mr. Modi. \u2014 PTI",
