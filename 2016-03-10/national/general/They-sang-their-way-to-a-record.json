All the devotional songs were on Lord Anjaneya. The performance was organised by Dasa Sahitya Project of the Mantralayam mutt.\n\nThe artists came from New Delhi, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\nThe maximum number of singers, 996, was from Andhra Pradesh, followed by Karnataka (458) and Maharashtra (241). Most of the singers were women. Keyboard, mridangam, tabla and violin were used during the performance.\n\n\u201cWe are excited. We do not know Kannada. But we practised the Kannada songs with the help of the Devanagari script and performed well at the event,\u201d Anjali from Mumbai said.\n\n\u201814 years of practice\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have been practising Dasa Sahitya for the last 14 years. We are glad that our 40-year-old Bhajan Mandali is part of a world-record performance now,\u201d said Geetha, another participant.\n\nSingers from six States rendered devotional songs in Kannada at Mantralayam",
