    "text": "It has dwindled despite restriction on the use of diclofenac\n\nEven after a curb on the use of Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug acknowledged to have caused the decimation of vultures in the Indian subcontinent, the nests of vultures are dwindling in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), a safe habitat for different species of the birds in south India.\n\nThe Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had restricted human formulations of injectable Diclofenac to single, 3 ml dose packs last year to check its misuse by veterinary doctors. A preliminary survey on vulture population, organised by the Forest and Wildlife Department in four forest ranges under the WWS as part of the newly launched conservation programme, has pointed to a considerable decline in the number of nests.\n\nThough the survey recorded over 70 individual vultures, including 54 White-rumped ones and 19 Red-headed ones, it could sight only 11 nests, in three ranges of the sanctuary, P. Dhaneshkumar, Warden, WWS, said.\n\nWhile the largest number of nests was recorded at Kazhukan Kolly in Kurichyad forest range, no nest was found in Muthanga. No long-billed vulture was spotted during the survey, he said.\n\nHowever, close to 150 vultures of different species had been recorded by a camera trap in the Sulthan Bathery range while they were feeding on an elephant carcass nearly a month ago, P.A. Vinayan, a conservationistwho is part of the survey said.",
