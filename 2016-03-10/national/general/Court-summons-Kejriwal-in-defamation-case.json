I have no hesitation to hold that the allegations levelled by the respondents [Mr. Kejriwal and five others] are derogatory in nature and amount to slander and libel,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Dass said in his order.\n\nAlluding to the statements and the Facebook and Twitter posts by the accused, Mr. Dass said, \u201cThe statements have exposed the complainant [Mr. Jaitley] to ridicule, hatred and contempt among the right-thinking members of society and lowered his reputation.\u201d\n\nThe court also summoned AAP leaders Ashutosh, Kumar Vishwas, Raghav Chadha, Deepak Bajpai and Sanjay Singh after recording the statements of Mr. Jaitley and his other witnesses in support of the allegation of defamation.",
