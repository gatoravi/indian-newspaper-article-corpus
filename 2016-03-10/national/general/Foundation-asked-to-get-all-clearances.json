Governor, Delhi in December last year but filed the present application in the Green Tribunal only on February 8 this year.\n\nComing down heavily on the AoL, the Tribunal stated that it had not obtained any permission as yet from the Delhi Police, Fire Department, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. The AoL has been directed to obtain all required permissions. Justice Kumar noted that as per the documents on record \u201cthe flood plains have been drastically tampered with while destroying the natural flow of the river. Ramps, roads, compaction of earth, pontoon bridges and other semi-permanent or temporary structures have come up even without permission.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said: \u201cWe hereby direct the Principal Committee constituted under the judgement, to submit a report within four weeks from today, in relation to the steps required to be taken for restoration, restitution and rejuvenation of the flood plains to its original status. It will also state the approximate cost that would be incurred for such restoration and restitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nPetitioner Manoj Misra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan welcomed the order, stating that the direction clearly indicated that violations had taken place and that the court had viewed them seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is also a huge message to the government agencies and custodian of natural resources to ensure that they function properly. As for us appealing to the court late we accept it in all humility,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Misra.\n\nEnvironmental activist Anand Arya rued that over 1000 acres of mostly marshland had been stripped.\n\n\u201cThe flood plains have been tampered with and the flow of the river destroyed.\u201d",
