While doctors have confirmed the death of two, the third is said to be in a critical condition.\n\nThe leopardess, who herself is in a bad shape, has given up eating after she could not reconcile herself to her new surroundings at the Aurangabad zoo after being removed from her environs in Gadchiroli.\n\nRenu along with a leopard, \u2018Raja\u2019, were brought to the Siddharth zoo a fortnight back from Dr. Prakash Baba Amte\u2019s animal haven, \u2018Hemalkasa\u2019 situated deep in the dense forests of Bhamragad in the Naxal-affected Gadchiroli district.\n\nBoth animals were part of Dr. Amte\u2019s Animal Ark, the orphanage-cum-rescue centre dedicated to the protection of orphaned young of wild animals.\n\nWhile Raja was chosen to fill a vacancy for a leopard at the Siddharth Zoo, such was the bond between the pair that the authorities did not want to split the duo.\n\nAs a result, Renu too, was transported from her environs in Gadchiroli, making the arduous journey to the Aurangabad zoo.\n\nWhile Raja adapted himself to the new surroundings, Renu, without of the attention of Dr. Amte and his wife, Mandakini, failed to cope and her health progressively deteriorated.\n\nAs Renu gave up eating, doctors called up the Amte family for guidance.\n\nWith the condition of the third leopard cub critical and Renu in distress, the Siddharth zoo authorities are planning to bring in the Amte family to attend to the leopardess.\n\nLeopardess could not adapt to the surroundings after being shifted\n\nfrom Gadchiroli",
