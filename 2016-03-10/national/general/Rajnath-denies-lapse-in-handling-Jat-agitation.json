In a reply to supplementary questions, Mr. Singh said that an advisory was issued on February 19, after having shared intelligence inputs with the State government.\n\nMr. Singh said the State government was in talks with community leaders in a bid to find an amicable solution. However, violence broke out after an incident where three people lost their lives as the BSF had to resort to firing to control the situation.\n\nHe asked the members to wait for the report of the inquiry commission headed by the former Director-General of Police Prakash Singh to investigate the incidents during the stir.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that if needed, a judicial inquiry could be instituted.",
