India\u2019s workhorse satellite launch vehicle PSLV-C32 will carry the payload. As in the previous five launches of IRNSS satellites, PSLV-C32 will use the \u2018XL\u2019 version of PSLV, according to ISRO.\n\nThe ISRO had put into orbit the IRNSS-1E in January this year. The IRNSS-1F will be launched into a sub-Geosynchronous transfer orbit with a 284-km perigee (nearest point to Earth) and 20,657-km apogee (farthest point to Earth), according to ISRO.\n\nThe satellite will carry two types of payloads \u2014 navigation payload and ranging payload. The navigation payload will transmit navigation service signals to users while the other consists of a C-band transponder that facilitates accurate determination of the range of the satellite.\n\nThe IRNSS\u20141F is part of the space segment satellites of the IRNSS system. The space segment consists of seven satellites.",
