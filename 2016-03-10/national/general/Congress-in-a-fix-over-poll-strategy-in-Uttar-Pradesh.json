The senior leadership, however, is more inclined towards strengthening the campaign from the grassroots by sending Mr. Gandhi and a stable of its firebrand leaders to as many districts as possible.\n\nA senior Congress leader said there is also a talk of stitching up a Bihar-like alliance since it is hard for the Congress to cut through BSP leader Mayawati\u2019s clout among the Dalit population and is well aware about the support the ruling SP has among the OBC communities. In view of these odds, the idea of naming any leader as a chief ministerial candidate sounds \u201cillogical,\u201d he said.",
