    "text": "Fingertip will be connected to nerves\n\nA team of Swiss scientists has enabled an amputee feel smoothness and roughness in real-time with an artificial fingertip that was surgically connected to nerves in his upper arm.\n\nThe nerves of non-amputees were also stimulated to feel roughness, meaning that prosthetic touch for amputees can now be developed and safely tested on anyone, said the team from the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (EPFL).\n\n\u201cThe stimulation felt almost like what I would feel with my hand. I still feel my missing hand, it is always clenched in a fist. I felt the texture sensations at the tip of the index finger of my phantom hand,\u201d said amputee Dennis Aabo Sorensen.\n\nMr. Sorensen is the first person in the world to recognise texture using a bionic fingertip connected to electrodes that were surgically implanted above his stump.\n\nNerves in his arm were wired to an artificial fingertip equipped with sensors.\n\nAs the fingertip moved across textured plastic, the sensors generated an electrical signal. This signal was translated into a series of electrical spikes, imitating the language of the nervous system, then delivered to the nerves. \u2014 IANS",
