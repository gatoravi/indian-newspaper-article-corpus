The SPG has taken over the venue today, 48 hours in advance, which is part of its drill. This is an indication that PM Modi is likely to attend the event. We have not been conveyed anything from the PMO though,\u201d a senior official said.\n\n\u201cThere have been shortcomings in the arrangements and we have asked the organisers to reduce the number of people on stage. Say, if earlier five people were to be present on the stage at any given time, we have reduced that to three and have asked the organisers to follow the norms,\u201d the official said.\n\nA senior Urban Development Ministry official said that based on the CPWD\u2019s suggestions, the organisers were still \u201cimprovising the designs.\u201d",
