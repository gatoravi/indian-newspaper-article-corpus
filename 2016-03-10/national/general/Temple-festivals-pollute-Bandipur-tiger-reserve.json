    "text": "The Bandipur fire, which was suspected to be the handiwork of a few people visiting a local temple at Tavarekatte on Tuesday, brings the focus back on places of worship in tiger reserves, and the possible relocation of temples.\n\nThere are about six to eight such places of worship in Bandipur, besides 40 in Nagarahole. These are frequented by people from villages on the forest fringes. Though not all temples attract a huge crowd \u2014 people visit them only on a specific day in a year \u2014 there are a few that see frequent visitors.\n\nWildlife activists espousing temple relocation say festivals have been scaled up in recent years to include stage programmes and mass feeding, which entail the entry of a large number of vehicles and non-stop operation of diesel generator sets. These create noise and air pollution, disturbing wildlife. However, B.R. Praveen of Vanya \u2014 Let the Wild be Wild, an NGO advocating conservation, said a via media approach was ideal as relocation of temples at one go may not be practical. \u201cWhile the rituals by priests can be held at the temples, the carnival associated with them should be encouraged to take place in the local villages,\u201d he said.\n\nNaveen Kumar, Honorary Wildlife Warden, Chamarajanagar, said temple relocation should be a slow and long-drawn process. \u201cBut if there is total restriction, it could lead to a backlash,\u201d he said.\n\nOther activists said temple relocation should be encouraged wherever possible. They said that leftover food and carcass of animals sacrificed tend to attract wild animals that get habituated to cooked food.",
