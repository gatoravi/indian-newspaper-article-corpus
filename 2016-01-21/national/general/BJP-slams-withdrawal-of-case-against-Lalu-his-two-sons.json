Mr Modi also charged that the government buckled under pressure of \u201cSuper CM\u201d Lalu Prasad to withdraw the case against him, his two sons and over 200 party workers.\n\n\u201cWill the State government now withdraw cases against RJD leader and former party MP, Mohd. Shahabuddin, who is in jail, and several other RJD and JD(U) MPs and MLAs under pressure of Lalu Prasad?\u201d asked the BJP leader. Mr. Modi also hit out at the Chief Minister for \u201cbowing down to the RJD chief Lalu Prasad for the sake of being in power.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the chief judicial magistrate of the Patna civil court, Om Prakash, had accepted the plea of the government lawyer for withdrawal of the case against Mr. Prasad, his two sons Tejaswi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, State party chief Ram Chandra Purve and 262 party workers under Section 321 of Cr.PC. The charge sheet was filed on October 13 last year. However, out of 24 FIRs registered under various police stations against RJD supporters during the bandh call, only one involving Mr. Prasad and his two minister sons was withdrawn.\n\nThe case was filed against all of them last year on July 27 for vandalism and preventing government officials and stopping vehicles of at least three Patna High Court judges during the bandh call. The case was registered against them under various Sections of the IPC with the Kotwali police station following the directive of the then Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Vikas Vaibhav.\n\nThe Patna High Court would hear the matter on February 1.",
