    "text": "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) informed the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that it would build 13 night shelters to accommodate 500 homeless children.\n\nThe BMC in an affidavit said 33 locations had been identified, tenders were floated and NGOs have expressed interest in the project.\n\nThe court asked the BMC not to proceed with its present development plan as it does not provide sufficient space for night shelters. The court was also of the view that if policy permits, temporary structures could be built under flyovers, where homeless children could also be accommodated.\n\nA Division Bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice CV Bhadang was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Homeless Collective, an NGO.\n\nThe petition said that the existing shelters did not function properly and lacked basic facilities and infrastructure. The petition highlighted the 2011 Supreme Court ruling stipulating five shelter homes for five lakh people, following which the State government directed the BMC to build such shelters.\n\nIt was brought to the court\u2019s notice that Mumbai needed 207 night shelters, but only nine are operating as against the 25 promised in 2012.\n\nThe petition pointed out that the Centre bore 75 per cent of the cost incurred for operating and managing the night shelters and the State had to bear the rest.\n\nThe court directed senior counsel Gayatri Singh, appearing for the petitioner, and BMC officials, to conduct a joint survey of the feasibility of the locations identified and adjourned the matter till January 28.\n\nMumbai needs 207 night shelters, but only nine are functioning as against the 25 promised in 2012",
