But sources confirmed that they were in touch with a Syria-based member of Ansar-ut Tawhid fi Bilad al-Hind (AuT), which has pledged allegiance to the IS.\n\n\u201cThe suspects were tracked down with inputs from a central intelligence agency. They had planned attacks at Ardh Kumbh Mela, on trains bound for Haridwar, which is hosting the event, and at some strategic locations in the capital,\u201d Mr. Deep said.\n\nAkhlaq ur-Rehman, Mohammad Ajimussan, Mohammad Meraj alias Monu (all aged 20) and Osama Mohammed alias Adil (18) were in touch with a key member of AuT through social media and Voice over Internet Protocol.\n\nThey are residents of Manglour in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, and are pursuing undergraduate degrees.\n\n\u201cAn FIR was registered on the night of January 18.
