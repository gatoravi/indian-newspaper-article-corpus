Rahman and Gulzar, another person of Indian origin has joined the list of Academy Award winners. Rahul Thakkar, a computer engineering graduate from Mumbai University, has won an Oscar that honours scientific and technical achievement.\n\nMr. Thakkar shares the honour with Richard Chuang for \u201cgroundbreaking design\u201d of the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System.\n\nEarlier this month, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the ten scientific and technical achievements represented by 33 individuals who will be honoured at its annual scientific and technical awards presentation on February 13, at the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cWith their outstanding, innovative work, these technologists, engineers and inventors have further expanded filmmakers\u2019 creative opportunities on the big screen,\u201d said Richard Edlund, Academy Award-winning visual effects artist and chair of the Scientific and Technical Awards Committee.\n\nUnlike other Academy Awards, achievements receiving Scientific and Technical Awards need not have been developed and introduced during 2015. Rather, the achievements must demonstrate a proven record of contributing significant value to the process of making motion pictures.\n\nMr. Thakkar, who took his Master\u2019s degree in computer science from Utah State University has over 20 years of experience in product design and research and is presently the vice-president at Brivo Systems.\n\nThe Academy Award citation says of the DreamWorks media review system: \u201cOver its nearly two decades of development, this pioneering system enabled desktop and digital theater review. It continues to provide artist-driven, integrated, consistent and highly scalable studio-wide playback and interactive reviews.\u201d\n\nShares award with Richard Chuang for design of DreamWorks Media Review System",
