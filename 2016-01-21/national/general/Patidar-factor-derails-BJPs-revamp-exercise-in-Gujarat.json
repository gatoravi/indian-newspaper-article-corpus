    "text": "The Patidar factor in Gujarat continues to haunt BJP State unit\u2019s revamp exercise, causing a dilemma for party leaders over selection of new heads to guide the cadre for the next Assembly elections slated for December 2017.\n\nAs per the schedule, though State party president was supposed to be named by January 20, it appears that the new chief would be selected only after the elections for the party\u2019s national president.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to complete the process of revamp by January 20, but now it will be done after the process to elect a national president,\u201d a top BJP leader told The Hindu , blaming the \u201cPatidar factor\u201d for the postponement.\n\nHuge dilemma\n\n\u201cThere is a huge dilemma as to whether to appoint a new president from the Patel community or go for an OBC or a Kshatriya face. If we go for a Patel, obviously OBCs and other castes groups will be upset as both the Chief Minister and the State party head would be from the same caste,\u201d he said, explaining the tricky situation the party faces. \u201cIf we select someone from OBC or Kshatriya commuities, we will have to face the wrath of Patels, who are already upset with us and voted against the party in the local elections,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the party insiders, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel is apparently insisting on the name of Mansukh Mandavia, a Rajya Sabha member and general secretary of the State BJP, for the post.\n\nMr. Mandavia is a Patel from Saurashtra, but to what extent his appointment will placate the agitating Patels seems uncertain.",
