    "text": "A war of letters broke out between the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and Facebook over what the regulator called the social networking giant\u2019s \u201ccrude\u201d attempt at turning the consultation over differential pricing of data services into an \u201corchestrated opinion poll\u201d on its Free Basics product.\n\nThe social networking site hit back in a statement on Wednesday, stressing that the expression of support for Free Basics is \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the debate. Facebook said it \u201cattempted to cooperate\u201d with TRAI.\n\nIn a strongly worded communiqu\u00e9 uploaded on its website on Tuesday night, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) slammed Facebook\u2019s approach to the consultation on differential pricing of data services, the irrelevance of template submissions from millions of its users backing Free Basics and the nature of consent it had obtained from these users.\n\n\u201c\u2026Your urging has the flavour of reducing this meaningful consultative exercise designed to produce informed decisions in a transparent manner into a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll,\u201d wrote K.V. Sebastian, Joint Adviser at TRAI, in a January 18 letter to Ms. Ankhi Das, Director, Public Policy, Facebook.\n\n\u201cNeither the spirit nor the letter of a consultative process warrants such an interpretation which, if accepted, has dangerous ramifications for policy-making in India,\u201d Mr. Sebastian warned, terming \u201cwholly misplaced\u201d Facebook\u2019s continued assertion that initial template responses sent by users in support of \u2018digital equality\u2019 and \u2018Free Basics\u2019 were appropriate responses to the consultation paper.",
