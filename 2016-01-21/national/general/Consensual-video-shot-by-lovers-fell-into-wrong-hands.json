While Muslim families have started leaving, a section of the villagers was categorical in claiming that the Jat girl and Irshad were known to be lovers and their affair was at least four years old.\n\nBoth attended the same college in Khatauli where they became close and it was during this time that they shot the video. After minutes of random conversation, the villagers opened up and showed to this correspondent the intimate pictures and videos of the two lovers which had gone viral.\n\nLast week, the 25-year-old-Jat woman from Kalawda Kala went to the Khatauli police station accompanied by BJP and VHP leaders to register a case of gang rape and blackmailing against two Muslim men from the same village. Subsequent to the filing of the FIR, local BJP leaders invoked \u201crape love jihad\u201d by Muslim youths in the area and threatened dire consequences, including organising a \u201cMahapanchayat.\u201d In just over 24 hours, Irshad, the alleged rapist, and his cousin Nazar, were arrested.\n\n\u201cYou see the pictures and videos. None of the pictures and videos indicate any hint of coercion and rape and have been shot in hotels of Meerut,\u201d said Rajkunwar Saini, a member of the Saini community in the village.\n\nRajkunwar said the affair of Irshad and his Jat girlfriend was a known fact among their classmates in college.\n\n\u201cThe girl got married two years ago but the lovers were in touch. Due to this affair there was marital discord after which she filed for divorce. But people know that even after that both the lovers used to meet in Meerut,\u201d said a neighbour of Ashok, a mobile mechanic who is accused of copying the video from Irshad\u2019s phone and making it public.\n\nAccording to the youths in Kalawda Kala, everything was fine between the two till last week when Irshad\u2019s cousin Nazar gave the phone to a local mobile mechanic to download songs and movies.\n\n\u201cNazar wanted to download some songs in Irshad\u2019s phone. And that is when the phone shop guy copied the intimate videos from the memory card of his phone and later started selling them to locals at the rate of few rupees per video,\u201d said a former classmate of the lovers.\n\n\u201cWhen the video became viral, the girl\u2019s family registered a case of rape against Irshad. But the matter took a communal turn when BJP leaders made it a Hindu versus Muslim issue, which it is not, because the three accused are Hindus who own mobile phone shops in the village and who had allegedly copied the video and were selling it,\u201d said Rajkunwar.\n\nMuzaffarnagar village is tense and locals are scared of fresh communal violence",
