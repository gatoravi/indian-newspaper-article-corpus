We stand united with the people and the Government of Pakistan in their resolve to fight the menace of terrorism and condemn use of violence under any circumstances. Today\u2019s [Wednesday\u2019s] attack in Pakistan and the recent attack on an airbase in Pathankot are a grim reminder of how the terrorists are trying to destabilise the region,\u201d said Ms. Mufti. Hurriyat faction chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said: \u201cTerrorism in any form and at any place is condemnable.\u201d\n\n\u2018No place for terror\u2019\n\nStating that \u201cthere is no place for terror in Islam,\u201d he said the \u201cinternational community needs to take [a] united stand against terrorism and make combined efforts to curb this menace.\u201d\n\nJKLF chairperson Muhammad Yasin Malik termed the attack on students as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttacking educational institutions is inhuman and uncivilised. [The] first word of the first revelation to our beloved Prophet Muhammad was \u2018Read\u2019 and those who attack schools, colleges, universities and other institutions related to education are actually acting against Koran and trying to push our next generations towards darkness.\u201d",
