    "text": "With the BJP notified January 24 as the date for the filing and scrutiny of nominations for the post of party chief, Amit Shah seems all set to be elected for a full three-year term.\n\nThe saffron party\u2019s convention is that just one consensus candidate files the nomination and is elected unopposed.\n\nWhen Nitin Gadkari seemed set for a second term in 2013, there was a possibility of a contest, with Yashwant Sinha procuring nomination forms and the voters\u2019 list from the party\u2019s then election officer Thawarchand Gehlot. However, Mr. Gadkari, under pressure over allegations of irregularities in the Purti group, opted out of the race and Rajnath Singh emerged as the consensus candidate with the Sangh, till then backing Mr. Gadkari, agreeing to his name.\n\nMr. Shah became party chief midway through Mr. Singh\u2019s term as the latter joined the Cabinet. This would thus be Mr. Shah\u2019s first full term.\n\nHe is considered a close confidant of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though some party leaders, including veterans LK Advani and MM Joshi, have expressed disappointment over the recent Bihar poll results.\n\nMr. Shah\u2019s term saw remarkable victories for the BJP in states like Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand and the party sharing power in Jammu and Kashmir, but the rout in Delhi and Bihar was a dampener.\n\nThis year, the party has a winning chance only in Assam. Even the next year would be tough, with Punjab and UP being tough elections for the BJP.\n\nRSS agrees\n\nRSS leaders have met the BJP brass and are believed to have agreed to Mr. Shah as party chief, with some riders like being more consultative in his approach and accommodating leaders he may disagree with.",
