    "text": "\u201cI am disgusted with Hindus and Hinduism because I am convinced they cherish wrong ideals and live a wrong social life,\u201d a booklet recently brought out by some Hyderabad-based activists and academics of the Dalit movement to take on the Sangh Parivar quotes B.R. Ambedkar as saying.\n\nThe 87-page booklet, of which 1,000 copies have been printed, is a direct critique of RSS \u2018mouthpiece\u2019 Organiser \u2019s recent collector\u2019s edition to mark 125 years of the birth of India\u2019s first Law Minister.\n\nAmong the four authors, two \u2014 K. Laxminarayana and K.Y. Ratnam \u2014 teach at University of Hyderabad witnessing a storm after a Dalit research scholar ended his life after a standoff with the administration and the Sangh\u2019s student affiliate ABVP.\n\nThe booklet is titled \u2018Ambedkar can neither be adopted nor appropriated by the Hindutva elements.\u2019 It has serious issues with the Organiser \u2019s edition: its bid to see Dr. Ambedkar as a \u2018Hindu reformer\u2019 and the absence of references to substantiate the claims made.\n\nThe booklet mentions an article in the edition that refers to a purported visit by Dr. Ambedkar to an RSS camp and his \u201cappreciation\u201d for the \u201cabsence\u201d of caste feeling in the Sangh.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any reference to public sources, it is difficult to believe these statements of endorsement of the RSS by Dr. Ambedkar. In fact, the RSS is an organised institution to re-implement the caste order and all evils of Hinduism,\u201d says the booklet.\n\nAccording to it, Dr. Ambedkar saw \u201cconversion\u201d as important for Dalits just like self-government was for India. The booklet questions the reading of RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal \u2014 in an article on Dr. Ambedkar \u2014 that an event linked to the Arab invasion of Sindh in Raja Dahir\u2019s time was the first instance of untouchability in India.\n\n\u201cThis is a very mischievous and absurd statement,\u201d the authors say, referring to Mr. Gopal\u2019s apparent bid to link the practice of untouchability to the coming of Islam to India.\n\nIt repeatedly questions the authors of the Organiser articles \u2014 some of them Sangh functionaries \u2014 on the absence of references to many of the assertions made.\n\nIt decries the\n\nattempt to see\n\nB.R. Ambedkar\n\nas a \u2018Hindu reformer\u2019",
