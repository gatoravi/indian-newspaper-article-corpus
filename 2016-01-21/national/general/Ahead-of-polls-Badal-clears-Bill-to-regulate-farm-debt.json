    "text": "The Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government in Punjab, which faced the wrath of farmers a couple of months ago, has stepped up its efforts to win over farmers ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal cleared a Bill, to be introduced in the coming Assembly session, for reducing the debt of farmers.\n\n\u201cFarmers of the State who made the country self-reliant in food production by dint of hard work are consistently facing an economic distress owing to the ever-increasing debt,\u201d Mr. Badal said at a meeting held in Chandigarh. Lesser Minimum Support Prices and increasing input costs had squeezed their profits. The distress in agriculture forced farmers to end their lives. \u201cIt is the need of the hour to regulate money-lending so as to safeguard the interests of farmers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would go a long way in bringing much needed relief to the debt-ridden farmers on one hand and regulating the process of money lending on the other,\u201d he added.",
