According to highly placed sources in the Ministry, the decision was taken due to \u2018mounting pressure from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) to show results\u2019. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS), a large-scale household sample survey is the main source for detailed health statistics in India. The survey had last been conducted in 2005-06 and the public health community, globally, was surprised as a partial data set for 13 States, was released without a media briefing.\n\nA senior bureaucrat in the Ministry said on condition of anonymity that NFHS was released under pressure from the PMO to \u2018show results\u2019. \u201cThe secretaries had a meeting at the PMO on Sunday, and were asked to show results for the work being done. We had this data ready. There is a lot of pressure to show results,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe Statistics department had released the data without any consultation with senior bureaucrats in the Ministry. \u201cThe Department of Statistics uploaded the data without any consultation,\u201d said another senior official. A third official said, \u201cWe waited 11 years for the data. It makes no sense that they could not wait a few more months for all India data to be compiled.\u201d\n\nC.R.K. Nair. Additional Director-General, Statistics, said \u201cthe survey is not complete. For now we have only 13 States. The survey is just beginning in other States. We did not think there was any point in calling the media since we did not have the entire data set,\u201d he added. The complete data from NFHS-4 will be available by September. The data released on Tuesday has health indicators for Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Puducherry.",
