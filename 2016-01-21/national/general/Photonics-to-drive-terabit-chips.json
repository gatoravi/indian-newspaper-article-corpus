    "text": "Scientists from the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru are working on two projects in the area of photonic integrated circuits.\n\nIn the first, researchers and scientists at CeNSE are building a next-generation processor. It\u2019s hard to imagine a world without microprocessors. These ubiquitous little chips drive our technology and are embedded everywhere, from phones to laptops to DVDs and rockets. But at its very core, each unit is still electrical; it has millions of transistors connected with copper lines.\n\nWhat if you replaced the copper lines with photonic components? It would exponentially improve the power of microprocessors. Now, scientists from CeNSE, in a project supported by the Defence of Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), are trying to develop indigenous technology for high-speed optical interconnect technology. CeNSe has received a Rs. 5-crore grant from the DRDO for the three-year project.\n\n\u201cThe copper wires/interconnect create a bottleneck for data transfer, but the project, will exploit high-speed Silicon photonics to improve data transfer between the core and the memory exponentially,\u201d said Professor Shankar Kumar Selvaraja from CeNSe. In the second project, a CeNSE team is working towards improving the existing optical communication technology. \u201cThe aim is to build integrated photonic transceivers that will allow for communication speeds beyond 1 terabits per second per channel in a scalable fashion,\u201d said Professor V. R. Supradeepa, one of the principal investigators of this Rs. 3.40 crore project.",
