Till 2014-15, the ESIC had 2.03 crore insured people and covered 7.23 lakh factories across the country. Nearly 50 lakh workers in Delhi are beneficiaries under the scheme.\n\n\u201cWe had raised this issue in the past as well. The labour secretary also held various meetings with the State government officials. However, there hasn\u2019t been much progress so far. The Delhi government has been disbursing minimal sum of Rs. 50 crore or so towards ESIC in the past. The arrears have accumulated over the years,\u201d an ESIC board member said.\n\nThe ESI Act applies to factories with 10 or more workers, and employees drawing salary up to Rs. 15,000 per month are entitled to medical benefits.\n\nThe benefits covered under ESI Act include incidents of sickness, maternity, disability and death due to injury during work and other medical care benefits to insured persons and their families.\n\nAt present, all the State governments bear 1/8th share of expenditure on medical benefits provided under the ESIC Act and the rest is borne by the Centre. ESI Corporation is the custodian of the funds.\n\nThe ESI Scheme is financed by contribution from both employers and employees. At present, covered workers contribute 1.75 per cent of their wages and the employers contribute 4.75 per cent of the wages, payable to the worker, to the ESI corpus every month.\n\nThe ESIC scheme is implemented in all the States across the country except Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman and Nicobar Island.",
