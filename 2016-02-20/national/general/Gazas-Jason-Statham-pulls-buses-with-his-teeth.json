    "text": "Mohammed Baraka passion for pulling off daring feats have made him a local hero\n\nThe idea of pulling a 12-tonne bus seems a crazy one, and Mohammed Baraka takes a few minutes to prepare himself with his family and friends.\n\nOnly 20 years old, Mr. Baraka is far from a professional muscleman \u2014 in fact he is a second-year student in tourism and hotels at the Palestine Technical College in Deir Al Balah, his home town in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut he has become something of a local hero, with his feats posted on Facebook and shared widely among Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere.\n\nMr. Baraka now dreams of leaving the blockaded territory and becoming a global star.\n\nHis strength has earned him the nickname \u201cGaza\u2019s Samson\u201d, after the Biblical hero given supernatural force by God to fight his enemies and perform daring feats \u2014 including one where he ripped off the city gates of Gaza. But Baraka prefers to be called \u201cGaza\u2019s Jason\u201d after his favourite movie star, British action film hero Jason Statham. For his trick, Baraka uses his teeth while strapped into a harness to heave at a 20-person bus until it moves. Next he pulls a 50-seater bus.\n\nMr. Baraka is modest. \u201cI am very happy, as I managed to pull the big bus and brought joy to the children,\u201d he says. The young man dreams of travelling the globe to compete in international competitions. But in Gaza that is unlikely to happen any time soon.\n\nThe Palestinian enclave has been under a blockade by Israel since 2006, with severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods. \u2014 AFP\n\nI am very happy as I managed to pull the big bus and brought joy to the children",
