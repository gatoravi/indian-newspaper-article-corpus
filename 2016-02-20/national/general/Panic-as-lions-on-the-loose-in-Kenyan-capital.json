Avoid provoking the lions by confronting them,\u201d said KWS spokesman Paul Udoto.\n\nAt least two lionesses are reported to have late on Thursday left the park, spread over 117 square kilometres where buffalo and rhino roam just seven kilometres from the bustling high-rise city centre. Local media reported as many as six lions might be on the loose.\n\nIt is not the first time lions have prowled into town. The big cats are under growing pressure as one of Africa\u2019s fastest growing cities creeps onto ancient migration routes and hunting grounds.\n\nSometimes the lions are killed by livestock farmers protecting their herds, other times they prowl leafy gardens giving residents a fright.\n\n\u201cThese are highly populated areas and that is why we are intensifying the search,\u201d Mr. Udoto said, adding that \u201canyone with information about them should share it with us immediately.\u201d\n\nOne fearful Nairobi resident tweeted KWS spokesman Udoto asking whether she ought to \u201clock my kids in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please do until we report lions have been captured and safely returned to the park. Perils of born town lions,\u201d Mr. Udoto replied. \u2014 AFP",
