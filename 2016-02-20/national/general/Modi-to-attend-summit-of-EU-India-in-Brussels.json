    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to Brussels for the EU-India summit on March 30, which is being held after a long gap of four years that have also seen the suspension of talks on the Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), sources confirmed to The Hindu .\n\nOfficials say they hope that the visit by Mr. Modi, who will stop in Brussels on his way to the U.S. will also see an announcement on the resumption of talks on the BTIA, as the free trade agreement (FTA) is known.\n\nOn Monday Commerce Secretary Rita Teotia will lead a delegation to Brussels to meet her counterpart at the European Commission. Sources also say that there will be one more meeting on the FTA on March 30 at the level of Commerce Ministers on the sidelines of the PM\u2019s visit.\n\nAccording to officials there are still some obstacles preventing the resumption of the India-EU FTA talks that were suspended in 2013 after 16 rounds of negotiation.\n\nTo begin with, the EU is learnt to have asked India to substantially bring down the \u201chigh\u201d duties on automobiles as a pre-condition for resumption of the FTA negotiations. India\u2019s import duty on cars range from 60-120 per cent as against the EU\u2019s 10 per cent.",
