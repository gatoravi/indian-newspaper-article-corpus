But the press release from Pakistan indicated that the police had filed the case against the terror group, though an official confirmation is expected.\n\nThe filing of the case under the Anti Terrorism Act has been interpreted by observers as a sign that the \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d given by India to Pakistan after the attack has begun to produce results.\n\n\u201cFor some time we believed the leads provided by India were insufficient, but the application of the strict anti-terror law proves Pakistan has been able to move ahead on the leads it received from India or perhaps discovered on its own,\u201d the former Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Ashraf Jahangir Qazi, told The Hindu .\n\nThe announcement came amid growing expectations that the Foreign Secretary-level talks, which were postponed after the attack, will be held soon.\n\nWhile both sides maintained that the officials concerned were in touch with each other and a date would be announced soon, Pakistan on Thursday said it was in favour of not making the attack into an issue during the talks, which should be held \u201cas early as possible.\u201d\n\nVeteran diplomats in India have also called the filing of the case a positive step.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , veteran diplomat K.C. Singh said Pakistani action was the \u201cfirst positive step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWar of words\n\nReacting to a comment by Pakistan on a number of issues, including the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the ongoing student protests at the JNU, the government said that the developments in Jammu and Kashmir were \u201cinternal\u201d to India. \u201cPakistan\u2019s gratuitous references to Jammu and Kashmir are unacceptable\u201d, said Vikas Swarup, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs.",
