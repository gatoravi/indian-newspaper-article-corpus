    "text": "Hours before the President's rule was withdrawn in Arunachal Pradesh, the Supreme Court refused a suggestion by the State's Congress party leaders to order a floor test to be conducted in the Arunachal Assembly.\n\nThe apex court\u2019s decision to lift its order of status quo in the border State had cleared the road for withdrawal of the emergency and the possible consequence of a new government being formed with dissident Congress leader Kalikho Pul as Chief Minister.\n\nMr. Pul has already staked his claim to form the government with a majority backing of 32 MLAs in the Assembly. The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to intervene in Gauhati High Court's interim stay on the disqualification of the 14 rebel Congress MLAs who tilted the balance against the ruling Nabam Tuki government, triggering political crisis which led to the proclamation of emergency on January 26.\n\nPushing for an order for floor test, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said all the apprehensions of the Congress in Arunachal were coming true.\n\nBut the Bench refused, saying that though a floor test may be a \u201cpossible manner of dealing with the issue,\u201d it could not be done now as the Supreme Court was still hearing the case.\n\nMr. Sibal raised another apprehension, asking what would happen if the Centre and Governor J.P. Rajkhowa swore in a new Chief Minister, but later goes on to dissolve the House to ensure that power remains in their hand till snap polls were held.\n\nThe court however declined this request.",
