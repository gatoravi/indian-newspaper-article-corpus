    "text": "Jadavpur University will not file any police complaint against the students who shouted pro-Afzal Guru and other controversial slogans on the University premises earlier this week, Vice-Chancellor Suranjan Das said here on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is not in Jadavpur\u2019s tradition to file FIR against students.\u201d Prof. Das told journalists after meeting with West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, who is also Chancellor of all State Universities, including JU.\n\nAsked whether the Governor had asked him to file a police complaint, the Vice-Chancellor said he would not comment. The V-C said the Governor had asked for a report, which he would submit.\n\nProf. Das said the elected students\u2019 union representative of the University had assured him that the students did not support such slogans. According to the V-C, the slogans were raised by \u201cfringe elements.\u201d \u201cJust because a group of fringe elements did that, the entire JU community should not be blamed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe university has been tense over the past few days after pro-Afzal slogans and slogans demanding freedom for Kashmir and Manipur were raised on the campus.\n\nThis was followed by a group of students storming the University and tearing posters. On Thursday, a near confrontation between the supporters of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidharthi Parishad and the Left students\u2019 organisation was averted on the faculty\u2019s intervention.",
