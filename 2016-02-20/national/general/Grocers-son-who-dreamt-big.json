    "text": "Ringing Bell Private Limited has attracted the attention of the entire world for offering what, at Rs. 251, must be the cheapest smart phone. What has escaped the attention of most people in all the excitement that the news generated is the largely humble background of the company\u2019s founder Mohit Goel.\n\nMr. Goel used to sit in his father\u2019s small grocery shop in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh till a few years ago. The grocery shop in Garhipukhta area has also become the topic of discussion in Shamli since the advertisements about what is now popularly called the \u201cFreedom 251\u201d phone began to come out.\n\n\u201cThe phone was launched on Thursday at a very big function in Delhi. Frankly, I did not for a moment think that the mobile company, which Mohit told us about few months ago, would be so big,\u201d the proud father Rajesh Goel told The Hindu on the phone from Shamli.\n\n\u201cHe is very grounded and hardworking. When I realised the importance of the phone he has come up with, I was not surprised because he is very passionate about what he does.\u201d He called his son\u2019s success story one of the most \u201cremarkable\u201d in recent history in a region that is generally in the news for communal riots and crime.\n\nThe proud father said that he himself gave some money to his son for his startup.\n\n\u201cHe used to tell us that he wanted to start his own company around the idea of an affordable smart phone. In order to encourage him, I gave him some money and now I am also the director of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to IIT to come up with innovative ideas.\u201d Mr. Mohit, he said, did his engineering from Amity in Noida.",
