They are also immune to viruses.\n\nThose that pass the tests must meet a final criterion \u2014 they must be able not only to grow well on Mars but also reproduce in large quantities. \u201cWe\u2019re almost 100 per cent certain that many of the selected potatoes will past the tests,\u201d said Julio Valdivia Silva, a Peruvian NASA astrobiologist who is taking part in the ambitious project.\n\nThe scientists hope the experiment will also help address the earthly scourges of hunger and malnutrition by identifying varieties suited to growing in harsh conditions.\n\n\u201cWe must be prepared for the future,\u201d said virologist Jan Kreuze, a scientist at CIP. \u201cTo respond to desertification, rising temperature and high salt content in the soil.\u201d\n\nVegetable of the future\n\nThe soil in La Joya Pampas \u2014 a sector of the Atacama Desert in southern Peru that\u2019s considered one of the driest places on earth \u2014 is very similar to that found on the Red Planet.\n\nThe scientists plan to transport 200 pounds (100 kilos) of it to a CIP laboratory in Lima that will simulate the complex Martian atmosphere \u2014which contains mostly carbon dioxide \u2014 and expose it to extreme ultraviolet radiation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have more concrete results in one or two years, Mr. Valdivia said, adding that it will take more than five years to launch an unmanned mission to Mars.\n\nThe potential future space crop is also one of the oldest.\n\nRecords of potato cultivation date back to 2500 BC, when the indigenous Aymara Indians farmed it in modern-day Peru and Bolivia.\n\nIf the varieties selected for next month\u2019s experiment don\u2019t adapt to the desert soil, the researchers will introduce nutrients and subject them to radiation.\n\n\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Valdivia said, \u201cwe\u2019ll administer a new method the CIP is using called aeroponics.\u201d The technique, used for cultivating plants without soil, would expose roots inside a sphere or cube that is sprayed with nutrients and contains a system for removing toxins. In future years, NASA plans to build a Mars research centre in the Peruvian desert.\n\nIt would create a perfect replica of the Martian landscape and atmosphere for future research into space farming that could serve manned missions to Mars and other planets in the solar system. \u2014 AFP",
