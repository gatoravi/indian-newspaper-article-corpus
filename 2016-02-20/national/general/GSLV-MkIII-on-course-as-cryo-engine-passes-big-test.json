This is the time the cryogenic stage will be in action during an actual GSLV-MkIII flight.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s cryogenic engine test for the MkIII was successful,\u201d said ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar, who witnessed the critical event along with senior officials involved in rocket development activities. \u201cIt gives us the confidence to go ahead [with its other activities] and more or less confirm a full launch of GSLV MkIII in December.\u201d Tested once in mid-2015 for 800 seconds, the engine prototype, he said, has proven that it can repeat the performance equally on a second or different hardware. Its design would be frozen, replicated for use in the cryogenic third stage of upcoming MkIII rockets. When it gets regularised in the coming years, the GSLV-MkIII launcher (some call it the LVM3) will be able to lift four-tonne communication satellites into their specified orbit. That is twice heavier than what the present indigenous GSLV-MkII can do.\n\nStage test next\n\nCalling it \u201c100 per cent success,\u201d S. Sivan, Director of the rocket-related hub, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, said, \u201cThere is confidence that we are going in the right direction\u201d with the cryoengine design. In a couple of months, they would test the entire cryogenic third stage, called C-25, with fuel tank, plumbing and other systems.",
