He said he had opposed the conducting the 10-day bonanza of Commonwealth games at a huge initial cost of Rs. 6,000 crore which finally went up to Rs. 60,000 crore.\n\nMr. Aiyer was addressing students of the Woxsen School of Business (WSB) located at Kankole village in Munipally mandal on Friday while participating in a panel discussion on \u2018Re-imagining leadership- a dialogue with leaders who matter.\u2019 Being true to oneself might not be always appreciated by one\u2019s immediate bosses, he said, adding that being true to oneself was more important than being successful in the eye of others. Anurag Batra, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief, Business World, was another panel member while Paromita Chatterjee, Senior Editor, ET Now, was moderator.\n\n\u201cBasic qualities remain same for becoming a successful leader. The options will be between doing right thing or being successful in the eye of others. Choose your own role model and for me Jawaharlal Nehru was role model from childhood,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Anurga Batra said that he had many failed businesses before becoming success and every failure would be an experience and stepping stone to success.",
