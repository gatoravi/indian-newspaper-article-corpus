    "text": "As President\u2019s Rule was revoked in Arunachal Pradesh on Friday evening, both factions of the Congress, one headed by dissident leader Kalikho Pul, and the other led by former Chief Minister Nabam Tuki, staked their claim to form a new government in the State.\n\nThe dissident Congress leaders told The Hindu that they were making arrangements for the swearing-in ceremony of their leader Kalikho Pul. \u201cWe have 32 MLAs with us, including 11 MLAs of the BJP, and have the requisite numbers to form the government\u201d, said one of the rebels. Mr.Tuki, whose authority was challenged by the party rebels, however, ruled out the formation of any new government without his approval. He said that according to law, with the revocation of President\u2019s Rule, power would be restored to him and the previous government led by him would assume charge.\n\nThe rebels, however, disputed Mr.Tuki\u2019s contention. \u201cEverything is in our hands\u201d, said Chowna Mein, a dissident, who has served as the State\u2019s Veterinary Minister in the past. \u201cThe entire Council of Ministers will be new. Pul will be sworn in tomorrow for sure, but we don\u2019t know whether he would like to pick his Council of Ministers on the same day.\u201d\n\nOn Mr.Tuki\u2019s claim that the dissidents lacked the numbers, Mr.Mein said that the Gauhati High Court had stayed the disqualification of the 14 MLAs, so they could extend support to the new government.",
