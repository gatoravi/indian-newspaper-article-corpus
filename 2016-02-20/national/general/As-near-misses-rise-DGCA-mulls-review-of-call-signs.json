    "text": "Incidents of mid-air near misses between airplanes have prompted the Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) to review the call signs given by air traffic controllers to all airlines in order to prevent confusion.\n\nA call sign refers to airline code and the number allotted to a particular flight.\n\nA committee headed by DGCA\u2019s joint director general Lalit Gupta has been formed which will have representatives from Airports Authority of India, domestic airlines and the Delhi airport.\n\nThe move was triggered by an incident in 2014 when two aircraft of different foreign airlines came close to each other in the Kolkata airspace due to similar call signs. The incident occurred due to similar sounding call signs of two flights on the same airport.\n\n\u201cThe air traffic controller would give clearance to one airline and due to similar call signs, it could be mistaken as clearance given to another airline which is a serious matter,\u201d a DGCA official said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee will review all the relevant regulations, international best practices and suggest measures for safety of aircraft operations,\u201d said a letter written by Director General of Civil Aviation chief M. Sathiyavathy. The committee is mandated to submit its report by end of March.",
