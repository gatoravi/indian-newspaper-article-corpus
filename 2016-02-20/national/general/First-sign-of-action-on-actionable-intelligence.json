Singh said Pakistani action was the \u201cfirst positive step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWar of words\n\nReacting to a comment by Pakistan on a number of issues, including the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the ongoing student protests at the JNU, the government said that the developments in Jammu and Kashmir were \u201cinternal\u201d to India. \u201cPakistan\u2019s gratuitous references to Jammu and Kashmir are unacceptable\u201d, said Vikas Swarup, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs.",
