The third engine identified for flight use will be vacuum tested in the high altitude test facility as part of the flight acceptance test.\n\nISRO chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar termed the test as a phenomenal achievement in the shortest time.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Kumar said preparations were under way for the first developmental flight of the GSLV Mark 3 in December 2016. He was talking to the media on the sidelines of a workshop organised by the VSSC and the Society for Aerospace Quality and Reliability (SAQR). The biggest rocket made in India, the Mk3 will be capable of launching four-tonne satellites into geosynchronous orbit.",
