Vermicomposting is the process of recycling organic matter into nutrient-rich compost using worms.\n\nIt is an important source in supplementing and substituting chemical fertilisers in agriculture.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, the zoo came up with the project of generating vermicompost after it realised the that the waste generated on its zoo premises was making the conditions unhygienic.\n\nBesides helping to improve hygiene on the zoo premises, the project has brought in additional revenue to one of the country\u2019s oldest and most prestigious zoological gardens.\n\nHow it does it\n\nOver a decade ago, Mysuru zoo was selling the waste from over 1,000 animals at throwaway prices. A lot of the waste lying in the zoo premises was unutilised\n\nDung from herbivores such as elephants, rhinos, hippos and gaur is a major source of vermicompost\n\nFallen leaves, grass and other green material from the garden section; and vegetable, kitchen and garbage waste are the other sources\n\nBlack-coloured, granular, lightweight and humus-rich compost is produced in 30 days after processing large volumes of organic residuals using earthworms",
