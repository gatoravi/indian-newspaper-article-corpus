    "text": "Two days after a video of two suspected thieves being stripped and assaulted at a railway station went viral, the Government Railway Police on Friday traced and arrested the two men seen perpetrating the assault in the video shot in 2013. A 42-member team of the Dadar GRP worked round the clock for five days, going through CCTV footage, talking to commuters and gaining clues from professional rivalry among fishermen to trace the accused.\n\nThe video, which emerged earlier this week, reached senior GRP officers, who instructed all police stations to look into the matter. GRP officials said the case was challenging for several reasons. \u201cIt was a blind case as all three crucial pillars of an FIR \u2014 time, place and victim\u2019s identity \u2014 were missing,\u201d said Railway Commissioner of Police Madhukar Pandey.",
