    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday maintained equanimity as a lawyer loudly protested inside the courtroom when parts of a petition alleged that the mob violence in the Patiala House courts in connection with the hearing of a sedition case against JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar was \u201cinstigated by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and other extremist organisations.\u201d\n\nA Bench of Justices J. Chelameswar and A.M. Sapre did not lose their poise as R.P. Luthra, a Supreme Court advocate, interrupted the court with an emotional outpouring that \u201che was pained by the portrayal of the RSS as an extremist organisation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe RSS has taught me that all women are my mother and sisters... I am hurt, pained,\u201d Mr. Luthra submitted. He said remarks about the RSS should be expunged from the petition.\n\nThe Bench stopped Mr. Luthra, saying \u201cthe court is not a stage for political speeches.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in who created or designed this... ,\u201d Justice Chelameswar said.",
