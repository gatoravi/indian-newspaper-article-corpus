    "text": "An often deadly and difficult to treat bacterial disease is much more prevalent than previously thought and kills tens of thousands of people worldwide each year, researchers said on Monday.\n\nMelioidosis, also known as Whitmore\u2019s disease, has long been known to be endemic in parts of South and East Asia, the Pacific and northern Australia.\n\nBut a new analysis by a team of international researchers suggests the disease is also present across swathes of South America and sub-Saharan Africa and likely present in parts of Central America, southern Africa and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cOur estimates suggest that melioidosis is severely under-reported in the 45 countries in which it is known to be endemic and that melioidosis is probably endemic in a further 34 countries that have never reported the disease,\u201d researchers led by Oxford University, the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Bangkok and the University of Washington in Seattle, wrote in a report.\n\nIt was published on Monday in Nature Microbiology.\n\nIt is the first time scientists have attempted to map the disease\u2019s global spread using computer modelling based on data from known outbreaks going back to 1910.\n\nThe disease, which often affects those working in fields, is notoriously difficult to diagnose because it mimics many other bacterial infections but only responds to a handful of antibiotics. As a result, misdiagnosis is common.\n\nThe mortality rate of 70 per cent is shockingly high, greater even than the H5N1 bird flu. Researchers estimated that as many as 89,000 people out of the the 165,000 people who caught melioidosis in 2015 died from the disease. \u2014 AFP",
