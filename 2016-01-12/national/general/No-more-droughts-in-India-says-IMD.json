Beginning this season, for instance, if India\u2019s monsoon rainfall were to dip below 10 per cent of the normal and span between 20 and 40 per cent of the country\u2019s area, it would be called a \u201cdeficient\u201d year instead of an \u201cAll India Drought Year\u201d as the IMD\u2019s older manuals would say. A more severe instance, where the deficit exceeds 40 per cent and would have been called an \u201cAll India Severe Drought Year,\u201d will now be a \u201cLarge Deficient Year\u201d.\n\nThe IMD has never used the term \u201cdrought\u201d in its forecasts and has maintained that declaring droughts was the prerogative of States. \u201cSome confusion has been there over some years,\u201d said B.P. Yadav, spokesperson for the agency, \u201cand we wanted to be more precise.\u201d\n\nThe agency had several definitions of drought: meteorological, hydrological and agricultural, and it was quite possible for a State to have a meteorological drought \u2014 90 per cent shortfall of the average monsoon rainfall \u2014 but not suffer an agricultural drought \u2014if the shortfall didn\u2019t affect more than 20 per cent of the State\u2019s area. \u201cDeclaring a drought has never been the IMD\u2019s mandate and, in fact, not even that of the Central government,\u201d said Shailesh Nayak, former Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, to whom the IMD reports. \u201cThat\u2019s because drought is not a measure of productivity (agricultural).\u201d\n\nOfficials said the change in the nomenclature would not practically influence the way States viewed droughts.\n\nThe spokesperson for the agency said there would now be a standardised definition for heat waves and cold waves, and the IMD\u2019s local arms would no longer use terms such as \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d to suggest the possibility of showers.",
