    "text": "In a context of improving relations between the two countries, China-India Dialogue , the first ever India-centric publication in China, is seeking to put renewed focus on issues common between and related to India and China. The idea is to provide a platform for Chinese and Indian commentators to write on politics and economy, and for academics from both countries to communicate and debate with each other on specific themes.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu here, Wen Zhihong, Editorial Director of the monthly, said China-India Dialogue , brought out by the China International Publishing Group (CIPG) based in Beijing, will focus on a monthly theme. The inaugural issue took up Internet connectivity in an inclusive economy as the theme. The next issue would focus on \u201cpoverty relief\u201d.\n\nChina-India Dialogue would attempt to expand its readership and presence in India, looking for both contributors and partners, and eventually to register as a publication in the country. It also had a website in the works, and would have other multimedia content hosted on it, she said.\n\nMs. Wen and her colleagues visited The Hindu \u2019s headquarters in Chennai and gave an overview of the magazine\u2019s plans to the editorial team of The Hindu group of publications. Their visit to India was to interact with media representatives and think-tanks and was arranged by the Chinese embassy.\n\nThe CIPG also publishes periodicals including China Pictorial , which comes out in Chinese, English, Russian and Korean.",
