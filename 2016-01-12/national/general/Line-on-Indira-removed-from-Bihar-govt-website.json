    "text": "After protests from the Congress party, the Bihar government\u2019s official website on Monday removed lines which referred to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\u2019s regime as \u201cworse than the British rule\u201d. The Congress is a coalition partner in the ruling alliance with the JD(U) and RJD and the party leaders objected strongly to the content in the government\u2019s official website under \u201cHistory of Bihar\u201d section.\n\nThe paragraph on the website read: \u201cIt was he (Jayaprakash Narayan) who steadfastly and staunchly opposed the autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nFearing people\u2019s reaction to his opposition, Indira Gandhi had him arrested on the eve of declaring National Emergency beginning June 26, 1975. He was put in the Tihar Jail, located near Delhi, where notorious criminals are jailed. Thus, in Free India, this septuagenarian, who had fought for India\u2019s freedom alongside Indira Gandhi\u2019s father, Jawahar Lal Nehru, received a treatment that was worse than what the British had meted out to Gandhiji in Champaran in 1917, for his speaking out against oppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reference to our party leader Indira Gandhi in a government\u2019s official website was unacceptable and we informed our top party leaders to take up the issue with Nitish Kumar,\u201d said State Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra.",
