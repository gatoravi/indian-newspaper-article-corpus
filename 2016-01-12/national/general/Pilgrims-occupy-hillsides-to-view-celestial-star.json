    "text": "Thousands of pilgrims have begun converging at various vantage points in the Sabarimala forests to worship the Makaravilakku deeparadhana and the celestial star, Makarajyoti, on January 15. The pilgrims are camping in makeshift tents on the hillsides in the forest area.\n\nThe ceremonial procession carrying the Thiruvabharanam, sacred ornaments of the deity, will set off from Pandalam on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board officials will escort the procession, as the royal representative of the Pandalam Palace would not lead the procession this time following the death of a senior member of the palace a few days ago.\n\nA 22-member team of devotees led by the Guruswami, Kulathinal Gangadharan Pillai, will carry the sacred jewellery in wooden boxes.\n\nThe procession will reach Sabarimala on January 15 afternoon.",
