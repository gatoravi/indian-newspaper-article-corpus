    "text": "David Bowie, the innovative and iconic singer whose illustrious career lasted five decades with hits like Fame , Heroes and Let\u2019s Dance , died on Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 69.\n\nRepresentative Steve Martin said early on Monday Bowie died \u201cpeacefully\u201d and was surrounded by family. The singer had battled cancer for 18 months.\n\n\u201cWhile many of you will share in this loss, we ask that you respect the family\u2019s privacy during their time of grief,\u201d the statement read. No more details were provided.\n\nBowie turned 69 on Friday, the same day he released a new album called Blackstar .\n\nBowie, who was born David Jones, came of age in the glam rock era of the early 1970s. He had a striking androgynous look in his early days and was known for changing his looks and sounds. The stuttering rock sound of Changes gave way to the disco soul of Young Americans , co-written with John Lennon, to a collaboration with Brian Eno in Berlin that produced Heroes .\n\n\u201cMy entire career, I\u2019ve only really worked with the same subject matter,\u201d Bowie said in 2002. \u201cThe trousers may change, but the actual words and subjects I\u2019ve always chosen to write with are things to do with isolation, abandonment, fear and anxiety all of the high points of one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most proud of is that I can\u2019t help but notice that I\u2019ve affected the vocabulary of pop music. For me, frankly, as an artist, that\u2019s the most satisfying thing for the ego,\u201d he said.\n\nBowie kept a low profile in recent years after reportedly suffering a heart attack in the 2000s. He made a moody album three years ago called The Next Day his first recording in a decade. Blackstar , which earned positive reviews from critics, represented yet another stylistic shift, as he gathered jazz players to join him. Bowie was married to international supermodel Iman since 1992. British PM David Cameron tweeted that Bowie\u2019s death is \u201ca huge loss.\u201d \u2014 AP\n\nBorn David Jones, the crooner came of age in the glam rock era of the early 1970s",
