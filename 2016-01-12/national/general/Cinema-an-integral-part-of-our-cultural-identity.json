Hamid Ansari at Thekkumthala, 27 km from Kottayam, on Monday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Ansari said cinema had become an integral part of the nation\u2019s cultural identity. While it was a form of popular entertainment, it had also emerged as a mass communication medium, which could transmit political and social messages.\n\nWhile it was true that a large number of films were made for entertainment, meaningful and artistic films continued to hold a special place in the hearts of the audience. Visual media was, therefore, attractive to youngsters today \u2014 both as an avenue of creative expression and as a career choice.\n\n\u201cThe medium of cinema undergoes a fundamental change whenever there is a new discovery in technology. Silent movies became talkies; black and white films became colour; celluloid film gave way to digital format. In this scenario, new aspirants need to learn not only the basics of the art and craft but also how to adapt with and adopt the latest technology,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor P. Sathasivam said the institute would fulfil the unbridled enthusiasm of the young to conquer new frontiers.\n\nChief Minister Oommen Chandy said the government was working towards declaring the autonomous institution a deemed university in the near future. Plans were afoot to establish a film hub connecting picturesque spots such as Munnar, Wagamon, Kuttikkanam and Kumarakom, with the institute acting as the nodal point.",
