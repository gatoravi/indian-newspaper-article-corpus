Ramakrishna\n\nCrimes against children was an indication of the abysmal depths to which society is falling, the Supreme Court said on Monday.\n\nRape of infants and children below 10 years was nothing but brutal perversion. It asked Parliament to enact a separate law providing for harsh punishment.\n\nThis is the first time the Supreme Court has distinguished infants and children below 10 from the general description of \u201cminors\u201d given by law to anyone below the age of 18.\n\nA Bench, led by Justice Dipak Misra, said Parliament had to separately define the word \u201cchild\u201d in terms of rape.\n\nThe suggestions to Parliament are part of an order dictated at the end of a hearing of a writ petition seeking castration as an additional punishment for child rapists.\n\n\u201cThe pain and distress caused to a child who knows nothing about sex and rape is nothing but brutal perversion. When a society moves this way, it has to be stopped,\u201d Justice Misra observed.\n\n\u201cVictims are as young as three years to four years of age... there was even one instance of a 28-day-old infant...\u201d Justice Misra remarked later that such crimes were \u201catrocious, unconscionable and cruel.\u201d\n\nThe court pointed out how Section 376 (2) (f) of the Indian Penal Code only talked of rape of a \u201cwoman below 12 years of age.\u201d The Code had no specific provision dealing with punishment for raping a girl below 10 and infants.\n\nAttorney-General Mukul Rohatgi agreed to highlight the court\u2019s suggestions to the government for putting it up before the lawmakers for an appropriate legislation.\n\nThe court, however, declined SCWLA\u2019s plea to include castration as an additional punishment, saying the judiciary could not issue a mandamus to create a punishment for an offence. \u201cThat is the job of the legislature,\u201d Justice Misra told senior advocate Mahalakshmi Pavani for SCWLA.\n\n\u201cYou have protected juvenile offenders in the past, it is time to protect juvenile victims,\u201d Ms. Pavani said.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion to Parliament comes even as new anti-rape laws have made rape punishable with death penalty.",
