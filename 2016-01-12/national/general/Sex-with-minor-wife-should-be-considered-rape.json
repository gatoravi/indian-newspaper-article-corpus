    "text": "The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the government\u2019s response on a PIL petition challenging a provision in the penal law, which does not consider sexual intercourse of a man with his minor wife as rape.\n\nA Bench of Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath agreed to examine the issue, which it had disposed of in July 2015, after the government told the court that the ground raised in this case was different from the plea pending before the Supreme Court. The court asked the Centre to file its reply to the review plea before March 23.\n\nThe Centre had earlier informed the court that the NGO\u2019s plea highlighting the exception in Section 375 of the IPC, which states that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, who is not under 15 years of age, is not rape, was pending for consideration before the Supreme Court. \u2014 PTI",
