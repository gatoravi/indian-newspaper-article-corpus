    "text": "The BJP is in the midst of heavy seat-sharing negotiations with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) for the Assembly polls in Assam, when the former Chief Minister and AGP leader, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, held a surprise meeting with senior BJP leader L.K. Advani.\n\nTop sources said the meeting took place on Friday evening but refused to confirm the reason, dismissing it as a courtesy call. Party sources said most of the negotiations were being conducted between party president Amit Shah and AGP leader Atul Bora.\n\n\u201cThe AGP is demanding at least 30-35 seats, and since the BJP has already sewn up an alliance with the Bodo People\u2019s Front (BPF), which has 12 MLAs now and has demanded around 30 seats, the negotiations have hit a rut,\u201d a senior office-bearer of the BJP said.",
