    "text": "The new recipe \u2014 a limited selection of dishes \u2014 is tailored to reducing waste and encouraging chefs\n\nIn the name of reducing waste and freeing up chefs\u2019 creativity, top British restaurants are doing away with long menus to give diners a limited selection of dishes or no choice at all.\n\n\u201cIt is we who decide,\u201d said Mikael Jonsson, head chef at Hedone in the district of Chiswick in west London.\n\nLast summer, the 49-year-old Swede decided to scrap the menu, after four years of observing customers\u2019 tastes.\n\n\u201cMore and more regular customers do not want to see the menu, and want a personalised menu drawn up by me,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said in his restaurant dining room.\n\nHedone has had a Michelin star since 2012, a year after it opened, and has been included in the world rankings of the \u201850 Best Restaurants\u2019 since 2013.\n\n\u201cSome wanted the surprise, others did not know what to order,\u201d he added.\n\nNow, Mr. Jonsson decides what diners will eat, though customers are asked about their preferences when they make a booking.\n\nFrom a personal point of view, \u201cit\u2019s super interesting to work this way\u201d, Mr. Jonsson said. \u201cNo two days are the same.\u201d\n\nMr. Jonsson uses ingredients available on the day to create a menu of seven to 10 dishes each evening, something which allows the use of higher quality and rarer ingredients.\n\n\u201cIf we offer bass on a menu which is changed every two months, it is impossible to offer exceptional bass every day. Now, if I can\u2019t find a bass I\u2019m happy with I will offer turbot or another fish,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said. \u201cIt allows me to serve woodcock at one table and hare at another because I don\u2019t have enough for everyone.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage in ditching the menu is that it reduces waste, as fewer ingredients are needed to be kept in stock.\n\n\u201cWe notice the difference, especially with seafood and pastry which you can now prepare at the last minute.\u201d\n\nHedone reflects a wider trend, according to \u201c50 Best\u201d director William Drew.\n\nThis is driven by customers\u2019 interest in being surprised by dishes, in an era when they will often be familiar with the restaurant\u2019s fare from Instagram.\n\n\u201cI think the idea of not having a menu is growing,\u201d Mr. Drew said.\n\n\u201cIt plays to the idea of diners having a \u201cbespoke experience\u201d which is tailored to their wants and needs, but in practice it also allows the chefs to have more freedom based on availability of ingredients and so forth.\u201d\n\nFrance and N.Y. too\n\nThe shift has also been noted in France and New York, but is likely to remain confined to gastronomic centres. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it really works in restaurants that are not destinations for foodies already,\u201d Mr. Drew said.\n\n\u201cYou have to earn the right to work on this basis, to have built a formidable reputation so that the diners trust the judgement of the staff and the chef.\u201d\n\nRestaurants following the trend in London include sushi restaurant Araki, which has two Michelin stars and offers a unique set menu, and the two-Michelin-starred Hibiscus which offers a surprise tasting menu in the evening.\n\nBut others are following outside the capital. The Checkers, in Montgomery in Wales offers between five and nine dishes a day in a tasting menu.\n\n\u201cWith an a la carte menu there will always be a degree of wastage,\u201d said Kathryn Francis, who manages the Michelin-starred restaurant.\n\n\u201cThis new format gives our kitchen team greater control over what they need to prepare.\u201d It also makes sense financially in a sector where margins are tight, Ms. Francis added.\n\n\u201cMany fine dining restaurants now offer tasting menus only \u2014 it is a reflection of the need to be minimising wastage \u2014 offering your guests the very best you can and maintaining a profitable and healthy business.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
