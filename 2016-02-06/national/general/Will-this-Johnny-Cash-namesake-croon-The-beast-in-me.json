It just fit perfectly,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said.\n\nWhile researchers did not pick up the tarantula directly at or outside the prison, Mr. Hamilton said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the tarantulas roamed free in the area. \u201cThey are found all over that area of Folsom, California and western foothills of Sierra Nevadas.\u201d\n\nPrior to this study, more than 50 different species of tarantulas were known in the United States, but they were poorly organised and some were misidentified as being different species when they were actually the same. Now, Hamilton and co-authors say there are 29 US tarantulas in the Aphonopelma genus, 14 of which are new to science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that so many previously described species were found to be invalid,\u201d said Marshal Hedin, a professor of biology at San Diego State University who was not involved with the work but described it as \"rigorous and much-needed.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
