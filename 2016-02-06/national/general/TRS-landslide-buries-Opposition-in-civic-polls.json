In the 2004 and 2009 elections, the Congress to approach the MIM for outside support to bag the Mayor and Deputy Mayor\u2019s posts.\n\nIf the recent Warangal parliamentary byelection gave a shock to the Opposition parties at the record majority secured by the TRS, the GHMC poll results were no different. The performance in the twin cities and its suburbs proved that TRS has come a long way from a lone corporator in 2004 to over 100 in 2016.\n\nThe Congress and TDP-BJP combine\u2019s performance lay in tatters as these parties could not cross the single digit mark.\n\nMajlis-ittehadul-Muslimeen was the second largest party in the GHMC having won 44 seats so far. The TDP-BJP combine settled for five divisions while the Congress won only two divisions.\n\nElated at the outcome, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao drove down Telangana Bhavan, the TRS headquarters where at a press conference overflowing with journalists, he said: \u201cPeople of Hyderabad from all regions have given a historic mandate to the TRS. Our responsibility towards the welfare and safety of all has increased.\u201d",
