As the chairman of the party\u2019s SC cell in Ghaziabad, Mr. Gaur was to attend the meeting, which was being held at the residence of Congress secretary for Uttar Pradesh, Lokesh Chaudhary.\n\nIn his letter to Ms. Gandhi, Mr. Gaur says that the moment he took his seat the party\u2019s district president Om Prakash Sharma berated him with hateful remarks.\n\nThe letter quotes Mr. Sharma as saying: \u201cHow come you are in this meeting? Your meeting is at 3 pm. This meeting is for big people. Small people like you have no role in this meeting.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr. Gaur, Mr. Sharma went on demeaning him: \u201cIf people from a Dhobi caste will sit with us, what would be left of our status? We don\u2019t need you here. Your place is under our feet.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , K. Raju, chairman of the SC department at the All India Congress Committee (AICC), said that he has asked the State unit to probe the matter and brief him by Saturday noon.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time such a complaint has come from a main party leader,\u201d said Mr. Raju. \u201cI\u2019m meeting him tomorrow just to ensure that we have taken his complaint seriously.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to Ms. Gandhi, Mr. Gaur has warned that he would commit suicide if the party doesn\u2019t take action against Mr. Sharma.\n\n\u201cThis incident has left a serious impact on my psychology,\u201d Mr. Gaur wrote in the letter. \u201cI want justice.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu, Mr. Sharma rejected Mr. Gaur\u2019s accusation saying caste had nothing to do with the incident.\n\n\u201cMy seniors had told me to invite former MPs, MLAs and other district leaders, so there was a criteria for the participants in which he (Gaur) did not fit,\u201d said Mr. Sharma.\n\nHowever, Bijender Yadav, general secretary, Uttar Pradesh Congress, confirmed to The Hindu that Mr. Sharma insulted Mr. Gaur by invoking caste. \u201cHe told Gaur that this meeting is for the people who come from a superior caste,\u201d said Mr. Yadav.",
