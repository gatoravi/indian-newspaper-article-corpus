    "text": "Reeling from criticism for allegedly influencing the suicide of Rohith Vemula, Dalit scholar at Hyderabad Central University, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Friday attempted to link his political affiliation to the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Owaisi brothers.\n\nSusheel Kumar, ABVP leader from HCU, alleged he was beaten up by members of the Ambedkar Students\u2019 Association (ASA) and also Rohith.\n\nAddressing the media in Mumbai, he sought a judicial inquiry into the suicide of Rohith Vemula. \u201cPunish me if I am guilty of any wrongdoing. I am ready for any action. But there should be a judicial inquiry into this incident,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHCU is missing a good student in the form of Rohith Vemula. He was my good friend, though we had completely opposite ideologies,\u201d said the ABVP leader.\n\nMr Kumar claimed that the HCU witnessed 12 suicides since 2007 but such a row was never created before. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t all these suicides be probed?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe ABVP leader, criticising the visits of political leaders such as Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal to the HCU campus, said interference from BJP ministers in the university affairs over actions of the ASA was not objectionable as they were people\u2019s representatives.\n\n\u201cRohith was earlier a Modi admirer but later became a Left sympathiser. Later, he had even said that MIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi is a leader to look forward to,\u201d claimed Mr Kumar.",
