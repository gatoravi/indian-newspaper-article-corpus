But the leaders reiterated their view to Mr. Gandhi \u201cthat the future of Arunachal Pradesh and that of the Congress is not at all secure in the hands of autocratic leader like Mr. Tuki.\u201d The leaders suggested Mr. Gandhi that Mr.Tuki should be replaced with \u201ca more matured and visionary leader,\u201d Kalikho Pul, who\u2019s the leader of dissident MLAs.",
