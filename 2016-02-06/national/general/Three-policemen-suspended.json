What we should now focus is only on the future and ensure such instances are not repeated. More than racism, there are small frictions between communities \u2013 the African students and the locals, which manifest sometimes,\u201d he said. He added that a system would be instituted where locals and African nationals meet often and iron out their differences.\n\nPartha Satpathy, Joint Secretary (States), Ministry of External Affairs, who was also part of the meeting said that they had come here to tell the students that the country cared for the security of African students and they were always welcome.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission has taken suo motu cognisance of the mob attack, while observing that it amounted to not only a serious violation of human rights of the student, but also racism.\n\nThe NHRC has issued notices to the Karnataka Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, asking them to submit a report within two weeks on the action taken by them. The Commission noted that when the student was allegedly stripped and forced to walk \u201cwithout her top\u201d, a constable, who was present at the scene, remained a mute spectator. She lodged a complaint with the police as well.\n\nAn earlier road accident in which a car driven by a Sudanese medico knocked down a local resident fatally had triggered a chain of events leading to the mob attack.",
