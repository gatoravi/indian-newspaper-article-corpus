Previously exempted. Is this the phasing out of exemptions by MoF? Sad.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw said: \u201cThe Department of Revenue has issued a notification on January 28, withdrawing exemption from import duty on a number of drugs, including cancer and other lifesaving drugs. This will result in excise/import duties to the extent of over 22 per cent, which will make these drugs more expensive\u2026 There are over 75 drugs on this list. This will also impact the indigenous drugs being manufactured in SEZs, thus adversely impacting the government\u2019s aim of making healthcare affordable and accessible to patients in India.\u201d",
