In other words, India\u2019s Nuclear Power Company (NPCIL) could, in its contract with the foreign supplier, provide an exemption to the supplier from being sued.\n\nHowever, that reading of the Act is at variance with some experts and Opposition Left party members who have consistently opposed the U.S. civil nuclear deal. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the Opposition would not allow \u201cany attempt to absolve suppliers of liability.\u201d \u201cThe government has taken its decision unilaterally, without waiting for Parliament or taking us into confidence over the move to ratify the CSC. We will not allow them to make any amendments now in order to bring the domestic law in line with its international commitments,\u201d Mr. Yechury told The Hindu .\n\nLegal expert Arghya Sengupta, who was part of consultations by the government on the nuclear law before U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s visit to India in 2015, says the CSC ratification may still not convince U.S. suppliers to commit. \u201cMy sense is this will still need a legal determination or adjudication by an Indian court. The ratification of the CSC by the government has only made this need more immediate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have done this under pressure from the U.S.,\u201d alleged former Atomic Energy Regulatory Board Chairman A.Gopalakrishnan, adding that unless a foreign supplier was held responsible and liable, \u201canother Bhopal tragedy-like situation may happen where Union Carbide walked away by paying very little.\u201d\n\nCPI leader and MP D. Raja too said they would raise the issue in the upcoming budget session, adding, \u201cThis lack of transparency over an issue of nuclear safety and compensation is troubling.\u201d\n\nThe Congress also took objection to the government move to ratify the CSC. Calling it a \u201cU-turn\u201d by the NDA/BJP, Congress party spokesperson Manish Tewari said, \u201cIn 2008, the NDA had brought a no confidence motion in Parliament over just this law, wanting all kinds of clauses to be inserted into the nuclear liability Bill, now goes and ratifies it in 2016 without even explaining its U-turn.\u201d",
