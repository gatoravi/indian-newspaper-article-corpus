    "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s initiative to scrutinise gender discrimination in Islamic laws of marriage and divorce met its first challenge when Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, a Maharashtra-based organisation, on Friday said the personal law drew its authority from the Koran and not from the Constitution.\n\nOn October 16 last year, the court had suo motu registered a public interest litigation (PIL) petition called \u201cMuslim women\u2019s quest for equality\u201d, empowering itself to find out if the current practices under the Muslim personal law were violative of the fundamental rights of equality and dignity.\n\nSettled factum\n\nThe Jamiat, which demanded the right to be heard, contested before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur that fundamental rights \u201ccannot touch upon\u201d the Muslim personal law. It said the factum that personal law was outside the ambit of fundamental rights had been settled by the apex court in past judgments.\n\nAccepting the organisation\u2019s application, the Bench agreed to set up an appropriate Bench to hear the matter. The case has been posted to be heard after six weeks.\n\n\u201cPersonal laws do not derive their validity on the ground that they have been passed or made by a legislature or other competent authority. The foundational sources of personal law are their respective scriptural texts,\u201d Jamiat said. \u201cThe Mohammedan law is founded essentially on the Holy Koran, and thus, it cannot fall within the purview of the expression \u2018laws in force\u2019 as mentioned in Article 13 of the Constitution.\u201d",
