    "text": "A worried BJP president Amit Shah has summoned the party\u2019s core group members from the Punjab unit for a meeting on Saturday, with the party\u2019s prospects looking bleak in Punjab in the Assembly polls in 2017, and noted cricketer and former MP Navjyot Singh Sidhu rebuffing attempts by the party to rope him for the campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are two basic things that the party president wants to discuss, one is about electing a new president for the State unit and the other is how to recover the party\u2019s prospects which are looking rather bleak,\u201d said a senior office-bearer in the party.\n\nSources also disclosed that the party had approached former MP Navjyot Singh Sidhu to be one of the main faces of the party\u2019s campaign in the State, not once but twice and had been strongly rebuffed by the former cricketer.\n\n\u201cHe made it clear that as long as the BJP was in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal, with whom he has serious differences, he would not be available for any campaigning,\u201d said the source.\n\nParty leaders fear that he might be in touch with the Aam Aadmi Party and might even switch over, finding that his issues were not being addressed in the BJP.\n\nThe alarm bells for the BJP started ringing when the cricketer\u2019s wife, also called Navjyot Sidhu, made a public statement suggesting that BJP voters would be better off if they cast votes for AAP rather than the BJP if it continued its alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal.",
