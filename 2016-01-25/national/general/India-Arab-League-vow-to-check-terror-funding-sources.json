The only distinction is between those who believe in humanity and those who do not. Terrorists use religion, but inflict harm on people of all faiths,\u201d said Ms. Swaraj, who arrived here on Saturday.\n\nThe Manama Declaration\n\nThe meeting, which was opened by Bahrain\u2019s Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, culminated with the two sides issuing a joint statement called the Manama Declaration.\n\nThe two sides discussed regional and global issues of mutual concern, including the Palestinian issue, developments in the Arab region and in South Asia, as well as counter-terrorism, Security Council reforms and nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe two sides condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and rejected associating it with any religion, culture or ethnic group.\n\nThey also emphasised the need for concerted regional and international efforts to combat terrorism and to address its causes and develop a strategy to eliminate the sources of terrorism and extremism, including its funding, as well as combating organised cross-border crime, the Declaration stated.\n\nIn this context, the two sides affirmed their respect to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and non-interference in its internal affairs and rejecting infringement of such principles, strongly condemned crimes committed by all terror organisations, especially those committed by the Islamic State. \u2014 PTI",
