    "text": "Scientists have discovered an inexpensive way to deliver carbon dioxide to micro-algae, which in turn can be harvested to make renewable fuels.\n\nCarbon dioxide speeds up the growth of micro-algae.\n\nHowever, the carbon dioxide (CO2) has to be free of contamination or the algae will die. Researchers from the Melbourne School of Engineering discovered that this new method purifies the carbon dioxide that is in power station flue gases by absorbing it into a liquid.\n\nThis liquid is then pumped through hollow fibre membranes. These hollow fibre membranes are like very long drinking straws, which can be immersed into the micro-algae beds, researchers said.\n\n\u201cIn this work, we have found a way to purify the carbon dioxide and to supply it to the micro-algae for a much more moderate cost and using a lot less energy,\u201d said Sandra Kentish from the University of Melbourne. \u2014 PTI",
