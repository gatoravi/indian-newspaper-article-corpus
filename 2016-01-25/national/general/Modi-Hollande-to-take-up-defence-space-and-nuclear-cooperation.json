Shortly after their meeting in Delhi on Monday, Mr. Modi and Mr. Hollande will travel to Gurgaon to inaugurate the International Solar Alliance Secretariat.\n\nOfficials said the two sides could announce new partnerships for more nuclear energy plants, while discussing the hurdles to land acquisition for the six-reactor 9,900-MW Jaitapur facility for which Areva and NPCIL signed an agreement in 2010.\n\nThe leaders will end the day by attending a banquet hosted by President Pranab Mukherjee and will officiate at the Republic Day parade on the morning of January 26. This is the fifth time a French President is being invited as the chief guest for the parade, marking a record honour for any country invited by India.",
