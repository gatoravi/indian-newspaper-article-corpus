    "text": "The series of arrests of alleged suspects in terror cases seems to have exposed the fact that the Karnataka Police \u201cfailed\u201d to keep track of two IT professionals who were deported from Turkey after being caught trying to cross over to Syria in January 2015.\n\nThe two have now gone untraceable and the failure to keep track of them has raised concern that State agencies are not \u201con the ball\u201d in tracking terror suspects, Intelligence Bureau sources say.\n\nBoth were part of a group of nine people, including five children, deported from Turkey.\n\nThe alleged \u201cleader\u201d of the group, Mohammed Abdul Ahad, who had taken his five children and wife in the attempt to cross the Syrian border allegedly to fight for the IS, has now been arrested.\n\nBut there are fears that one of the two techies could have fled from India. This is despite Central agencies asking the State police to keep track of the entire group.\n\nThe family of one of the two missing techies, Noufal, said he was in Saudi Arabia, but they do not have the documentation to support their claim, said an NIA official.\n\nEarlier this month, the city police were left stumped when the Delhi Police Special Cell arrested radical cleric Moulana Anzar Shah Qasmi for his alleged links with the Al-Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).\n\nQazmi, with whom all the arrested suspects were in touch, was under city police surveillance for nearly three months following tip-offs from the locality, but the surveillance inputs were not shared with other agencies and they failed to investigate him thoroughly.\n\nKarnataka Police \u2018failed\u2019 to keep track of two techies brought back to India",
