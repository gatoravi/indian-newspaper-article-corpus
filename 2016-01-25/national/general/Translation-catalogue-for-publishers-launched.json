But, the problem is that there are not adequate good translations of writers from different languages which hampers the reach of these writers,\u201d Sanjoy Roy, Managing Director, Teamwork Arts, said after the launch.\n\nFor its ongoing edition, the JBM has tied up with Daily Hunt, a distributor of Indian language e-books.\n\nThree books originally published in Hindi and one each in Bangla, Kannada, Assamese, Rajasthani and Gujarati are included in the global catalogue. \u2014 PTI",
