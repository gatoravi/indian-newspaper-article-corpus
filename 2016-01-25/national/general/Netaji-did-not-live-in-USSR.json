    "text": "The 100 government files declassified by India confirm that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose did not live in the former Soviet Union in or after 1945, said a U.K. website set up to chart the last days of the nationalist leader.\n\nThe Russian government informed the Indian Embassy in Moscow in 1992 and 1995 that there was no record of Bose being in the Soviet Union in or after 1945, the website bosefiles.info said as it reiterated its claim on December 7 denying that Bose escaped to the Soviet Union in 1945.\n\nThe website was set up in London to chronicle the truth about how Bose died.\n\nAs a maiden disclosure, it rendered redundant the speculation among a section of people that he escaped to the Soviet Union and was not killed in the plane crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945.\n\nNotes exchanged between the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and other Union Ministries in the mid-1990s uphold the revelation made by bosefiles.info that there were two replies from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to queries from the Indian Embassy stating its point. \u2014 PTI",
