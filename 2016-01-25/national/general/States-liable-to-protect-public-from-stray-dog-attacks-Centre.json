Biju, which said children were easy targets for stray dog attacks in the State. It said the victims of stray dog bites suffered due to lack of sufficient and timely health care at both government and private hospitals.\n\nThe petition evoked a strong reaction from the apex court Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra, who observed that a child\u2019s precious life should not be left to the mercy of a street dog.\n\n\u201cChildren are fundamental embodiment of human race and they deserve protection from any kind of attack by the stray dogs,\u201d Justice Misra observed while taking cognisance of the petition saying that there was a spike in street/stray dog bites incidents from 88,178 per year to more than one lakh per year. The Centre\u2019s response shows that the Kerala government is solely responsible for maintaining safety of the public against stray dogs. The Ministry urged the apex court to \u201cgive directions to the Kerala government to take immediate steps to protect the children from the dangerous attacks of stray dogs.\u201d\n\nIt asked the apex court to order the State government to direct its local municipal bodies to quell the danger as per the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.",
