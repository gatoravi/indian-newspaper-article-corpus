You\u2019ll always be safe at Life Pieces,\u201d says Jamar, who is nine years old.\n\nWard 7 of the US capital is home to 70,000 people \u2014 95 percent of them black \u2014 and has an unemployment rate more than double that of national levels.\n\n\u201cI prefer to do my homework here \u2014 it\u2019s not safe at Grandma\u2019s,\u201d Jamar, a bit shy at times, says. He is among 140 boys aged three to 17 who attend the Life Pieces to Masterpieces (LPTM) after school program each day.\n\nThe non-profit group, launched in 1996, provides an oasis of calm for young boys living in an area east of the U.S. Capitol that is prone to gang activity and where the murder rate is among the nation\u2019s highest.\n\nLPTM \u201cfocuses on the development of black men using the concept of artwork,\u201d explained executive director Selvon Malcolm Waldron, adding that \u201cIt\u2019s a safe space to be, in a loving environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I hear shootings, I\u2019m scared they will kill me, that they will shoot at me,\u201d said Michael, 11.\n\nLife Pieces helps students connect by choosing a theme after discussing it and meditating; create by working on a piece; contribute by working together on the artwork and celebrate by exhibiting the works.\n\nLast year, the group raised $22,000 from sales of the artwork. \u2014 AFP",
