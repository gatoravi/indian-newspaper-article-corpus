We have become a nation that seems to specialise in sound bites and photo opportunities,\u201d Mr. Tharoor said during a session at the ninth ZEE Jaipur Literature Festival, here.\n\nSpeaking at the session titled \u2018Swachh Bharat: The India Story\u2019 Mr. Tharoor lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for initiating the Swachh Bharat Mission, but ridiculed the government for resorting to short cuts. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Prime Minister [Modi] saying that this country needs more toilets than temples\u2026 Mr. Modi echoed that to the surprise of some of his Hindutva supporters, but in practice we need a change of mindset and it is the hardest thing to do,\u201d he said after citing the example of a canal cleanup project where he submitted a proposal for a canal cleanup to the Central government but didn't receive any response from the government.\n\n\u201cMr. Modi had announced the \u2018Swachh Bharat kosh\u2019 [fund]. Where is this \u2018kosh\u2019? So far I haven't seen a paisa from it for any cleaning activity,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the central government must provide the resources that could make up for the inadequate resources in the local areas and at the same time strengthen the hands of local leaders who want to make a difference.\n\nTaking a dig at some of the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who have been making hateful remarks against people who question the Central governments inaction over issues of religious hatred and killings he said, \u201cYou can't talk about Swachh Bharat while condoning bigotry, hatred, prejudice and asking people to go to Pakistan in your public dialogue.\u201d",
