In a related development, political party leaders, including VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan and Bharatiya Janata Party State unit president Tamilisai Soundarajan, have demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident. While senior police officers refused to comment, it is learnt that they have registered a case under IPC Sections 384 (extortion) and 306 (abetment to suicide) and provisions of the TN Prohibition of Harassment Act.\n\nCollege sealed; administrator\u2019s son and hostel wardens picked up for questioning",
