    "text": "A notification issued by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change prescribing regulations on river sand mining is feared to result in a mismatch with the State legislation on the issue, sparking concern over its implications on the protection of the ravaged rivers in Kerala.\n\nThe January 15 notification mandates the creation of a District Environment Impact Assessment Authority empowered to issue environmental clearance for sand mining below five hectares. In Kerala, district-level expert committees have been constituted to identify the locations for river sand mining. In June last year, the State government imposed a ban on sand mining from six rivers.",
