The IS emphasises the use of visuals in their recruitment modus operandi, with extensive use of pictures downloaded from various jihadi websites.\u201d\n\nHe said over 150 sites were currently under the radar of the security agencies.\n\nThe recent arrests of 14 individuals across India suspected of IS linkages showed fine inter-State coordination between the ATS and the NIA. Mr. Phansalkar said Muslim community leaders had been roped in for confidence-building measures.\n\nATS chief says\n\nthe squad is monitoring social media and other sites",
