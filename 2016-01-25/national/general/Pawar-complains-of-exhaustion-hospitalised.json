Mr. Pawar\u2019s health has been a source of constant speculation in recent years.\n\nIn 2013, he had complained of uneasiness while on a visit to Sangli district and was compelled to cut short his visit.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Pawar was admitted to Mumbai\u2019s Breach Candy Hospital.\n\nNationalist Congress Party leaders, eager to dispel alarm, then said Mr. Pawar had been hospitalised for \u201ca routine medical check-up\u201d.",
