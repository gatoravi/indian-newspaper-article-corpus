    "text": "Following heightened security in connection with Republic Day celebrations, the Chikkamagaluru police have banned the entry of people into the Guru Dattatreya Bababudan Swamy Dargah atop the Baba Budangiri near here. Security has been beefed up in pilgrimage centres of Sringeri and Horanadu.\n\nLearning lessons from past incidents elsewhere, the police are taking measures to prevent untoward incidents during the celebrations. Based on inputs from the Home Department, the district police have deployed additional forces.\n\nEntry of the public into the cave shrine, a disputed site, has been prohibited for three days from Sunday. This was communicated to the people visiting the dargah on Sunday morning. There is, however, no restriction on visiting the hills.\n\nK. Santhosh Babu, Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu on Sunday, \u201cWe have beefed up security in Sringeri, Horanadu, Lakkavalli, and Baba Budangiri. This is to avoid any untoward incident either before or during Republic Day celebrations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an all-India alert. There is no specific information on threat to any of the places in the district,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official said prohibiting entry into the cave shrine would not affect the public as the number visiting the place was very small.",
