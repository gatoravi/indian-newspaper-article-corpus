    "text": "It took M.K. Narasimhan 2,500 hours over five years to make a veena. But it is no ordinary musical instrument. The civil engineer from Mysuru wrought the veena out of a single log of rosewood using neither chisel nor hammer. He \u2018carved\u2019 it entirely out of sandpaper.\n\nAlthough wood from the jackfruit tree is the usual preference for a veena, Mr. Narasimhan, a retired Research Officer of the Dam Safety Cell of Karnataka Government, was drawn to rosewood.\n\nHe had never attempted to make a veena before, but said he enjoyed playing the instrument as a child. After years of researching different varieties of wood, he zeroed in on a five-foot-long piece of rosewood from the Titimati forest area near Kodagu. It was 150 years old and had been exposed to both the Northeast and Southwest monsoons. \u201cIt was a challenge as rosewood is known to splinter easily. But I wanted only rosewood as it is notches above jackfruit wood in sound propagation,\u201d he said. The polishing was done with a mixture of rare essential oils like tung oil of China, cedar oil, juniper oil and absolute rose oil.\n\nHe used bronze bridges to place the strings. \u201cThe frets are handmade with silver brought from Australia,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Narasimhan still has to string the veena. He spent Rs. 3 lakh making this unique veena, but it\u2019s not for sale. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can part with it,\u201d he said.",
