Mr. Modi reached Chandigarh \u2014 the city designed by French architect Le Corbusier \u2014 around 80 minutes after Mr. Hollande\u2019s arrival here at 1 p.m.\n\nThe high-profile visitors spent about 20 minutes at the Rock Garden. The duo then proceeded to the Capitol Complex, which includes the \u2018Open Hand Monument\u2019 besides the Secretariats, High Court and Legislative Assembly of Punjab and Haryana, designed by Le Corbusier.\n\nDenied entry\n\nBut the son of the late Nek Chand, creator of the iconic Rock Garden, alleged that a Prime Minister\u2019s security official asked him to leave the venue minutes before Mr. Modi joined Mr. Hollande for there.
