The area houses several ministerial bungalows and other vital installations.\n\nThe stolen vehicle, a white Santro (registration number: HR 51, T 6646), belongs to Dr. Col. Shailendra Singh from the Army, who was visiting the Lodhi Garden with his family. \u201cMr. Singh reached the area around noon and parked the car outside the Lodhi Road post office, opposite gate number 1 of Lodhi Garden. When they decided to leave around 2.45 p.m., they could not find the car and lodged a complaint with the police,\u201d said a police officer.\n\nFearing a security breach, the police immediately sounded an alert in all the districts. The car had not been traced till late Sunday evening.\n\nThis is the second incident raising security concerns in the National Capital Region in less than a week. On January 20, the official vehicle of an Indo-Tibetan Border Police Inspector General was stolen from outside his residence in Noida\u2019s Sector-23. A similar security alert was issued by the Delhi Police on Friday after the driver of an Alto car hired from Pathankot was found dead in Kangada.\n\nTheft comes 24 hours before the scheduled visit of French President Francois Hollande",
