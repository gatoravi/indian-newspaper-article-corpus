Such students, once their identity gets revealed, often get treated differently, says V. Krishna, a Dalit faculty member of the University of Hyderabad, who chaired a seven-member committee in 2013 to examine inter-caste bias on the campus.\n\nHe said the assertion of Dalit identity was seen as \u201cout of place\u201d as students often receive bad treatment as soon as they revealed their lower caste backgrounds.\n\nMr. Krishna, who recently laid down his position as the Controller of Examinations, has a long association with the UoH. From1982 to 1983, he studied there in the Hindi department. He remembers what he called \u201ca type of ghettoisation\u201d he and his fellow Dalit students had to go through. \u201cThere was no choice but to be in the company of each other,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Dalit PhD scholar Rohith Vemula\u2019s suicide brought to the fore caste-based discrimination on campuses in Hyderabad, Mr. Krishna was not surprised as he and other faculty members on eight different campuses in Hyderabad had predicted that the ongoing suppression might push the lower caste students to dangerous extremes.\n\nThe case of M. Venkatesh, a Dalit research scholar at UoH who committed suicide in 2013, is still fresh in memory. The seven-member team led by Mr. Krishna probed whether caste-based prejudice had something to do with the suicide. The committee pointed out in the end that \u201cthe institution and the system\u201d had driven him to death.\n\nSuicides in higher education are quite rampant in Hyderabad. Five Dalit students committed suicide between 2005 and 2015 in the UoH alone. In Osmania University, two women students \u2014 Malleswari, a Bahujan, and Rajitha, a Dalit \u2014 had killed themselves in 2007 and 2011 respectively. In 2013, two Muslim students committed suicide at English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU).\n\nRecalling the time when he pursued his PhD in Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, Mr. Krishna said that as the Mandal Commission recommendations were implemented \u201cthe caste divide surfaced in a big way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat brought me to the core of Dalit politics,\u201d said Mr. Krishna.Mr. Krishna is not the only one in the UoH who believes that institutional bias is equally responsible for the series of suicides the campus has recorded in the last few years. According to most senior faculty members in the city, including the 14 Dalit teachers of the UoH who laid down their administrative posts recently, \u2018ostracisation\u2019 of students coming from marginalised sections on campuses is a matter of routine.\n\n\u201cIn Venkatesh\u2019s case it was non-allotment of research supervisor or guide that led to the suicide. In the case of P. Raju, who killed himself in the same year, non-publication of results had led to the suicide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDalit students find it difficult to get past the biases that surface in all modern academic spaces as teachers, staff and administrators are not concerned about them.\u201d",
