    "text": "Political parties in Bihar on Sunday vied with one another to celebrate the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur in an apparent attempt to woo the Extremely Backward Class the socialist leader belonged to.\n\nWhile Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called for conferring Bharat Ratna to the late leader posthumously, the BJP charged that both the ruling JD(U) and the RJD \u201chave no right to\u201d celebrate Karpoori Thakur jayanti as \u201cthey have forged an alliance with the Congress party to be in power.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the fight between the BJP and ruling JD(U) over Sri Krishna Memorial Hall as a venue to celebrate the occasion reached the Patna High Court.\n\nThe court, however, allowed the JD(U) to organise the function at the venue but BJP State president Mangal Pandey said, \u201cThough, on some technical grounds, the court allowed the JD(U) to organise the function there, we\u2019ll appeal against the judgment with the division bench and not leave the matter there\u201d.\n\n\u201cHad the BJP requested me for the same venue to celebrate Karpoori Thakur jayanti, I would have given it to them. But I wonder since when have they started celebrating the birth anniversary of Karpoori Thakur, who was a great socialist leader?\u201d asked Mr. Nitish Kumar a day after the court verdict.\n\nLater, like the RJD, the BJP too decided to celebrate the occasion at the party headquarters.\n\nBesides it, other parties like Lok Janshakti Party, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Jan Adhikar Party too celebrated the occasion in the State capital with the respective leaders garlanding portrait of the leader.",
