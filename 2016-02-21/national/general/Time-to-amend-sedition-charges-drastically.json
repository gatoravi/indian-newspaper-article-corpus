Sedition is invoked. One\u2019s patriotism is questioned,\u201d he said. Former Editor of The Hindu Malini Parthasarathy pointed out that JNU got 3.9 out of 4 in the National Assessment Accreditation Council (NAAC) ranking in 2012 \u2013 the highest ranking for any educational institution in the country.\n\nObserving that the attack on JNU was an attack on the idea of India as originally meant to be in the Constitution, she said the freedom of speech and spirit of inquiry were the essence of academic pursuit. \u201cNationalism is of the people, of the communities coming together, it can\u2019t be imposed by a State, which, in a democracy, is an instrument of the people. That\u2019s why governments should respect the voice of the people and protect the right to dissent,\u201d she said. Dr. Parthasarathy also released a booklet containing the Vemula\u2019s note and Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s speech, and the first copy was received by Congress spokesperson Khushboo Sundar.\n\nFormer Vice-Chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University V. Vasanthi Devi discussed how the idea of nationalism was being misused by certain groups. \u201cWith a national flag in hand, it looked as if anything can be justified.\u201d Former JNUSU general secretary Elangovan Kaniappan spoke.",
