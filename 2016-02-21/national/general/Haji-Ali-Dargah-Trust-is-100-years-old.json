    "text": "The Haji Ali Dargah Trust, which manages the Haji Ali shrine in the Arabian Sea in Worli, on Saturday completed 100 years and plans to commemorate the centenary year with a host of events.\n\n\u201cHaji Ali Dargah is nearly 600 years old, but the deed of the Haji Ali Dargah Trust completed 100 years on Saturday. It was signed on February 20, 1916, and the trust has since looked after the dargah,\u201d said trustee Suhail Khandwani.\n\nTo commemorate the occasion, the trust has invited a Sufi Qawwali group, Fanna-Fi Allah from California to perform at the shrine. \u201cThis qawwali group is unique. It is the first international qawwali group comprising westerners,\u201d Mr Khandwani told The Hindu. The trust will also lay the foundation stone for the restoration of the dargah premises.\n\nThe Haji Ali Dargah houses the tomb of an Iranian Sufi saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari and is located in the middle of the sea off the crescent-shaped Worli waterfront. The shrine is revered by followers of all religions, and is accessible only during low tides through a stone pathway connecting the shores. \u201cWhatever is known about Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari (RA) is learnt from the caretakers and trustees from generation to generation as the Saint never married and has no descendents,\u201d the trust website states.",
