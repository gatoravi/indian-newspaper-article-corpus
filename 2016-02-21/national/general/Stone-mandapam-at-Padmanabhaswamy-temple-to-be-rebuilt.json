This was decided at a meeting chaired by District Collector Biju Prabhakar here on Saturday.\n\nThe Nirmithi Kendra, that has been entrusted with the task of renovating the pond and the surroundings, would hire a conservation engineer before proceeding with the renovation work. At each stage of the work, a committee of local people and believers headed by the local corporation councillor would be briefed.\n\n\u201cThe stone mandapam, historically important, was demolished by the Nirmithi Kendra without consulting anyone. The representatives of the Archaeology Department who were present at many a meeting on the renovation work did not raise any objection at any stage. Now the mandapam would be reset to its former shape,\u201d Mr. Prabhakar said here on Saturday.\n\nThe historically important mandapam was demolished beginning February 16 to make way for a walkway planned as part of the renovation work. The stone pillars of the mandapam located in a declared heritage zone were demolished using an earthmover. Only when workers arrived on Friday to resume the demolition work did local people realise what was going on. On Friday when news of the demolition spread, members of the royal family of erstwhile Travancore, Aswathy Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi and her son Aditya Varma, reached the spot to protest against the demolition. It was after an assurance from the Collector that the demolition would not be resumed that the duo agreed to end to their protest.\n\nMembers of the erstwhile royal family had protested its demolition",
