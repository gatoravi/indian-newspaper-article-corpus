They were, however, disrupted for a short while by ABVP members.\n\nStating that DU was not a saffron campus and stood with the JNU in the time of crisis, Abha Dev Habib, professor at Delhi University, said: \u201cFrom the past few days, we are seeing that the BJP is running a shrill campaign branding all those who dissent as anti-nationals. The ABVP is organising a march in different colleges spreading jingoism and terror between the student communities. DU, like other campuses, is not a saffron campus and any such move to impose saffron agenda must be resisted\u201d.\n\nA PhD student, Remya Sharma, who was among those participating in the meeting, said that she supported the ongoing agitation.\n\n\u201cI am not affiliated with any political party but I believe that a university should be a space where all sorts of debates and discussions should happen\u201d, she said.\n\nVishwajeet, national general secretary of the AISF said, \u201cIt is really shameful and disheartening that some media is using their full might to establish that the JNU students are involved in anti-national activities. We will challenge this through our movement across the country in the coming days\u201d.\n\nThe meeting took place amidst opposition from nearly a dozen ABVP members who shouted slogans such as \u201c Jo Afzal ka saath dega woh Afzal ki maut marega (those who support Afzal will die like him)\u201d.\n\nThe police prevented a clash between ABVP members and the protesting students, numbering a little over 100. \u201cNo one has been detained and the situation was brought under control in due time\u201d, DCP (North) Madhur Verma said.\n\n\u201cThe way they are demanding the release of Kanhaiya is not acceptable to us and, therefore, we are here to oppose the meeting. Support for Afzal and opposing the nationalistic ethos of the country will not be tolerated\u201d, said Delhi unit secretary of ABVP, Bharat Khatana.\n\nHe said that the ABVP had given a \u201cSansad Gherao\u201d call on January 24 at Jantar Mantar where they will demand the suspension of the Members of Parliament who have supported Kanhaiya.",
