    "text": "Amid speculations of discontent among several Left Front constituents over the Left-Congress alliance, Left Front chairperson and Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Biman Bose said on Saturday that for the sake of larger Left unity all the allies including the CPI (M) have to make sacrifices.\n\n\u201cAll the Left Front constituents have to make sacrifices and the CPI (M) has to make even a bigger sacrifice,\u201d said Mr. Bose. His comment comes in the backdrop of several Front constituents reportedly refusing to give a share of their seats to the Congress even in case a Left-Congress alliance is finalised.\n\nHowever, in a Left Front meeting last week all the 11 constituents of the Front \u201cunanimously\u201d agreed to sit for a discussion with the Congress if the latter makes any official proposal for an alliance.",
