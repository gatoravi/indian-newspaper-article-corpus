My own personal development is one. My own personal task is to read a book a week, and also to read a book a month as part of my book club... I\u2019m reading a lot this year, and I want to do a lot of listening. I want to listen to as many different women in the world as I can,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she will also be part of a HeForShe arts week and a university tour. \u2014 PTI",
