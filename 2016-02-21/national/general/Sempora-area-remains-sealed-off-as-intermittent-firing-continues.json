    "text": "Intermittent firing was going on between militants who occupied a government building in the Sempora area of south Kashmir and security forces even late in the evening on Saturday. The area remains sealed off and the highway closed for traffic.\n\n\u201cAll civilians are out of the building. We have received no message of any hostage,\u201d Inspector-General of Police Syed Javaid Mujtaba Gillani said. \u201cWe are not sure how long the operation will take. We are working on it.\u201d One civilian, who works as a gardener, received a bullet injury in the leg. Security forces had to quell stone-throwing protesters at Pampore, as people thronged the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway as news spread.\n\nTwo militants were killed in the same area on December 8, 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt.Gen. K J Singh, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, has opposed revocation of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Disturbed Areas Act (DAA) in the State. \u201cWe should continue with the AFSPA and the DAA. There is a kind of defining stage as there is now reduced infiltration. We have brought down the level of insurgency. So we should continue with these \u2026 ,\u201d he said.",
