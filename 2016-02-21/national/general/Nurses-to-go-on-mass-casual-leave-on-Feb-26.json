Pant, Guru Teg Bahadur, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, PGI Chandigarh, etc, are taking part in the relay hunger strike on at Jantar Mantar.\n\nNurses working in government hospitals across the country have stated that with regard to the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations, only provisional pay fixation has been done for nurses whereas all other employees have been given a new salary scale.\n\nNurses are protesting under the banner of the All India Government Nurses Federation and have said that they will intensify their strike in case they don\u2019t get a positive response from the government soon.\n\nThe national executive of the Federation had decided to initially hold a 15-day relay hunger strike from February 12 in support of their demand. The Federation secretary-general, G.K. Khurana, said that nurses working in government hospitals are facing huge anomalies in terms of their salary. \u201cThe salary we are getting is much less compared to the work load that we are forced to undertake each day,\u201d said Mr. Khurana.",
