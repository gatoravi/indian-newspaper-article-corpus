This is not the final piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn view of the shortage of time and given that these were to serve only as prototypes to a limited list of persons, we went ahead. We would clearly mention that the Final Freedom 251 manufactured/assembled in India would be to identical specs - i.e. no change,\u201d he added.\n\nBesides, the firm has also come under the scanner of the Excise and Income Tax departments, with the I-T Department looking into the financial structure of the Noida-based company. \u201cYes, there was a visit from excise department and income tax department\u2026They issued us some guidelines for future and extended full support and co-operation,\u201d Mr. Chadda added.\n\nExcise and I-T department are looking into the financial structure of the company",
