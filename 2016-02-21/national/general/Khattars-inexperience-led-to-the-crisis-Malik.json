We are planning to meet Union Home minister Rajnath Singh to request the Centre\u2019s intervention,\u201d he said on Saturday, vowing to intensify the agitation for demanding reservation for the Jats.\n\nThe State government, he said, was trying to break up the Jat agitation by spreading the message that it was \u201cleaderless\u201d.\n\nAt a media interaction in the morning, DGP Y.P. Singhal called the agitation \u201cleaderless\u201d and said the involvement of \u201csome agitators\u201d from outside the State could not be ruled out. He said 129 cases had been registered against the agitators. Mr. Khattar appealed again to the agitators to end their protest, saying the government had accepted their demands. \u201cNo one will benefit from damage to public property. Hence, those agitating should maintain peace and do not get swayed by rumours,\u201d he said.",
