    "text": ": Taps ran dry in large parts of the Capital on Saturday after protesters in Haryana forced shut the gates at the inlet of the Munak Canal \u2014 one of the main sources of raw water to Delhi.\n\nMembers of the Jat community have been demanding reservation in Haryana, and their protests escalated into violence on Saturday. A bunch of protestors had disrupted supply by blocking Munak Canal\u2019s gates on Friday evening, but the local police had managed to open the gates after a few hours. But, the protestors were back on Saturday and the gates were once again closed.\n\nSupply through Munak Canal, which brings 719 cusecs of water to Delhi, remained disrupted through the day.\n\nWith raw supply being hit, seven of the Delhi Jal Board\u2019s water treatment plants stopped production, leading to a severe lack of water in West, North-West, Central, South and parts of North Delhi. Even residences of Members of Parliament in Lutyens\u2019 Delhi faced water shortage. The DJB said that of the 820 million gallons per day (MGD) of water produced by the nine treatment plants, only 240 MGD was produced on Saturday. With rationing of supplies on Saturday, the DJB managed to save some water and will be able to provide 60 per cent of the supply on Sunday. However, if the situation is not resolved by the morning, Delhi will be in the middle of a full-blown crisis, said a senior DJB official.\n\nDelhi moves SC\n\nMeanwhile, the Delhi government on Saturday moved the Supreme Court, seeking a direction to the Centre to intervene and ensure water supply to the national capital from Munak Canal in Haryana which has been affected due to the Jat stir.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",
