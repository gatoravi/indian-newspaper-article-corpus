    "text": "The Tamil Nadu Assembly on Saturday unanimously passed bills amending municipal and panchayat laws to increase the percentage of reservation for women from 33 to 50. S.P. Velumani, Minister for Municipal Administration and Rural Development, moved the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016, and Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Amendment Act, 2016. Moving the bills, he said that the laws relating to the urban and rural local bodies provide for reservation of one-third of the total number of seats and offices for women. The government considers it necessary to increase it to fifty per cent to promote women empowerment and facilitate participation of women in urban and rural development. Accordingly, the government decided to amend the various municipal laws and the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 suitably. This will ensure reservation of 50 per cent of seats and offices in municipal corporations, municipalities, town panchayats, district panchayats, panchayat union councils and village panchayats. As the Minister began his speech praising Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, who was not in her chair, Speaker P. Dhanapal asked him to cut it short and introduce the bills fast.",
