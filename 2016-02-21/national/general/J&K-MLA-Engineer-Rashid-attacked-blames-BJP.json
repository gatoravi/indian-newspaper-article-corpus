However, he escaped unhurt.\n\n\u201cWhen we reached the Bhamla area of Rajouri district, some BJP and RSS goons attacked my vehicle with stones and dragged me out,\u201d said Mr. Rashid. \u201cThey shouted slogans \u2018Bharat Mai Rehna Hai, Ram Ram Kehna Hai, Pakistan Murdabad\u2019,\u201d alleged Mr. Rashid.\n\nThe MLA was on the way to attend his party meeting in the Pir Panchal area of the Jammu region.\n\n\u201cThe police acted as mute spectators and didn\u2019t stop the Hindutva terrorists,\u201d alleged Mr. Rashid.\n\nThe attack comes at a time when the PDP reportedly asked the coalition partner BJP to rein in its supporters from \u201cencouraging any polarisation of the State on religious lines.\u201d\n\nSources said the PDP, which is re-engaging the BJP over the government formation, is expressed unhappiness over the coalition partner\u2019s judicial activism over the issues like beef ban and State flag.\n\nIn the past too, Mr. Rashid came under attack in the Jammu region for his attempt to expand into the Muslim belts.",
