The Goods and Services Tax Bill (GST) and the Bankruptcy Code Bill have been deferred to the second half of the Budget Session when it reconvenes in April.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha, where the government has a disadvantage with numbers, has in the last few sessions become the theatre of opposition politics.",
