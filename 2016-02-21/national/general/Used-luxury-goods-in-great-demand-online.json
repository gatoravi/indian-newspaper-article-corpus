    "text": "Used apparel, shoes, watches and other coveted luxury items, are now in great demand if they carry premium brand tags. Online sellers are now opening a window on their portals, to list and sell such products, alongside their catalogue of new items.\n\nPre-owned is the new coinage as it is not correct anymore to term these goods as second-hand anymore. And, often it is difficult to tell the difference.\n\nThe product categories that are most in demand are handbags, clutches scarves, shoes, apparel and fashion-jewellery and the top brands by sales are Lois Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Michael Kors, Burberry, Tag Heuer, Longines and Armani.\n\nOnline sellers, presently catering to this segment say that the demand for the used luxury goods are from metros as well as smaller cities and towns. Gifts and used-items are often uploaded directly on websites that are dedicated to luxury products, after which authentication checks are carried out\n\nDedicated teams\n\nAs important as the authentication is the refurbishment of the old goods to increase their allure and most online portals have dedicated teams for extensive refurbishment jobs ranging from removing stains to restoration, re-colouring and thorough sanitisation.",
