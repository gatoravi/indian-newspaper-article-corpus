    "text": "With talks between the ruling alliance partners gaining pace in Jammu and Kashmir after BJP leader Ram Madhav paying a less-publicised visit to Srinagar to meet PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, several issues were thrashed out between the two parties.\n\nSources said three issues were flagged at the meeting between BJP president Amit Shah and PDP leader Haseeb Drabu, Finance Minister in the previous PDP-BJP government.\n\n\u201cThe first was about re-examining the financial package announced earlier for flood relief in the State. The second was the handover of National Hydroelectric Power Corporation projects in Dulhasti and Uri to the State. The Centre may grant funds to the State government to buy into these projects and take a majority stake,\u201d a top source said.\n\nThe third issue was the inclusion of Srinagar in the Centre\u2019s flagship Smart City plan.\n\n\u201cNo call has been taken on the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act,\u201d the source said.\n\nWith the death of Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, the State has been without a government for long, nearly a year after the PDP and the BJP formed one after striking an unlikely alliance. Ms. Mufti, who took over the reins of the PDP after her father\u2019s death, insisted on a full mourning period and time to resolve pending issues with the BJP. This resulted in Governor\u2019s rule in the State, with Governor N.N. Vohra taking charge of things.",
