    "text": "\u201cThe city [Rohtak in Haryana] is engulfed in smoke. We are scared to leave our homes. Today, we hid our cars because anything that is on the road is being burnt or damaged,\u201d says Komal Singhmar, an intern at PGI, Rohtak, reacting to the agitation by Jats demanding reservation under OBC category.\n\nSpeaking in a shaky voice on the phone, Ms. Singhmar continues: \u201cStores have been looted and a mall nearby has been burnt. We can constantly hear glass breaking, people shouting and gunshots being fired.\u201d\n\nThe curfew and \u2018shoot at sight\u2019 orders in Rohtak, some 70 km from the national Capital, have ensured that people remain indoors. \u201cWe are confined to our homes. The only people you see on the roads are those who are agitating. Petrol pumps have gone dry and there is shortage of LPG cylinders,\u201d rues advocate Yogendra Dahiya, who practises in district courts.\n\nThe city, meanwhile, is virtually cut off and mobile phones work erratically. SMS and Internet services are down for the past five days. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to get any groceries for almost a week. We don\u2019t know how long we can manage,\u201d Ms. Singhmar says.\n\nWhat is worrying the locals is that anti-social elements are having a free run. Incidents of vandalism, looting and damaging public property have become common and the police and military personnel are not overtly visible to inspire confidence.\n\nAccording to Mr. Dahiya, the agitation is leaderless. \u201cIt has, in fact, deviated from the real issue and become a chaos-causing agent. Youths have hijacked the agitation. They fuelled the chaos by expressing lack of faith in the khap and sangarsh samiti leaders. The government underestimated the situation and now it has gone out of hand.\u201d",
