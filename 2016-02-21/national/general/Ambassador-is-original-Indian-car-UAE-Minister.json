He recalled his first ride in an Ambassador, which had ruled Indian roads for more than five decades, during his maiden visit to the country several years ago.\n\nWhen Mr. Al Gergawi got out of the hotel room, a luxury Benz car of the Kerala government was ready to take him to a dinner organised by a Gulf-based Keralite business tycoon M.A. Yusuf Ali at his residence.\n\nThough he got into the luxury car, he expressed his wish to travel in the Ambassador car specially arranged for him by Mr. Yusuf. The car was made part of his convoy after Mr. Al Gergawi expressed his wish to the businessman before starting his Kerala visit. \u2014 PTI",
