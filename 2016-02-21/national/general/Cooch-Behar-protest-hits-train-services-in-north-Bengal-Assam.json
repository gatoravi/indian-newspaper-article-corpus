    "text": "Train services were paralysed for over 12 hours in north Bengal and Assam on Saturday following a \u2018rail roko\u2019 agitation in West Bengal\u2019s Cooch Behar district.\n\nThe blockade was organised by the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association (GCPA) in support of the demand for statehood or union territory status for Cooch Behar. Hundreds of people squatted on the tracks and shouted slogans demanding a separate State.\n\n\u201cWe tried to raise our demand time and again but none took heed of us. We have been forced to organise this blockade,\u201d GCPA general secretary Bangshi Badan Barman told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Barman said he was in talks with the railways and district authorities, but no breakthrough could be achieved.\n\n\u201cAll we want is a meeting with parties concerned to discuss the issue,\u201d he said. Mr. Barman said Cooch Behar enjoyed the status of a C category State for around three months in 1949 when it was included in India through a pact between the then Maharaja of Cooch Behar and the Government of India.",
