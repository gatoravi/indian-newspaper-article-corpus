She had also opposed #BabaRamdev in #JNU.#Nationfirst\u201d, wrote Mr.Pandit. In another tweet, he claimed Ms.Shora, who is at the forefront of the campaign to release JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, was \u201cconnected to Hurriyat\u201d.\n\nRetorting to volleys of tweets hurled at Ms.Shehla, Mr.Abdullah wrote, \u201cNow, being a Kashmiri Muslim is a crime enough to warrant interrogation. BTW, it\u2019s Shehla not Shiela, but what the hell!!\u201d\n\nTaking umbrage, Mr.Pandit wrote back: \u201cDid I say that being KM is a crime? Ur thinking is communal, not mine. Interrogation for organising #AnyiIndiaRally\u201d.\n\nTo which Mr.Abdullah retorted: \u201cI\u2019m a Kashmir Muslim AND I\u2019m not a Ramdev supporter/follower. I\u2019d better prepare for my interrogation\u201d.\n\nLater, Mr.Pandit blamed Mr.Abdullah and his father for migration of Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nAn M.Phil student, Ms.Shora shot into the limelight for her fiery speech on the detention of Mr.Kumar, which went viral on the social networking sites.",
