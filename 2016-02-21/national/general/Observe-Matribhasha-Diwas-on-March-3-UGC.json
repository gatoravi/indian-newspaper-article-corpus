While educational institutions thought they do not have to conduct any activities on \u2018Matribhasha Diwas\u2019 on February 21 as it happens to be a Sunday, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked them to observe the day on March 3 instead.\n\n\u2018Matribhasha Diwas\u2019 is otherwise observed as International Mother Language Day across the world. The theme for 2016 is \u2018Quality education, language(s) of instruction and learning outcomes.\u2019\n\nAccording to an earlier letter by the UGC to education institutions, they are expected to organise \u201celocution, debating, singing, essay writing competitions, painting competitions, music and drama performances, exhibitions, online resources and activities as well as events exploring the cognitive, economic, social and cultural activities of multilingual society.\u201d\n\nThese activities, the UGC says, could be organised \u201cpreferably in at least two languages, possibly more.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is enthused about having to organise events to mark the day. \u201cIn fact, there are too many of these \u2018days\u2019 that the UGC is asking institutions to observe. Every now and then, we have to comply with the directions as the UGC also has pressures from some corners. However, we try and organise events for those that we feel have some benefit to the students,\u201d said a Vice-Chancellor of a university, on condition of anonymity.\n\nInstitutions are being asked to observe too many \u2018days\u2019, says a\n\nVice-Chancellor",
