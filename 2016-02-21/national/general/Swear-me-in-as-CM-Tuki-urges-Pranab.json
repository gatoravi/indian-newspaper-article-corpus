Ms. Gandhi assured Mr. Tuki that he is the only elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party in Arunachal Pradesh and the party is \u201cfully backing\u201d him in his fight to re-establish his government.\n\nIn his letter to the President, Mr. Tuki argues that Mr. Pul cannot replace him as the Chief Minister since he is not the elected member of the Congress Legislature Party. If his claim to the position is not rejected, Mr. Tuki emphasises in the letter, it would be in violation of the party discipline, which would amount to the \u201cbreach\u201d of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nWhile addressing a press briefing here, Mr. Tuki blamed the RSS and the BJP for his ouster.",
