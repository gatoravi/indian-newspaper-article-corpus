Therefore, improving soil health is one of the most important issues in agriculture especially in irrigated areas where extensive use of urea has resulted in deterioration in soil health,\u201d he told a press conference here.\n\nImproving soil\n\nCentre had been emphasising on improving the health of soil by integrated nutrient management and had announced a programme of collection of soil samples, conduct analysis and issuance of soil health card in a time bound manner.\n\n\u201cMany of our farmers are not able to get the optimal yields from their fields, as they are not aware of the soil conditions. Our goal is to communicate benefits of soil health to the farmers so that they can apply appropriate dosage of fertilisers to increase productivity and profitability,\u201d said Mr. Radha Mohan.\n\nHealth cards\n\nHe said the government decided to provide soil health cards to 14 crore farmers of the country.\n\n\u201cFive crore farmers will be provided these card in 2015-16 and remaining farmers will be given the cards in 2016-17,\u201d he said pointing out that under the Soil Health Card Scheme Rs. 109 crore have been released till December 2015.\n\nThe Minister said the national e-Market will be launched by March 2016 under the National Agriculture Market Scheme (NAM).\n\n\u201cAs many as 20 States have expressed interest in linking their markets (mandis). While 200 mandis will be connected by September 2016, another 200 mandis will be connected by March 2017,\u201d he said.",
