I have been working with Disney for 40 years and chose them as the custodians of Star Wars because of my great respect for the company and Bob Iger\u2019s leadership,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nThe director had hinted earlier that he was not very happy with the new movie The Force Awakens Lucas criticised the \u201cretro\u201d tone of the seventh instalment of the series and jokingly compared Dis ney to \u201cwhite slavers\u201d which had bought his \u201ckids\u201d. \u201cThese are my kids. All the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 films. I love them, I created them, I\u2019m very intimately involved in them,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nIn his statement later, Lucas said, \u201cDisney is doing an incredible job of taking care of and expanding the franchise.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
