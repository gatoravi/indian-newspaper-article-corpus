The State of Jammu and Kashmir having its own flag is a position which as per law is not sustainable and is open to analysis,\u201d the BJP\u2019s lawyer pleaded before the court.\n\nTo douse any growing friction with the PDP, Minister of State in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) Jitender Singh told reporters in New Delhi that \u201cthe Jammu and Kashmir government as well as the legislature has the prerogative to take a view on these issues. I am also sure that they are capable enough to take a view and proceed accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe Former Chief Minister and NC working president, Omar Abdullah, however, accused Mr. Sayeed of \u201cnot defending the State\u2019s dignity from the nefarious plans of allies.\u201d \u201cSo long as J&K is a part of India, the two flags will continue to fly and we\u2019ll take pride in it\u2026Why is only J&K expected to respect the terms of accession while the rest of the country can disregard them with impunity,\u201d Mr. Abdullah asked.\n\nSupporting Mr. Abdullah\u2019s views, NC spokesman Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi said: \u201cThe State flag continues to derive its validity and sanctity from the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which is a fact that cannot be wished away in the din of political rhetoric and statements. This appeal for a stay order was filed by a BJP leader, who was represented by BJP spokesperson and advocate Sunil Sethi. It is evident the BJP is mounting a legal offensive to challenge the State\u2019s constitutional autonomy. The PDP\u2019s continued nexus with the BJP makes it complicit and culpable.\u201d\n\nCPI(M) leader Muhammad Yousuf Tarigami said: \u201cThe silence of the PDP on such an important issue makes it clear that it is playing with the wishes and aspirations of the people of Kashmir.\u201d\n\nDefending the case for having two flags, PDP leader and political adviser to Mr. Sayeed, Waheed Parra said: \u201cEven before the recent judgment, the State abided by the use of two flags, a right drawn from the Constitution. It should not be seen through the separatist prism, but a federal one\u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Advocate-General Jahangir Iqbal said: \u201cThe State government will respond only after going through the copies of the judgment. It will be premature to say anything at this stage.\u201d",
