He questioned the current government\u2019s record in implementing the Lokpal and Lok Ayukta Bill passed by Parliament. In his three-page letter in Hindi, Mr. Hazare says, \u201cPeople were upset with the previous government for rising corruption, and before the Lok Sabha elections in April-May 2014, you had assured the people that when your party comes to power, fighting corruption will be your priority. People believed that after your government comes to power, they will get a corruption-free India.\u201d",
