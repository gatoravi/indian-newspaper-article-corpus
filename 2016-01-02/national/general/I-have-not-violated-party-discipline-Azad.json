    "text": "BJP MP and former cricketer Kirti Azad has questioned the party for serving a show-cause notice on him, saying his pursuance of the issue of corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association has no link to it and even Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cannot seek \u201cthe shield of party discipline\u201d in this matter.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Azad made a point-by-point rebuttal of the charges in the notice slapped on him. He had been pursuing the issue of corruption in the DDCA for the past nine years \u201cwithout any let-up\u201d and was not once told by the BJP not to pursue it. He said that he had not \u201cnamed Mr. Jaitley or any party person\u201d in the issue and it was not the party\u2019s assignment that Mr. Jaitley was carrying out as president of the DDCA.\n\nReferring to previous BJP chiefs who had refrained from upbraiding him on the issue, he said, \u201cAll three respected party presidents also realised that cricket had no connection with our party activities and Mr. Jaitley\u2019s role in DDCA was his own concern.\u201d He did not name them.\n\n\u201cNot one office-bearer, apart from Mr. Jaitley, has reason to feel aggrieved by me or the cricketers\u2019 [Bishan Singh Bedi and others] complaint of wrongdoings in DDCA,\u201d he added.",
