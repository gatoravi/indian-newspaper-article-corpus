While Mr. Yadav, a 1983-batch officer retired after only six months as DGP, Mr. Ahmed has five more years of service. Mr. Ahmed was serving as the DG, Railways, in Lucknow. The Patna-born officer enjoys a clean image and a good record in policing. He also served as a joint director in the Central Bureau of Investigation during his central deputation. Mr. Ahmed said his priorities would be to build the people\u2019s trust in the U.P. police force. \u201cWe will work to build the trustworthiness and sensitivity of the police force, and improve their professional capacity. Lead by example, those officers who don\u2019t understand or are lax, would be picked out,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ahmed is also the second Muslim DGP in the three-and-a-half year rule of the Samajwadi Party. Rizwan Ahmed served as the DGP from January 1, to February 28, 2014.\n\nThe BJP questioned Mr. Ahmed\u2019s appointment and said he was chosen after \u201csuperseding 15 senior officers\u201d and it reflected the \u201cvote-bank\u201d politics of the Akhilesh Yadav government. The SP relies heavily on Muslim votes, in addition to its core Yadav support.\n\nIn the race for the top post, Mr. Ahmed is said to have beaten many senior officers, including DG CB-CID Praveen Singh Verma and DGP Police Recruitment Board V.K Gupta. An M.A in history, Mr. Ahmed has received the President\u2019s police medal for his services. In 2000, he was promoted to the rank of a DIG, while in 2005 he was appointed as an IG.",
