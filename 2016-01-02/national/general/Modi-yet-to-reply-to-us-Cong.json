    "text": "Chidambaram says party not blocking legislation, has helped pass Bills\n\nThe former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Friday rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s charge that the Congress was blocking legislation and had wilfully blocked the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill.\n\n\u201cLet me remind everyone that we have cooperated with the government in passing 67 Bills in the Lok Sabha and 45 in the Rajya Sabha during the past 19 months,\u201d he told a press conference here.\n\nHarking back to the meeting between Mr. Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the first week of December to find a way out of the GST deadlock, Mr. Chidambaram said that the Prime Minister heard out the three main objections the Opposition had on the GST and then gave them his word that he would \u201cget back\u201d to them.\n\n\u201cThat is almost a month ago. We have not yet received the written response of the government or the revised formulations of the government on the three principal objections. So, the ball is entirely in the government\u2019s court. It is for them to come back to us and tell us whether they are accepting our objections, whether they are revising the formula, whether they are amending the particular section,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also accused the ruling BJP was mismanaging the economy, for which he relied on the government\u2019s most recent analysis that suggests \u201cprivate investment and export \u2014 two of the four drivers of demand \u2014 are languishing.\u201d Mr. Chidambaram urged a caution on corporate sheets being \u201cstressed\u201d and net sales falling by \u201c5.3 percent\u201d and profit after tax running \u201cflat\u201d. Non-food credit growth at 8.3 percent, he said, is the \u201cslowest in 20 years\u201d, which means the investment sentiment has become weak. Taking a dig at the government\u2019s foreign policy, Mr. Chidambaram said the country \u201cseems to have lost the goodwill of all concerned \u2014the government of Nepal, the Madhesi parties and the people of Nepal.\u201d\n\n\u201cRhetoric, U-turns, and impulsive steps do not make a coherent foreign policy,\u201d he said.",
