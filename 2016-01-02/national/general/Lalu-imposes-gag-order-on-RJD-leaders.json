    "text": "With the continuing slugfest threatening to snowball into a rift between the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, forming the government in Bihar, RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Friday asked his party leaders not to make any controversial remark as the government has been working \u201cwell and fine.\u201d His remarks came three days after Mr. Prasad pointed to the deteriorating law and order in the State.\n\n\u201cThe party spokespersons and leaders should refrain from making any controversial statement as it will affect the interests of the party. Some leaders make controversial comments to increase their TRPs. Such leaders and spokespersons should take permission from the leadership before making any statement,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.\n\nHe denied any rift in the alliance. \u201cThe Mahagathbandhan [the Grand Alliance] government is working well and fine. We\u2019ve to fulfil our promises to the people,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, after a spate of killings of engineers over extortion demands, the RJD chief expressed dismay at the law and order situation. \u201cThe Nitish Kumar government must be more vigilant, and if anyone receives any extortion call, please call me and I\u2019ll ensure speedy action,\u201d he told journalists. JD(U) leaders were upset. They said no one could question Chief Minister Nitish Kumar\u2019s commitment to law and order. The Opposition BJP took a dig at the ruling alliance, calling Mr. Prasad the \u201csuper CM.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was responsible for law and order. \u201cNitish Kumar is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and is responsible for anything that happens in the State. He should take stern measures to prevent law and order deteriorating further,\u201d he said. \u201cThe RJD is sitting in the back seat. The man at the wheel is responsible for the safe driving of the vehicle,\u201d he replied, when reminded that the RJD is a part of the ruling coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress, the third partner in the coalition, backed Mr. Nitish Kumar.\n\n\u201cLaw and order has always been the USP of Mr. Nitish Kumar for which he has won praise across the country. Some criminal incidents have taken place, and the Chief Minister is looking into them. He will handle them effectively,\u201d Pradesh Congress Committee president and Education Minister Ashok Chaudhury said.",
