Two choppers will be deployed to ferry passengers.\n\nParaag Jaiin Nainuttia, Managing Director of MTDC, said: \u201cMumbai has an amazing skyline. There are many tourists\u2019 spots which look outstanding from the sky. The idea is to provide an enthralling experience to the tourists and boost potential tourism in the State.\u201d\n\nMr. Nainuttia said though initially the chopper rides will be restricted to Mumbai, MTDC will gradually expand to other popular tourist locations like Matheran, Ajanta-Ellora in Aurangabad, Murud-Janjira and other Konkan beaches, and the Tadoba-Andheri wildlife reserve near Nagpur.\n\nThis is the second time MTDC has explored aerial views to boost tourism. Earlier in October 2013, MTDC had launched the hot air balloon safari during the tourist season in Lonavala.",
