    "text": "As researchers across the globe zoom in on the trillions of microorganisms thriving inside the human gut to understand their role in health, a group of Indian scientists has mapped the gut bacteria of 15 ethnic tribes of the country. The effort will promote the development of personalised medicines and designer diets to suit changing lifestyles.\n\nThe research, which tracked 193 healthy individuals from tribes in Assam, Manipur, Sikkim and Telangana, was published in the December edition of Nature Scientific Reports . The study also highlights the similarity of Gut Bacterial Profile (GBP) of these communities with the profiles of the Mongoloid population of Mongolia.\n\n\u201cWith rapid economic development coupled with modernisation of lifestyle, the tribal population of India may eventually undergo alteration in GBP and it is important to know the profile of these microorganisms to prepare necessary strategies for action,\u201d Mojibur R. Khan, group leader of the study, said.\n\nMr. Khan said that as many as 593 bacterial varieties were detected in the profiles and Sikkim tribes showed a \u201chigher abundance\u201d of probiotic bacterial varieties like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus as they consume more dairy products, including curd.\n\n\u201cWhen compared with the worldwide data on gut bacteria, the Indian tribal population had similarity with the Mongoloid population of Mongolia. This means either the genetic similarity or the geographical settings have resulted in the particular food habits (such as fermented foods) and resulting gut bacterial profile,\u201d Mr. Khan said \u2014 IANS\n\nSikkim tribes showed a \u201chigher abundance\u201d of probiotic bacteria, said the study",
