Jaishankar.\n\nMr. Jaishankar was asked searching questions for more than two hours by senior members of the committee who wanted to know why India failed to anticipate the crisis in Nepal which has taken a heavy toll on ties.\n\nDuring the meeting, a member asked Mr. Jaishankar why the government did not focus on internal developments in Nepal during the summer when discussions on the Constitution were taking place in Kathmandu. The MPs asked Mr. Jaishankar about his personal trip to Kathmandu of September 18 which was described as too late to prevent the promulgation of the Constitution which triggered the internal crisis between the government in Kathmandu and the protesting Madhesi citizens in Nepal.\n\nThey asked Mr. Jaishankar about steps the government had taken to dispel Nepal\u2019s perception that the blockade called by the Madhesi protesters had indirect Indian support.\n\nAnother MP present at the meeting told The Hindu that the December 25 agreement between Nepal and China establishing secure energy links would reduce the age-old synergy between the Indian and Nepali economies. Nepal\u2019s Foreign Minister Kamal Thapa who signed the agreement in Beijing also announced on returning to Kathmandu that Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, breaking with an unwritten convention, will visit Beijing in his first trip abroad since taking over in October.\n\n\u201cIndia did not have its eye on the ball and was caught by surprise with the developments in Nepal,\u201d said an MP. \u201cEven the External Affairs Minister had conceded that India did not have details of the Nepal Constitution in advance,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nMembers who attended the briefing by Mr. Jaishankar said that Nepal was fast emerging as a vehicle for China\u2019s growing influence in South Asia and the souring of India\u2019s ties with Nepal would send out a negative message to other members of the South Asian region. \u201cWe have told the Foreign Secretary that 2016 will test Prime Minister\u2019s \u201cNeighbourhood First\u201d policy which was meant to prevent India\u2019s rivals from getting a foothold in South Asia,\u201d said another MP underlining that India\u2019s inability to prevent growing Chinese influence in Nepal would translate into a landmark diplomatic setback.",
