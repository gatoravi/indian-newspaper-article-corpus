    "text": "Since the reconstitution of the CBFC in January 2014, Mr. Nihalani and other members handpicked by the BJP government have been locked in battles over the process of certifying films. The move by the government appears to suggest that an initiative is under way not only to educate the chairperson but also the Board he presides on the finer aspects of film certification.\n\nMr. Benegal said he was asked by the Ministry two days ago if he would head a panel to review the process of certification. The previous UPA government too had undertaken the exercise of setting up a panel under the former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Mukul Mudgal, not only to recommend good certification processes but also to revamp the CBFC and the nine regional boards that come under it. Asked if he has been asked by the government to reinvent the wheel, Mr. Benegal said the wheel had to be invented again and again as there was no such thing as Ten Commandments for films.",
