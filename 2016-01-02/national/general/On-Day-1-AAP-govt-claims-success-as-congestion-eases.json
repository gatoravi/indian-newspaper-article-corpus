    "text": "Both the government and the traffic police seemed to be more in favour of generating awareness of the core objectives of the scheme, instead of presiding over relentless prosecution of violators on the first day of the experiment.\n\nAs a result, the number of fines remained at a measly 145, thus making these directly proportional to the visibly lower volume of the traffic overall.\n\nWhile crediting the Delhi residents for better compliance reflected in the numbers, senior Delhi Police officers admitted that the focus was more on creating awareness and such instructions were passed on to the personnel on the field.\n\nThe enforcement teams were seen acting as per the instruction, allowing some of the even-numbered cars to go with a simple warning and educating them on the initiative.\n\nDelhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi and his Special Commissioner (Traffic) Muktesh Chander said they were happy with the response from Delhiites.\n\nThis is the most significant policy decision to be formulated by any government in the country since the large-scale conversion of State government-run public transport to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in 2002 on the order of the Supreme Court.\n\nDelhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai took to Twitter to express gratitude to all residents. \u201cMany thanks to the Delhiites who embraced the Odd Even concept to make Delhi pollution-free this New Year...Thankful to Delhi Police, Transport Department, Civil Defence and the media for making Odd Even a success.\u201d\n\nDelhi Police Commissioner says he is happy with the response from Delhiites.",
