    "text": "\u201cWas giving final touches to the report... That [purity of the game] still remains the theme,\u201d Justice Lodha said. He said there has been a lot of \u201cspeculation\u201d about the report in the media.\n\nThe report culminates the panel\u2019s exhaustive investigations into how the game is run in the country and what could be done to ensure that transparency and accountability is the rule and not the exception in the administration of cricket in India.\n\nThe committee would also present a second report on the alleged role of former IPL COO Sundar Raman in the 2013 IPL betting case.\n\nThe reports may subsequently come up for hearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur, which had set up the committee while barring BCCI officials from enjoying commercial interests in the game.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu early last year, shortly after he was appointed committee chairperson, Justice Lodha had expressed his firm commitment to cricket in its pristine form. \u201cWe [the committee] know there is huge public expectation resting on us. We will ensure the game is played in its best spirits. We will do our best,\u201d Justice Lodha said.\n\nThe report on Monday is expected to reveal a mechanism to deal with conflict of interest situations, recommend measures to streamline BCCI elections, fix eligibility of candidates and criteria for disqualification and any other recommendations it sees fit in the BCCI functioning.\n\n\u201cWe know there is huge public expectation resting on us\u201d",
