    "text": "Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday that the \u201cfamily values\u201d of Indian Muslims played a crucial role in preventing Indian Muslim youth from supporting the Islamic State\u2019s ideology.\n\nAt a programme organised here by Adamya Chetana, a service organisation promoted by Union Minister Ananth Kumar\u2019s wife Tejaswini, Mr. Singh said such were the high family values of Indian Muslims that they were discouraging their youth from backing the IS if they showed any interest in it. He praised the community for taking measures to prevent the youth from falling prey to the IS ideology. This was the reason the IS did not have much support in India, unlike other countries where the number of its supporters was increasing.\n\n\u201cThis is entirely due to the family values of India Muslims,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis is not a small thing.\u201d Mr. Singh said the government would not only fight terrorism and Maoism but also fundamentalism. All efforts would be made to secure the people of the country from these threats. He expressed concern over the \u201ccrisis of credibility\u201d in Indian politics and asked politicians to ensure that they walked the talk by preventing any gap between their words and deeds.\n\nISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar, DRDO Director-General K. Tamil Mani, Bharat Electronics Limited Chairman S.K. Sharma, AICTE Chairman Anil Sahasrabuddhe and others were felicitated.",
