    "text": "Twitter reverses ban on Politwoops\n\nTwitter has reversed its controversial decision to ban popular tool Politwoops that archived politicians\u2019 deleted social media updates to bring more transparency to public dialogue.\n\nPolitwoops is the only comprehensive collection of deleted tweets by politicians that offers a window into what they hoped you did not see. New CEO Jack Dorsey in October 2015 had spoken about Twitter\u2019s responsibilities to developers and users in the areas of government transparency.\n\nIn a post on Thursday, Colin Crowell, Vice-President for global public policy at Twitter, wrote that the company is pleased to announce an agreement with the Sunlight Foundation and the Open State Foundation around Politwoops. Politwoops is supposed to be accessible in the \u201ccoming days and weeks\u201d, according to the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation.\n\n\u201cPolitwoops is an important tool for holding our public officials, including candidates and elected or appointed public officials, accountable for the statements they make.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that we have been able to reach an agreement with Twitter to bring it back online both in the US and internationally,\u201d said Jenn Topper of Sunlight Foundation.\n\nThis agreement is great news for those who believe that the world needs more transparency.\n\n\u201cOur next step is now to continue and expand our work to enable the public to hold public officials accountable for their public statements,\u201d added Arjan El Fassed, director of watchdog group Open State Foundation that launched Politwoops in more than 30 countries since 2010. \u2014 IANS",
