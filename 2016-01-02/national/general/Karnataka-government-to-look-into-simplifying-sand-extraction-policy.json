    "text": "Minister for Mines and Geology Vinay Kulkarni said steps will be taken to simplify the sand extraction policy and the procedure for issuing permits for sand transportation.\n\nHe told presspersons in Karwar on Friday that there was confusion in the implementation of the sand policy. \u201cThe Public Works Department is monitoring sand extraction and transportation in all districts except in a few coastal ones. The district administration, the PWD, the Police Department and others are required to work in coordination to effectively implement the sand mining policy,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kulkarni clarified that at present, online permit was being given to only those trucks with required permits and in coastal districts where traditional sand mining is being allowed, he said.\n\nTo a query, he said several people had approached the government seeking permits for transportation of sand via tractors, tempo, bullock carts and other small vehicles. And considering the needs of the general public, the government would consider permitting sand transportation through small vehicles, he said.\n\nRegarding the ban on laterite stone mining, Mr. Kulkarni said since laterite stone mining comes under mining, people are facing problems in the district. He said there are several hurdles to permit laterite stone mining.\n\n\u201cThe issue of removing laterite stone from the list of mining minerals, and permitting its mining on payment of requisite fee was being looked into. Soon, a decision on it will be taken after holding a dialogue with miners and officials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Govt. will consider permitting sand transportation through small vehicles\u2019",
