Incidentally, the Centre had already approved the use of this model for redeveloping 400 railway stations.\n\n\u201cUnsolicited proposals (\u201cSwiss Challenge\u201d) may be actively discouraged as they bring information asymmetries in the procurement process and result in lack of transparency and in the fair and equal treatment of potential bidders in the procurement process,\u201d according to the panel\u2019s report.\n\nRoad Transport and Highway Ministry officials, involved in formulating a blueprint for developing several expressways through the Swiss Challenge mode, said the contract would be awarded in a fair manner.\n\n\u201cThe process is pretty fair. A proposal, in the form of a detailed project report (DPR), to develop a proposed expressway project will be uploaded on our website. We will invite bids and to avoid unsolicited proposals, the bidders can propose project cost of not less than 10 per cent of the cost mentioned in the DPR,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe original proposer will get the right of first refusal in such cases and the cost of the DPR will be covered by the agency which bags the contract, the source said.\n\nIndia plans to build 18,637 km expressways in a phased manner by 2022 under an official Master Plan for the National Expressway Network.\n\nAn express highway is a controlled-access highway, generally six-lane or more, where entrance and exit are controlled by the use of slip roads. Under the \u2018Swiss Challenge\u2019 model, any bidder can offer to improve upon a project proposal submitted by another player.\n\nThe Union government has identified building 16 greenfield expressways at present. However, some of the projects put on priority such as the 135-km long Eastern Peripheral Expressway, the 66-km Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the 400-km Vadodara-Mumbai Expressway, are not being bid using the \u2018Swiss Challenge\u2019 route.\n\nMinister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Pon Radhakrishnan, had admitted in the Lok Sabha on December 17 that response to PPP projects had been relatively lower due to several factors.",
