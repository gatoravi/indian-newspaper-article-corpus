    "text": "A majority of students still look at company brands before taking up jobs, to improve their resume\n\nBengaluru may be India\u2019s start-up capital, but a majority of students from the city\u2019s engineering colleges, rearing to cut their teeth on new technologies and disruptive business models, are wary of joining lesser-known start-ups. This, despite the fact that the city is home to thousands of start-ups in various stages of growth.\n\nN.V.R. Naidu, principal of M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT), said this placement season, only 20 per cent of the college students were willing to join start-ups. \u201cA majority of them still look at the brand of the company. Moreover, there is a lot of competition in the start-up ecosystem and people do not know whether they will survive or not, which is why they tend to play it safe,\u201d he said.\n\nPressure from family and peers, and the volatile job market are also strong factors. If at all they join a start-up, it\u2019s usually well-known companies like Flipkart and Snapdeal.\n\nSelva Priyanka, a final-year computer science engineering student at MSRIT, said she accepted a job offer with a multinational company as it was a more stable job with flexible leave options and opportunities to travel overseas. \u201cAt the beginning of our career, we like to work with big brands as it looks good on our resume,\u201d she said.\n\nMany colleges are trying to change this mindset. Mahesh N., placement director, CMR Institute of Technology, said although their institute has launched career-guidance sessions to hone entrepreneurship skills, about 30 per cent of their students were willing to join start-ups. \u201cMost start-ups want to recruit students immediately, even when they are in the final semester.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom. D. Jawahar, CEO, PES University, where 103 companies came for placements, said none of the students is shying away from start-ups as the rewards were higher. \u201cStudents whose domain knowledge is good and who are confident of themselves tend to take the risk and opt to work for their start-ups.\u201d",
