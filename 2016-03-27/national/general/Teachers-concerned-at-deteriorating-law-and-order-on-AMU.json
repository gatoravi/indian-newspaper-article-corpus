Mustafa Zaidi, secretary of the Aligarh Muslim University Teachers Association, said a resolution passed unanimously by the executive committee had highlighted two recent incidents.\n\n\u201cOne, the condemnable incident of firing, that resulted in the reportedly total loss of vision with over hundred pellets in the brain of a brilliant M.Tech. student Kaleem Ahmad, who had successfully competed in the Railway Engineering Services in North India and was about to join, is beyond horror,\u201d said the teachers.\n\n\u201cThe second incident of the attempted abduction of a university student (reportedly a case of mistaken identity) by police within the campus also shows the extremely sorry state of relations between the civil administration and the University,\u201d they said.\u201cThe broad daylight murder in September 2015 of another student Alamgir for which we all demanded a CBI enquiry, remains unsolved.\u201d\n\nThe executive committee said it condemns these and similar incidents and is forced to question all claims of excellence by AMU when the lives, liberty, security of the students is at stake. -- IANSss",
