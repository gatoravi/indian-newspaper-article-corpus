The phenomenon has evoked concern among the public as well as environmentalists.\n\nThe sighting of a leopard at Angamoozhy on several occasions, especially during night, has left the villagers panicky. The other day, a forest patrol team spotted the animal jumping across the Angamoozhy-Plappally road right in front of their vehicle.\n\nSubsequently, the Forest Department has installed a camera trap in the village to locate the animal, while a cage is being arranged to capture it.\n\nKing cobras\n\nThe sighting of king cobras in residential areas along the forest boundary is another cause of concern among villagers. The patrol team recently caught some giant king cobras from the Angamoozhy-Plappally-Palathadiyar area with the help of snake catcher Vava Suresh. The reptiles were later released into the forest interiors.\n\nThere have also been reports of wild elephants, wild boars, and bison straying into human habitations and destroying crops.\n\nEnvironmentalist Dr. Thomas P. Thomas said wild animals were straying into human habitations in search of water and food, as almost all streams and ponds in the forest had dried up.\n\nClimate change and harsh summer has forced animals into human habitations",
