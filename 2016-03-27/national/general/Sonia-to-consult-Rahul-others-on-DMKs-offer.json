The meeting is likely to happen early next week, in which Tamil Nadu PCC chief E.V.K.S. Elangovan will also participate.\n\nA senior Congress leader said that if the DMK wouldn\u2019t offer around 40 seats, the party would prefer to fight alone. \u201cWe are facing a lot of pressure from our workers,\u201d the leader said. \u201cThey are demanding at least 60 seats but we will be happy with anything between 40 and 45 seats.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , S.V. Ramani, a senior Congress leader from Chennai who currently oversees the party\u2019s media cell in Delhi, said the DMK should not decide on Congress party\u2019s seat share by weighing its performance (4 seats out of 63) in the previous assembly elections. In the 2011 elections, the DMK won only 23 of the 127 seats it contested. \u201cTheir [DMK\u2019s] performance was equally bad. So they should not use go by the logic of drawing comparisons with previous elections,\u201d Mr. Ramani added.",
