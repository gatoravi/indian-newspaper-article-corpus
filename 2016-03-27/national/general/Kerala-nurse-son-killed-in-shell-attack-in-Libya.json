They, along with a few others in the same complex, were killed when a shell reportedly fell into their apartment during an air strike.\n\nMs. Sunu\u2019s husband Vipin Kumar was not in their apartment at the time.\n\nVipin Kumar of Vandematharam Thulaseebhavan, Veliyannur, near Kuravilangad, and his family were staying at the four-storeyed office quarters of the hospital. The attack occurred around 7.30 p.m. on Friday, according to reports reaching here.\n\nConflicting reports\n\nHowever, their distraught kin say they have been getting conflicting information on how they died \u201cThe first bit of information came early Saturday morning,\u201d said Thulasidharan, Vipin Kumar\u2019s elder brother. \u201cWe were initially told that it was a missile attack. Then they said it was a shell attack. Later on Saturday, Vipin\u2019s friends in Libya called us from there to say that they died when some explosives where hurled during a fight between two group of Libyans staying in the same apartment,\u201d said Mr. Thulasedharan, who is a small farmer and also works on the side in a local tea shop.\n\nMr. Thulasidharan said that Vipin\u2019s friends told him that he had gone out of the apartment to a friend\u2019s flat nearby on Friday, only to hear the explosion in his flat a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s last WhatsApp message came at about 3 p.m. on Friday, and it said they were enjoying the weekly holiday. He had gone to a flat where his friends stay, about 12 km from his apartment,\u201d Mr. Thulasidharan said. Mr. Vipin Kumar, he said, was in a state of shock, and had not contacted the family afterwards.\n\nVipin, a qualified male nurse, had gone to Libya in 2010 to join the Zawiya Medical Centre. He came back in 2012, married Sunu, a nurse herself, and then went back. His wife joined him in January 2013 after she too managed a job in the same hospital. Their son was born in the Sabratha. \u201cThey celebrated the child\u2019s first birthday in Libya. We were all eagerly waiting to have him with us here for his second birthday on May 2,\u201d Mr. Thulaseedharan said.\n\nBodies sent for\n\npost-mortem\n\nAccording to Mr. Thulasidharan, the bodies were being taken to a hospital in Tripoli for post-mortem. \u201cWe have been told that the bodies will be brought here within a week,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy\u2019s office informed that it was in touch with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj after the news of the deaths came in.
