The 59-year-old\u2019s newest work is designed to convey the flow of human life through large luminous numbers which work their way down the 490-metre tall International Commerce Centre (ICC), a beacon by night in the centre of the southern Chinese city.\n\nEach separate digit, in various sizes and falling at different speeds, represents the trajectory of different individual lives, and Mr. Miyajima felt Hong Kong was the best place for the exhibit.\n\n\u201cI found this city full of energy, vitality. It was the ideal place to reflect on the questions of life and death,\u201d Mr. Miyajima said.\n\n\u201cThe numbers from nine to one scroll gradually, then comes the darkness, then the countdown starts over. The countdown represents life. Darkness symbolises death. It\u2019s the cycle of life that repeats itself.\u201d\n\nThe artist is in town for Art Basel, which has been exhibiting more than 4,000 artists from over 200 galleries around the world all week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m basically telling the story that life is going on and life and death is happening at this very moment... this very moment is very precious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe are three messages in my artwork: to keep changing, connect with everything and continue forever, and it\u2019s hand-in-hand with Buddhist philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong edition of Art Basel, which also takes place in Basel and Miami, has helped feed the city\u2019s reputation as an art hub for Asia.\n\nMr. Miyajima\u2019s work was co-commissioned by Art Basel and will be displayed intermittently over two hours every evening until the end of April. \u2014 AFP",
