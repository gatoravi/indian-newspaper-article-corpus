Manikumar and C.T. Selvam made the observation while dismissing a public interest litigation petition that sought eviction of shopkeepers who eat beef on the Girivalam (circumambulation) pathway around the Dhandayuthapaniswamy Temple at Palani in Dindigul district.\n\nThe judges said: \u201cClaiming to be a practising lawyer and under the garb of president Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam, K. Gopinath, party-in-person, is before us, seeking for a writ of mandamus.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the Indian Penal Code it is stated that eating non-vegetarian food is an offence. There is no law touching eating habits of any religion and in such a view of the matter, the contention of the petitioner that eating beef is an offence cannot be accepted,\u201d the Bench said.\n\n\u201cHe wants a direction to the respondents (Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department officials) to remove shops run by persons belonging to Islam, and other religions, where they are eating beef insulting the religious faith of the devotees and creating disharmony,\u201d Justices S. Manikumar and C.T. Selvam said in the order.\n\nThough the petitioner had contended that causing discomfort to the devotees by consuming beef on the pathway was a punishable offence, the judges said that he had not produced even a scrap of paper to prove that Muslims had put up shops around the temple.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner has also not substantiated that people belonging to religions other than Hinduism cannot have any shops in the property\u2026 The further contention that by eating non-vegetarian food, they have created discomfort to Hindu devotees is also not substantiated.\u201d\n\n\u2018There is no law\n\nin the country\n\nthat touches upon eating habits\n\nof any religion\u2019",
