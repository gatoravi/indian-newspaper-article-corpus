BJP and PDP are allies PDP is Afzal sympathizer. So now, BJP too is Afzal sympathizer? Mehbooba shatters the confidence of the kashmiris, leaves them like orphans,\u201d the tweets said.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted, \u201cMehbooba ji shud publicly clear her stand on this deal with BJP.\u201d\n\nMs. Mufti met Governor N.N. Vohra on Saturday and staked claim for government formation in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn an open letter to Ms. Mufti, AAP leader Kumar Vishwas asked her to accept as \u201cmistake\u201d her \u201chailing\u201d Guru as a martyr in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have come to know from sources that you have changed your stand on traitor Afzal Guru. According to the terms of the alliance, you now consider him an anti-national and you regret your old stand. It is praiseworthy and we appreciate it,\u201d the letter said.\n\nAlleging that action against Kashmiri students who had raised \u201canti-national\u201d slogans at JNU was stalled owing to Ms. Mufti, the AAP hoped that following government formation in the State, she would arrest them or assist the Centre in doing so.\n\n\u201cYou now consider Kashmir an integral part of India like patriots like us. Please clarify to the media stating that hailing Afzal Guru as a martyr was your mistake and you consider him an anti-national,\u201d it said. \u2014 PTI\n\nAAP begins social media campaign #SpeakUp\n\nMehbooba",
