    "text": "A day after Pakistan claimed to have arrested an Indian spy in Balochistan, Indian officials said they were still awaiting consular access to the man identified as retired naval commander Kulbhushan Yadav in Islamabad.\n\nHowever upping the ante over the issue, Pakistan raised accusations against the Indian external intelligence agency R&AW in Balochistan, which borders Iran, with the visiting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. According to an official statement tweeted by the Military\u2019s ISPR (Inter Services Public Relations), \u201cCOAS (General Raheel Sharif) highlighted challenges being faced by Pak. and discussed involvement of the R&AW in Pak.\u2019s internal affairs especially in Balochistan.\u201d\n\nGood ties with India: Iran\n\nAsked about General Sharif\u2019s comments at a press conference in Islamabad, Iranian President Rouhani denied he had \u201cany discussion on this issue.\u201d \u201cWe had talks about how we can expand Iran-Pakistan ties. Also we have good relations with India. So there is no problem. The problems of this region cannot be solved militarily, and must be solved through talks, like the Iranian nuclear problem was,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said to a question.\n\nThe MEA officials declined to comment on the Pakistani Army Chief\u2019s comment, and whether it was related to the arrest of the Indian national along the Afghan-Pak. border on March 21 for what Pakistan called \u201csubversive activities.\u201d\n\nDocuments released by military officials included an Indian passport under an assumed name and a valid visa from Iran. Mr. Yadav is believed to have been based in Iran. Pakistani officials claimed he was working with R&AW and the Afghan agency NDS, and was \u201cplaced in Chahbahar, Iran in 2003 to work against Pakistan.\u201d",
