But that never stopped me,\u201d Umar Nisar, a Class 10 student, told IANS.\n\nThe Android app he developed can be downloaded from Google Play Store.\n\nHe said he learnt programming all by himself and the idea of developing the app came as he wanted to give voice to the youth in the Stateand also promote Kashmiri culture and language beyond the State\u2019s borders..\n\nNisar, whose father drives a tractor and owns a small apple orchard, said he took eight months to write the code for the online radio, available at www.pannunfm.in. \u201cThis will be an inspiration for youth. It will also be a platform for them to explore their talent. I have invested my own money. But I am short of equipments like microphones and computers.\u201d \u2014 IANS\n\nNisar wants to highlight problems faced by Kashmiri youth and promote the State\u2019s culture",
