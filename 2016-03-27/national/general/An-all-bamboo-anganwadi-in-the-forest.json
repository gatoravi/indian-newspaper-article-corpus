And, that\u2019s exactly what the centre at Periyapatna forest reflects. Built entirely of bamboo, this unique initiative which complies with environment and forest laws, has been constructed by the Mysuru Nirmithi Kendra, with technical assistance from the Centre For Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technologies (CREST), National Institute of Engineering (NIE) in the city.\n\nDeputy Commissioner C. Shikha said it was an innovative solution from the district administration, and the new anganwadi not only has good infrastructure, but it is both child-friendly and very conducive to learning. \u201cLocal tribals were involved in the construction, and using locally available bamboo has made it sustainable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe centre cost Rs. 8.26 lakh, with a mini amphitheatre, restroom for children, and a mini-counselling hall for tribal women. The Integrated Tribal Development Programme funded the project.\n\nManjunath, project director, Nirmithi Kendra, said the centre has been constructed on bamboo-based technology and is just like a conventional building. It can withstand heavy rain and lightning. \u201cIt took nearly four months to build,\u201d he added.\n\nThe district administration is keen to build 11 more such anganwadi centres in Periyapatna and H.D. Kote taluks, and hopes to complete them within the next three months, Mr. Manjunath said. The services of the tribal community will once again be used, Mr. Manjunath said.",
