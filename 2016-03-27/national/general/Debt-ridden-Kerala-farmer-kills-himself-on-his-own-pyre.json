    "text": "Caught between debtors hounding him to repay loans, and the severe crisis in the cardamom farming sector, a 64-year-old farmer at Pooppara in Kerala allegedly prepared his own funeral pyre at his home and jumped into it in the early hours of Saturday, killing himself while his family slept.\n\nThe Santhanpara police said Vattathottil Vijayan was in dire straits. He had been quietly collecting logs and other material for the pyre for the last six months , and had even told his friends that it was for his pyre, the police said.\n\nA three-page suicide note recovered from his home said he had decided to take the extreme step as he was unable to cope with his debts, and no one should be held responsible for his death. In 2012, the price of cardamom was about Rs. 2,000 a kg. In Idukki, the local prices were now between Rs. 500 and Rs. 570, while the market rate for the highest grade of cardamom was around Rs. 740.\n\nHis neighbours said Vijayan, who had eight acres under cardamom cultivation, had taken loans worth about Rs. 15 lakh from local moneylenders and banks. He had also borrowed to pay for his wife\u2019s surgery.\n\nThe police said Vijayan had also mentioned in his suicide note that he had originally planned to kill himself six months ago, but had put it off as his daughter-in-law had given birth to his grandchild then.\n\nVijayan, who neighbours say had been on pilgrimage to various temples, reportedly wrote in the suicide note that he believed his death had been decided by the Gods, and he was under pressure from the moneylenders.\n\nVijayan, with eight acres under cardamom, had taken loans of about Rs. 15 lakh",
