    "text": "In yet another case of suspected \u2018honour\u2019 killing, a man was hacked to death in a bar attached to a liquor outlet owned by the Tasmac in Karur town on Saturday night.\n\nA couple of hours later, a man reportedly called the police to inform that he had committed the murder as the deceased, belonging to another caste, had married his sister, bringing disrepute to the family. He told the police that he would surrender soon.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, Suresh Arockiasamy came to the bar in a Maruti-800 car that had a \u2018Press\u2019 sticker. As he was having a drink, a gang of four arrived on two motorcycles and hacked him with weapons. He suffered grievous injuries and died on the way to the hospital, the sources said.\n\nPolice are checking if there was a CCTV network in the vicinity of the crime scene.\n\nThe incident comes just short of two weeks after the gruesome murder of Shankar, a Dalit, at Udumalpet in Tirupur district.",
