It would be the first step into the inquiry. I would not say a word over it unless I get first hand report. To get to the bottom of the problem you have to look into all aspects,\u201d said Mr Parsekar replying to a question from presspersons at the State Secretariat on Saturday.\n\nHe did not rule out an independent time-bound judicial probe in the matter once he got the report, admitting that such an incident was indeed a matter of concern.\n\nAn anti-illegal mining activist and a panchayat member from Caurem village of south Goa, Ravindra Velip, was allegedly attacked in jail while he was in judicial custody. He was arrested on March 22 along with four other villagers when they stopped truck transport of e-auctioned ore from Fomento mining company. Their grievance was that government was constantly ignoring their demand of running truck transport of iron ore through a local co-operative society and that it was allowing illegal ore transport under the garb of transport of ore at the mine site e-auctioned by the State government under directions of a Supreme Court-appointed committee.",
