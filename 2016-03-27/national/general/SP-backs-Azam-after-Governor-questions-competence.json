    "text": "Samajwadi Party on Saturday came out in full support of beleaguered Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan whose competence was questioned by Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik, alleging communal forces were behind his character assassination.\n\n\u201cCommunal forces wanting to gain political mileage are behind the character assassination of Khan,\u201d SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said in a release, apparently peeved over Mr Naik\u2019s remark.\n\nHis statement, in which he did not name Mr Naik, came a day after the Governor questioned Mr Khan\u2019s abilities as the Parliamentary Affairs Minister while taking strong exception to his comments against him in the Assembly.\n\n\u201cAzam Khan is a competent player of parliamentary politics, impressive orator who effectively answers to the criticism of opposition parties,\u201d Mr Chaudhary said, adding he is committed to secularism and has complete faith in SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cEven opposition leaders praise his parliamentary skills in the House...he has rare oratory skills and it is not right to question his competence and abilities,\u201d Mr Chaudhary said.\n\nPublic life is transparent and Azam Khan\u2019s life is an open book, he said, adding Mr Khan has been in politics since the past several decades and his life has been that of struggles since the days of student politics.\n\n\u201cHe has acquired the present position in politics through hard work and has earned fame at the national level,\u201d Mr Chaudhary said.\n\nThe SP spokesman also said Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has complete faith in Mr Khan, who has successfully managed the \u201cMahakumbh\u201d in Allahabad which was acknowleged all over the world.\n\nMe Chaudhary said politics is based on some ideology and values in which criticisms take place over policies but in the recent times, ideology has taken a back seat and attempts are made at character assassination. \u201cSome people are out to spoil the image of Samajwadi Party fearing its growing popularity and they have been targeting one minister after the other depicting their cheap mentality\u201d, he added.\n\nTaking strong exception to Mr Khan\u2019s comments against him in the Assembly, Mr Ram Naik had questioned his competence as the Parliamentary Affairs Minister and said he would take up the matter with the Chief Minister. The Governor, who went through the CD and script of the remarks made by Mr Khan on the floor of the House during discussions on March 8, wrote to Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey.\n\n\u201cAfter going through the edited and unedited copies it is clear that of the 60-line typed comments of Azam Khan against the Governor, 20 lines have been removed. Removal of 33 per cent lines of Parliamentary Affairs Minister\u2019s statement shows that his language is not in keeping with the dignity, decorum and traditions of the House,\u201d Mr Naik said in the letter. Mr Naik had taken serious note of Mr Khan\u2019s hard-hitting remarks against him in the House and had written to the Speaker the next day asking him to provide the unedited printed copies and audio/video CD. \u2014 PTI",
