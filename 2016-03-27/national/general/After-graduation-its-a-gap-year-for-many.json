    "text": "Work experience with top firms appears to have trumped higher education among students in many of the city\u2019s top degree colleges. Graduates are choosing to work with established firms in their fields before deciding whether to continue with their education. Placement officers and career counsellors said this trend was seen mainly in students vying for a seat in the top B-schools in an attempt to bolster their resumes. \u201cBut now we see it among students who have completed their graduation in pure sciences, humanities as well as commerce,\u201d say counsellors in some of the top city colleges.\n\nSahana Das, head of communication studies department, Mount Carmel College, observed that students took a year off from the rat race to explore what they wanted to do. \u201cHowever, during the gap year, too, students are working or preparing for competitive entrance exams and take time to understand what they want to pursue,\u201d she says.\n\nStudents who take a year off to work or do other things are usually those in streams such as history and English that are not directly industry-oriented.\n\nTanya Chabria, a final year B.A. student who has got into film schools and bagged internships, is contemplating taking a year off from academics. \u201cCollege is really strenuous and taking a year off will help you get a direction but you need to be clear about the kind of break you want to take. I really like film-making and advertising and I want to decide which of the two I should pursue and if I should gain experience first or study first,\u201d she said.\n\nColleges also feel that staying a year off academics will help students understand what they want to specialise in.",
