    "text": "Jackman does a water rescue\n\nActor Hugh Jackman rescued his children and other swimmers from a rip tide, a stretch of turbulent water in the sea, at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nIn a video obtained by a news channel, Jackman could be seen grabbing the arm of a man and pulling him around, as the man held onto the actor\u2019s daughter, reports aceshowbiz.com.\n\nJackman then helped his son Oscar, 15, from the same rip. The Wolverine actor was also seen waving at other swimmers in a bid to attract their attention and get them to come ashore.\n\nLifesavers also launched into action, using boards and jet skis to make several other rescues.\n\nPeter Adam, the man who was grabbed by the actor, told the news channel that he was helping the actor\u2019s daughter at the time. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rescuing me, I was assisting him to get his daughter up to the sandbar. He then grabbed my hand to get us up. He then went to get his son,\u201d Adam said. The North Bondi Surf Lifesaving Club took to Instagram to thank Jackman and the surf lifesavers. \u2014 IANS",
