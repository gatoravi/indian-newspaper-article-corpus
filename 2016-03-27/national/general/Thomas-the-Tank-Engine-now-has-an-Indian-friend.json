Created in 1946 by a British clergyman, Thomas has charmed generations of boys and girls \u2014 especially boys \u2014 by teaching gentle life lessons on the fictional island of Sodor.\n\nBut the property\u2019s old-fashioned sensibility makes some parents angry. In 2014, for instance, an essay attacking the Thomas & Friends series for a lack of diversity, among other things, spread quickly online after publication in The Guardian .\n\nMattel, which bought Hit Entertainment, the owner of Thomas & Friends, for $680 million in 2012, lists about 100 characters on the brand\u2019s official website. The vast majority are male and apparently white.\n\nAt the same time, Mattel has been eager to capitalize on its investment by finding ways to make the franchise more popular in fast-growing markets around the world. In an expansion two years in the making, Mattel is giving Thomas 14 new friends, with many coming from countries such as India, Brazil, China and Mexico. Four are female trains.\n\nThe characters will be introduced in a DVD movie called The Great Race that is scheduled for staggered global release starting in August; related merchandise will jointly arrive worldwide in stores. Consumers are demanding more diversity \u2014 just ask the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \u2014 and preschool entertainment is no exception.\n\nTo go with quaint stalwarts like Winnie the Pooh, Disney has introduced series like Doc McStuffins , about a creative little girl who happens to be black; Disney will soon introduce a Latina princess, a first for the company.\n\nHere is a closer look at some of Thomas\u2019 new friends.\n\nRaul of Brazil\n\nAttributes, according to Mattel materials: \u201cfeisty,\u201d \u201cstrong and agile.\u201d\n\nVincent D\u2019Alleva, who oversees Thomas & Friends for Mattel, said in a phone interview that The Great Race movie was made with this summer\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in mind.\n\nCompetitors from different countries coming together as one was a way to make Thomas more culturally aware. \u201cThis story is a way to help him understand that there is a bigger world out there,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alleva said.\n\nYong Bao of China\n\nAttributes: \u201cdriven to achieve and make progress.\u201d\n\nMost of the existing locomotives have names that are basic (Edward, Emily, Sam) or sound British (Fergus, Duncan, Bertie). So Yong Bao stands out right away. China has become a crucial growth market for the franchise.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, we weren\u2019t even in China,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alleva said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the second-largest territory for us,\u201d behind the United States, with Britain falling to third.\n\nAshima of India\n\nAttributes: \u201cshows no fear,\u201d \u201chappy to help out.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is the first one who can take on Thomas in terms of being the fastest engine,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alleva said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a romance story because, well, that\u2019s not something for our target audience. But it is about developing a relationship. How does Thomas develop a relationship with someone who looks very different from him and in some cases can do things better than he can?\u201d\n\nCarlos of Mexico\n\nAttributes: \u201cproud,\u201d \u201calways wearing a smile.\u201d\n\nIf Carlos seems to have a Frida Kahlo-style unibrow, that may be intentional. Mattel went to great lengths, Mr. D\u2019Alleva said, to make sure each new character had a colour palette and personality reflective of a particular country\u2019s culture.\n\nWherever possible, each locomotive was designed after a train from the country it represents. Carlos is patterned after a Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico locomotive known as No. 903. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
