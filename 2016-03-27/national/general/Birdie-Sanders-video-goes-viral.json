The Democratic candidate smiled and the audience of more than 10,000 went wild when a tiny bird joined Mr. Sanders at the podium.\n\nWithout missing a beat, the Vermont senator said even though it didn\u2019t look like a dove, it must have been one that came to ask for world peace.\n\n\u201cI think there may be some symbolism in this,\u201d said an amused Mr. Sanders, after the bird spent a few moments with him before flying off. \u201cI know it doesn't look like it, but that bird is really a dove asking us for world peace\u2026 No more wars!\u201d The video of Sanders and his feathered friend has gone viral on social media, with the hashtag \u2018BirdieSanders\u2019. \u2014 AP",
