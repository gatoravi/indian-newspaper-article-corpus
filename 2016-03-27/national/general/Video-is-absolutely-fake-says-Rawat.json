The reputation of the journalist is not hidden from anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Congress\u2019s central leadership has come out in support of the Chief Minister. AICC general secretary in charge of the media Randeep Singh Surjewala said: \u201cAfter unsuccessfully deploying money power and having faced disappointment from the High Court yesterday [Friday], the BJP has come out with this so-called sting operation. It doesn\u2019t matter; the truth will still win.\u201d\n\nRawat must resign: BJP\n\nMeanwhile, Uttarakhand BJP president Ajay Bhatt, who is camping here with 26 other BJP MLAs, has said Mr. Rawat\u2019s \u201cfascist rule\u201d has led to political instability in the State.\n\n\u201cImagine being an MLA of the Chief Minister\u2019s party and unable to speak to him without approval from some middlemen. It is stifling,\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\nChief Minister questions the credibility of the journalist behind the sting operation",
