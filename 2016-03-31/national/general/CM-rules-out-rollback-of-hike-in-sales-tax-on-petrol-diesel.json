However, the State government did not raise the taxes on diesel and petrol in the middle of the year, and the benefits had been passed on to consumers, he said.\n\nHe said continuous fall in the crude oil prices had reduced commercial tax collection by Rs. 800 crore in 2015\u201316. The hike in fuel prices would not hit hard the poor and common people, he claimed.\n\nCM rules out waiver for crop loans",
