The Uttarakhand Governor had given Chief Minister [Harish] Rawat time till March 28 to prove his majority on the floor of the House, but what was achieved by imposing President\u2019s Rule a day before the floor test?\u201d the editorial questioned.\n\nTitled Lokshahicha Mrityu Ki Hatya?

But a sting video emerged accusing the CM of indulging in horse trading, questioning his morality, and the democratically elected government was strangled to death.\u201d Drawing parallels between the dismissal of the Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the editorial said the political grapevine says Congress governments in Himachal Pradesh and Manipur will be the next targets.\n\nEditorial says Cong governments in Himachal Pradesh and Manipur will be the next targets",
