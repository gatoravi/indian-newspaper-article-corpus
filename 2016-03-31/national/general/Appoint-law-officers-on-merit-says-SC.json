Thakur and Justice Kurian Joseph said it is \u201chigh time\u201d fair, transparent and objective criteria based on merit were adopted for the appointment of law officers.\n\n\u201cAppointments are made not because they are required but because they come in handy for political aggrandisement, appeasement or personal benevolence of those in power towards those appointed.\n\n\u201cThe dangers of such an uncanalised and unregulated system of appointment, it is evident, are multi-dimensional, resulting in erosion of the rule of law, public faith in the fairness of the system and injury to public interest and administration of justice,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur, who authored the verdict for the Bench, observed.",
