There was a sharp decline in hiring of contract labour in 2015.\n\nContractual jobs declined by 21,000 in January-September 2015 against an increase of 1.20 lakh in the corresponding period of 2014. Direct employment rose by 1.76 lakh in 2015 compared to an increase of 1.84 lakh in 2014.\n\nThe Labour Bureau, under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, started conducting this quarterly survey after the 2008-09 global crisis to gauge its impact on employment in eight crucial sectors \u2014 textiles, leather, metal, automobiles, gems and jewellery, transport, information technology (IT) and handloom.\n\nIndian Staffing Federation president Rituparna Chakraborty expressed surprise at these numbers.\n\n\u201cThe staffing industry is going at a healthy 18-20 per cent. The data released by the Labour Bureau doesn\u2019t give a comprehensive landscape of the job growth in the country as it doesn\u2019t capture many sectors,\u201d she told The Hindu .",
