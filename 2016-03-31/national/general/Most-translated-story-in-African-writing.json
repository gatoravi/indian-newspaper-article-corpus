    "text": "A fable by Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o titled The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright is now available in over 30 languages\n\nA fable by the major Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o has been translated into over 30 languages, making it \u201cthe single most translated short story in the history of African writing\u201d, according to its publisher.\n\nPan-African writers\u2019 collective Jalada Africa released its latest issue, focusing on translation, last week. It includes Ngugi\u2019s story Ituka Ra Mrngar: Kana Kra Gtmaga And Mathi Marngi , which the award-winning author originally wrote in Kikuyu, a Kenyan language, and then translated himself into English as The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright .\n\nThe fable tells the story of how \u201ca long time ago humans used to walk on legs and arms, just like all the other four limbed creatures\u201d, but how \u201ctheir rhythm and seamless coordination made the other parts [of the body] green with envy\u201d, and \u201cthey started plotting against the two pairs\u201d.\n\nJalada says it worked with translators of \u201call levels of experience, from a recent high school graduate to distinguished professors\u201d, to pull together its huge range of translations of Ngugi\u2019s story , which is available in Amharic, Dholuo, Kamba, Lwisukha (Luhya), Kipsigis, Kinyarwanda, French, Arabic, Luganda, Kiswahili, Afrikaans, Hausa, Meru, Lingala, IsiZulu, Igbo, Ibibio, isiNdebele, XiTsonga, Nandi (Kalenjin), Rukiga, Bamanankan, Lugbara, Lubukusu, Kimaragoli, Giriama, Sheng, Ewe, and Naija Langwej. It is now looking for writers and volunteers to volunteer more translations.\n\nEmpowering readers\n\nNgugi said the project would \u201cempower Africa by making Africans own their resources from languages \u2014 making dreams with our languages \u2014 to other natural resources \u2014 making things with them, consuming some, exchanging some.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe moment we lost our languages was also the moment we lost our bodies, our gold, diamonds, copper, coffee, tea. The moment we accepted (or being made to accept) that we could not do things with our languages was the moment we accepted that we could not make things with our vast resources,\u201d said the novelist and playwright.\n\nJalada is now planning to periodically publish a Translation Issue featuring a previously unpublished story, which it will ask writers and translators to translate into their own African language. Its ultimate goal is to translate each story into 2,000 African languages. \u201cDespite long-running conversations on the need for publishing in indigenous languages on the African continent over the past five decades, writing and translations remain minimal and the little that exists continues to rapidly decline,\u201d said the writers\u2019 collective.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of speakers in African languages and not many writers in African languages. Why? Can this be changed?\u201d\n\nManaging editor Moses Kilolo, in an introduction to the issue, said Ngugi was \u201cuniquely placed to be the first distinguished author and intellectual featured in our periodical Translations Issue\u201d as he \u201chas, for many years, been the most vocal proponent in publishing in African languages\u201d.\n\nKilolo said the story itself was \u201ca reminder that we are one, and that in our togetherness we have the power to transform the future that we hope for ourselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor many of these translations, Jalada was very fortunate to find willing editors with considerable orthographical knowledge of their language\u2019s textual application,\u201d Kilolo writes. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016",
