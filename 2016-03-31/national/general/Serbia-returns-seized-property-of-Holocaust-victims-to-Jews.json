The funds will be spent on education, fighting prejudice and preserving the memory of Holocaust victims, along with supporting survivors, said its president, Ruben Fuks.\n\nLebl is one of the last of Serbia\u2019s Jews who remembers the war. By the spring of 1942, more than 80 per cent of the 33,000 Jews living in Serbia before the war had been killed, and the Nazis declared the country \u201cfree of Jews.\u201d\n\nEven today, there are fewer than a thousand Jews in Serbia. \u201cAfter the war the authorities decided to return the property, but as so many people were killed, there was no one left to take back most of it,\u201d said Lebl. \u201cThe Jewish community has never recovered, because the loss [of human life] was so high.\u201d\n\n\u2018Moral obligation\u2019\n\nPresenting the new law in Parliament, Justice Minister Nikola Selakovic said Serbia had a \"moral obligation\" towards Jews who \u201cdedicated their lives and work to our Serbia.\u201d\n\nHe said the move would also \u201ccontribute to a greater understanding of human rights, which is crucial for fighting and preventing racial and religious discrimination.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
