However, a reliable police source confirmed that all seven jawans belonged to the \u201cnon-combat\u201d staff and were carrying no weapon with them. Mr. Upadhyay confirmed that his men were shot at by Maoists even after the explosion. \u201cThe blast was so powerful that the bodies were thrown 100-150 metres away. Almost all of them might have died in the explosion or would have been on the verge of death. But it is true that Maoists shot two of them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe deceased jawans were identified as Sub-Inspector D. Vijay Raj, constables Pradeep Tirkey, Rupnarayan Das, Devendra Chourasia, Ranjan Dash and Mritunjoy Mukharjee and driver Saindane Nana Usesing. The jawans were going in a single vehicle without any support team or the road opening party.\n\nAsked whether there might have been some lapses on the part of the CRPF men, Chhattisgarh Special DG (Anti-Naxal Operations) D.M. Awasthi told reporters on the Assembly premises that all the CRPF men were in plainclothes. \u201cWe issued instructions a few days ago. We will investigate to find out what went wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nChief Minister Raman Singh said an inquiry would be carried out to determine whether the norms were followed [by CRPF men] or not.",
