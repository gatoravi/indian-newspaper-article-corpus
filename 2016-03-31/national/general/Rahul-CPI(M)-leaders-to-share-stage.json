This is the first time in recent history that the top leaders of the two parties will be sharing the stage in the State.\n\nMr. Gandhi will address three meetings on Saturday and CPI(M) leaders are expected to be seen with him in at least two in Bardhaman district. The rallies will take place in Durgapur city and the Kulti industrial area. There will also be a separate rally led by Mr. Gandhi in Bankura.\n\nConfirming the development, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said at least two of his party colleagues would attend Mr. Gandhi\u2019s rallies.\n\nCPI(M) State Secretariat member Rabin Deb said senior leaders Bansa Gopal Chowdhury and Goranga Chatterjee \u201cwill attend the meeting along with the party candidates\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan released a booklet earlier in the day, explaining the necessity of the Left-Congress tie-up to \u201coust\u201d the Trinamool Congress from power.\n\nIn the booklet, titled Lortey Hobey Eksathey (We shall fight together), Mr. Mannan says the \u201cpolitical situation in Bengal pushed them to forge an alliance\u201d. The success of the \u2018Bihar Model\u2019 where the RJD, the JD(U) and the Congress formed a grand alliance is recalled.",
