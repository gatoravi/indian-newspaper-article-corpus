Mr. Bhadraiah is from the Koya community of Kothapalli village in Chinturu mandal that was recently merged into the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh from Khammam in Telangana.\n\nMr. Bhadraiah, along with Konda Sahadev, a taekwondo coach, will start from Hyderabad on April 7. The expedition is scheduled to conclude on May 23.\n\nThe road to becoming part of a two-member team was not easy for Mr. Bhadraiah.\n\nLast year, he visited the rock-climbing school at Bhuvanagiri in the Nalgonda district of Telangana, and met eight-times Arjuna Award winner and coach B. Sekhar Babu.\n\nThe latter responded favourably to his plea to admit him in a 23-member team. After a training session at Bhuvanagiri fort, Mr. Bhadraiah emerged as one of the two persons selected to climb the Everest. After completing an industrial training programme from Kothagudem College, he worked for the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation plant near Mothugudem on contract basis. \u201cMy parents are farm labour. Our habitations, except for a few colonies, will soon submerge in the Polavaram project\u201d he said.\n\nOn February 21, Mr. Bhadraiah lost all his academic certificates in a fire accident.\n\nK.V.N. Chakradhara Babu, ITDA (Integrated Tribal Development Agency) Project Officer, helped Mr. Bhadraiah get his passport and the financial support for the expedition .\n\nDoodi Bhadraiah will be the first person from Koya community to climb Mt. Everest",
