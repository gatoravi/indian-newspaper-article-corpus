    "text": "Despite the cautionary travel advisory on Jammu and Kashmir by his country, former Australian parliamentarian and ultra-marathon runner Pat Farmer on Wednesday urged tourists across the globe to visit the State for its scenic beauty. Speaking after the culmination of the 4,600-km run, \u2018Spirit of India-Kanyakumari to Kashmir\u2019, Mr. Farmer said: \u201cKashmir Valley has unparalleled beauty, which tourists from all countries should experience by visiting the place at least once in their lifetime.\u201d\n\nWhile planting a Chinar sapling at the world-famous Mughal Garden Nishat in Srinagar, Mr. Farmer said he would ask his friends and family to definitely come to the Calley to enjoy the natural beauty here.\n\nHowever, he has a suggestion for the State tourism sector: \u201cMedical as well as adventure tourism should be the focus to lure more international tourism.\u201d\n\nMr. Farmer\u2019s statement has come as a shot in the arm for the tourism industry as it comes in the backdrop of a negative travel advisory for Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\u201cMr. Farmer\u2019s statement will help in removing the negative travel advisory on J&K. It\u2019s a welcome statement. I hope all negative travel advisories on J&K will re-looked after Mr. Farmer\u2019s marathon culminating in Srinagar,\u201d said a top Tourism Department official.",
