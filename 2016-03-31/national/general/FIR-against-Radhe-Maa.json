The FIR was filed after a Mumbai court ordered the police to do so.\n\nEarlier this year, Asad Patel, an RTI activist, had approached the police and, subsequently, the Metropolitan Magistrate\u2019s court in Andheri seeking an FIR against Ms Kaur. Mr. Patel had come to know that she had carried a \u2018trishul\u2019 on a Jet Airways flight from Aurangabad to Mumbai in violation of rules.",
