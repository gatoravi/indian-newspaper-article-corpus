    "text": "The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday filed a charge sheet against Chhagan, Sameer and Pankaj Bhujbal, as well as 49 others in connection with the money laundering case registered by the agency last year.\n\nThe ED in 2015 registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the Bhujbals in connection with the kickbacks allegedly received by them in exchange for awarding contracts for construction of a regional transport office building in Andheri and a new Maharashtra Sadan building in Delhi. The ED contended in its case that the money received in complaints was routed through companies owned by the family and invested in a real estate venture in Navi Mumbai, which never took off.\n\nThe ED went on to arrest Sameer on February 2 this year and Chhagan on March 14, and both of them are currently in judicial custody.\n\nApart from the Bhujbals, the ED also named corporates like D.B. Realty, Balwa group of companies \u2013 Neelkamal Realtors & Builders Pvt. Ltd., Neelkamal Central Apartment LLP and Kakade Infrastructure.",
