    "text": "On February 9, the Bombay High Court reserved its verdict on a PIL plea that challenges the ban on the entry of women in the sanctum sanctorum of Haji Ali Dargah, a centuries-old Sufi shrine in Mumbai.\n\nThe PIL was filed by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan that states that women have always been allowed at the dargah, but in June 2012, the Dargah Trust restricted the entry of women to the sanctorum.\n\nThe Maharashtra government, in its submission, said equality must rule over tradition and customs, and that the Dargah Trust should only administer, not regulate, tradition.",
