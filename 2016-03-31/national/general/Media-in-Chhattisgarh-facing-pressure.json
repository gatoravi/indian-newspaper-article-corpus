There is a constant battle between security forces and Maoists. Journalists, caught in the middle, are under attack by both the state and non-state actors. Several incidents of attacks on journalists have been reported over the past few months. At least two, according to the reports, were arrested and imprisoned and others threatened and intimidated to a point where they had to leave Bastar fearing for their lives. The residence of at least one journalist, according to the information, was also attacked,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe team came to the conclusion that the media reports of threats to journalists are true. The media in Chhattisgarh is working under tremendous pressure. In Jagdalpur and remote tribal areas, the journalists find it even more difficult to gather and disseminate news. There is pressure from the State administration, especially the police, on journalists to write what they want or not to publish reports that the administration sees as hostile. There is pressure from Maoists as well on the journalists working in the area,\u201d it added.",
