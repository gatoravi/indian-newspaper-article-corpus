Chandrasekhar Rao will launch Telangana\u2019s Information Technology policy on April 4 in the presence of several front ranking leaders of the IT industry, including Infosys co-founder N.R.Narayana Murthy.\n\nIt will be one of most progressive policies, IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao declared, adding the focus is on riding the next wave of growth. Four sub-policies -- Innovation, Rural Technology, Electronics manufacturing and Gaming -- are also to be launched at the same function.\n\nThe Minister, interacting with presspersons after laying the foundation stone for Amazon\u2019s campus at Gachibowli here, said the policy will be in \u201calignment with our thought process\u201d.\n\nWhile the policy on Innovation is intended to support start-ups, the one on Rural Technology is to encourage rural entrepreneurship and promote innovation from villages.\n\nWithout sharing specifics, he said the Chief Minister is expected to make announcements, including in all likelihood on the seed investment fund proposed at the time of setting up of T-Hub incubator for technology start-ups.\n\nThe launch, he said, will see participation of another co-founder of Infosys Mohandas Pai, Intel Managing Director-South Asia Debjani Ghosh, Nasscom leaders B.V.R. Mohan Reddy and R. Chandrasekhar, Microsoft India head Bhaskar Pramanik, Samsung\u2019s vice-president Deepak Bharadwaj and senior officials from the Centre.\n\nCompanies with plans to invest on facilities in the State will also sign MoUs with the government at the function, he said. Noting that the State\u2019s rate of growth in IT exports was better than the country\u2019s, Mr. Rama Rao said whether the Centre provided adequate funding for the ITIR project or not, the State government is keen on taking IT investments beyond Hyderabad. Google, he added, is expected to start work on a large campus in Hyderabad in May or June.\n\nAt the foundation laying programme, Amazon\u2019s senior vice-president David Zapolsky said the e-commerce giant\u2019s proposed campus here will be the largest outside of the US.",
