I figured if his bomb was real I\u2019d nothing lose anyway, so took a chance to get a closer look at it,\u201d Mr. Innes said.\n\nHe was among the 62 people on board an EgyptAir flight from Alexandria to Cairo on Tuesday when Mustafa seized control and threatened to detonate a bomb belt, which was later discovered to be a fake. Mustafa forced the Airbus A320 to land in Larnaca.\n\nMr. Innes said panicking passengers calmed down once the plane landed and Mustafa allowed women and children to leave. Later, Mustafa disembarked and surrendered to the police.\n\nAt a court hearing on Wednesday in Larnaca, a judge ordered Mostafa to be detained for eight days. Mustafa, aged 58, had earlier told police that he diverted the flight to see his Cypriot ex-wife and children.\n\n\u2018Wanted to see wife\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s someone supposed to do when he hasn\u2019t seen his wife and children in 24 years and the Egyptian government won\u2019t let you?\u201d Mostafa told authorities.\n\nPolice told the court that Mustafa \u2014 described by officials as \u201cpsychologically unstable\u201d \u2014 faces possible charges of hijacking, kidnapping, reckless and threatening behaviour, and breaches of the anti-terror law.\n\nEgypt has asked Cyprus to extradite Mustafa. Egypt\u2019s interior ministry said Mustafa had a long criminal record but had finished serving a one-year prison term in March 2015. \u2014 Agencies",
