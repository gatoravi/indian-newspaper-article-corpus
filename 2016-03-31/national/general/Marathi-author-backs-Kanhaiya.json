    "text": "JNU Students\u2019 Union leader Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s much-anticipated visit to Pune next month has drawn support from noted litterateur Shripal Sabnis, who on Wednesday said attempts to ban or proscribe Mr. Kumar\u2019s talk were \u201cutterly unjust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attempt to stifle his [Kanhaiya\u2019s] freedom of speech by banning and cancelling his talk is not proper... despite charges of sedition against him. It is yet to be proved whether he raised anti-national slogans,\u201d said Dr. Sabnis, who is president of the 89th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan.\n\nThe proposed talk and its venue have already seen battle lines being drawn sharply between student outfits belonging to opposing political ideologies, while throwing educational authorities and the police into a tizzy.\n\nIn his statement supporting Mr. Kumar, Dr. Sabnis also said rightwing outfits were attempting to disrupt Kanhaiya\u2019s event in the city.",
