    "text": "As West Bengal prepares to vote in a few days, sex workers in the State despair over the unfulfilled promises made to them by political parties in the previous elections, saying they want \u201cconcrete\u201d measures this time.\n\nThe Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, representing 1.5-lakh sex workers in West Bengal, say they feel cheated because no political party has kept its promise to look into their demands.\n\n\u201cWhenever elections come, political parties make tall promises, but none of them is put in to action. We have been regularly placing a charter of demands for the past several years, but nothing has come out of it,\u201d Bharati Dey, president of All-India Network for Sex Workers and Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), says. Frustrated, the roughly five million sex workers in the country under the network want to exercise the NOTA (none of the above) option during polling to express their disapproval, Ms. Dey says. The national network of sex workers is spread across 16 States.\n\n\u201cWe will send letters to political parties listing our demands and raising issues that concern sex workers and their families,\u201d she says.\n\nCharter of demands\n\nThe demands that the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) has made over the years are pension rights for retired sex workers, removal of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, legalisation of the profession, covering sex workers under labour laws and setting up of a self-regulatory board to stop minors from being forced into the profession. \u2014 PTI\n\nSay none of the political parties has kept the election promises made to them",
