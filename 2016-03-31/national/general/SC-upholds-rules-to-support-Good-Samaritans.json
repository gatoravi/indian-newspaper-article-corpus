    "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Central notification issuing standard operating procedure (SOP) for the protection and examination of \u2018Good Samaritans\u2019 \u2014 those who help road accident victims \u2014 and make it binding on all State governments and authorities.\n\nA Bench led by Justice V. Gopala Gowda endorsed the January 21, 2016 notification issued by the Transport Ministry as a positive signal for a concerted effort to change the public\u2019s attitude of turning away from helping a road accident victim reach critical medical care.\n\nThe court said wide publicity should be given by the Centre and the States about the guidelines.\n\nThe SOP was framed by the government on the orders passed by the Supreme Court on a PIL plea filed by NGO SaveLIFE Foundation in 2012, highlighting the fact that more lives of accident victims can be saved if a law can be made to protect Good Samaritans from legal and procedural hassles at the hands of police and hospitals.\n\nThe Centre issued a series of guidelines on May 12, 2015, to protect Good Samaritans.",
