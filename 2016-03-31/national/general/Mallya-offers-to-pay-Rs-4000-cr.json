    "text": "\u201cThey just want the money taken from the banks to be brought back.\u201d\n\nIn the previous hearing, the banks had faced uncomfortable questions from the court about their decision to grant such huge loans to the industrialist, especially when they admitted that only \u201ca fraction\u201d of Mr. Mallya\u2019s assets were in India.\n\nThe consortium of lenders, which confirmed the receipt of an offer for settlement of dues from Kingfisher Airlines, will meet on Thursday to decide on Mr. Mallya\u2019s offer. Kingfisher Airlines is grounded since October 2012 and Mr. Mallya has been declared as wilful defaulter by banks like the State Bank of India and the United Bank of India. \u201cThe bank along with other consortium members, will examine the same,\u201d State Bank of India, the leader of the lenders\u2019 consortium said in a statement.\n\nThe airline owes a total of about Rs. 9,000 crore, of which Rs. 6,903 crore is the principal.\n\nBankers said since the additional Rs. 2,000 crore is conditional and hence uncertain, they may not be in a position to take a haircut to settle dues.\n\n\u201cNo bank will be in a position to take a haircut,\u201d said a senior banker.",
