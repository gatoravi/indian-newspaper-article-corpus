    "text": "The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday asked the Governor, who is the Chancellor of universities in Karnataka, to file objections to the petition filed by H. Maheshappa, who was recently suspended from the post of Vice-Chancellor of Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belagavi.\n\nJustice Raghvendra S. Chauhan passed the order during the hearing of Mr. Maheshappa\u2019s petition while adjourning further hearing till April 11.\n\nEarlier, counsel for Mr. Maheshappa contended that there is no provision in the VTU Act for placing a Vice-Chancellor under suspension as the provision only allows the Chancellor to remove the VC by following the procedure.\n\nHowever, counsel for the Chancellor defended the suspension, claiming that the Chancellor can\u2019t be a silent spectator after receiving complaints and receipt of enquiry report. The Chancellor had issued order of suspension on March 14.\n\nStayed\n\nThe High Court on Wednesday stayed the appointment of a commission of inquiry against B.R. Ananthan, a former Vice-Chancellor of Rani Channamma University, Belagavi.\n\nJustice A.S. Bopanna passed this interim order on a petition filed by Mr. Ananthan, who claimed that the State government had not power under the Karnataka Universities Act, 2000, to order an inquiry against a retired VC.",
