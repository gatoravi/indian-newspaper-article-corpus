The State government, however, said he died of an illness and because there was no one to care for him.\n\nA report in a local television news channel had said Jago Manjhi, 60, a Mahadalit of Sherpar village under the Bar Bigha police station of Sheikhpura district, died of starvation on Friday. Manjhi lived in a thatched hut with his wife.\n\nRaising the issue in the Assembly, Prem Kumar, Leader of the Opposition, said: \u201cThe government has failed to distribute food grains to the poor and people like Jago Manjhi are dying of starvation\u2026 the government should order a high-level probe.\u201d\n\nLok Janshakti Party chief and Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan told journalists that the Nitish Kumar government had failed to implement the food security programme. \u201cThe programme was launched in the State in a hurry ahead of the Assembly elections last year, but its implementation was tardy,\u201d he said. \u201cOur party demands a judicial probe into the death of Jago Manjhi.\u201d\n\nAnother BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh visited the village and offered help to the victim\u2019s family. \u201cLocal people said he had been unable take his quota of food grain \u2026 the State government has failed to provide food to poor people like Jago Manjhi,\u201d said Mr. Singh. His alliance partner and leader of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) Jitan Ram Manjhi too blamed the Nitish Kumar government for Manjhi\u2019s death.\n\nThe State government denied that Manjhi died of starvation. \u201cAs soon as the news reached us, we sought a report from the district magistrate. His report said Jago Manjhi died not of starvation, but of an illness. He was covered under the government\u2019s Antyodaya Yojna programme and was getting the benefits intended for poor people,\u201d said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. His deputy Tejaswi Yadav said one should not politicise the tragedy. \u201cThe government will look into the incident.\u201d\n\nEarlier, a three-member inquiry team constituted by Sheikhpura district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh said Manjhi\u2019s death was due to liver cirrhosis.",
