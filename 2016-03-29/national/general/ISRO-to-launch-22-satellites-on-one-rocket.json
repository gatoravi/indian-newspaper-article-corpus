    "text": "When the PSLV C34 rocket blasts off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Srikarikota in May this year, it will signal another giant leap for India\u2019s space mission. The trusted launch vehicle will inject 22 satellites into the orbit, a first in the history of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\n\nApart from the Indian remote sensing satellite, Cartosat 2C, which constitutes the primary payload, the rocket will carry on board four micro-satellites weighing 85 to 130 kg each and 17 nano-satellites weighing 4 to 30 kg. As many as 18 satellites are being launched for foreign agencies, including those from the U.S., Canada, Germany, and Indonesia.\n\nTwo of the nano-satellites have been developed by the Pune Engineering College and Sathyabhama University.\n\n\u201cThe PSLV rocket, in its XL version, will be used for the mission,\u201d VSSC Director K. Sivan said here on Monday. \u201cThe injection of so many satellites into orbit increases the complexity of the mission many fold,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIn April 2008, ISRO launched 10 satellites into the orbit using the PSLV C9 rocket.",
