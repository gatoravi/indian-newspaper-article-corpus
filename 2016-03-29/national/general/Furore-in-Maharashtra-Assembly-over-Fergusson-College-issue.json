    "text": "The Opposition stalled the proceedings in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council on Monday, demanding an apology and a statement from Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on the incident in Pune\u2019s Fergusson College and an alleged \u2018purification ceremony\u2019 of Mahad\u2019s historic Chavdar Lake.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil raised the issue of student clashes and the suicide of a farmer outside the Mantralaya through an adjournment motion.\n\n\u201cThe farmer\u2019s death is a clear indication that this government has failed to take measures to resolve agrarian issues. The government should not only make a statement but also apologise for what has happened in Pune and Mahad. Is the government trying to create an atmosphere of communal animosity in the State,\u201d Mr. Vikhe-Patil asked.\n\nAs Congress and NCP MLAs gathered in front of the Speaker\u2019s Chair, both Houses were adjourned for the day.\n\nIn the Legislative Council, Leader of the Opposition Dhananjay Munde criticised the government for attempting to file sedition cases against students for raising Jai Bhim slogans. \u201cIf this is the case, then I will shout Jai Bhim a hundred times,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the \u2018purification\u2019 of Chavdar Lake, Shiv Sena MLA Bharat Gogawale said the ceremony was part of the government\u2019s \u2018Jal Abhiyaan.\u2019 \u201cI was invited as I am the local MLA. Certain anti-social elements are using it to widen rifts in society.\u201d The lake is important in the history of the Dalit rights movement as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had led an agitation against the ban by upper castes on Dalits drinking water from it.\u201d",
