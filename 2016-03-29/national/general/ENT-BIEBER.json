Some, who had paid $2,000 to see him, got even more disappointed when they were greeted with a cardboard cutout of the pop superstar in a backstage room at his Las Vegas show over the weekend, reported Aceshowbiz.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the cutout was put there on purpose or not, but the irate fans vented their frustration on Twitter. \u201cSomeone stop Justin Bieber his lack of respect for his fans right now is making me sick to my stomach... Cardboard cutout for 2K...,\u201d a fan wrote, while another tweeted: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever feeling sad just remember there\u2019s a bunch of people who paid USD 2000 to meet a cardboard cut out of Justin Bieber.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
