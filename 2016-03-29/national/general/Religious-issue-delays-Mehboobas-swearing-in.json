These days are considered auspicious days in the Hindu calendar.\n\n\u201cIt should happen before April 8 only,\u201d said BJP secretary Ashok Kaul.\n\nThe sources said the BJP would do a major reshuffle of portfolios within the party and might induct fresh faces as ministers.\n\nThe party wants to take its time to assess the situation within the party and allot portfolios to new faces, said a party insider.\n\nOn the contrary, the PDP is seeking more time to ensure the BJP brass attends the swearing-in ceremony. Sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is travelling abroad in the first week of April, may not be available for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\n\u201cThe PDP would like top BJP leaders from the Centre to throw their weight behind Ms. Mufti by attending the swearing-in ceremony,\u201d said a PDP leader.",
