    "text": "Pakistan securing its nuclear material: U.S\n\nThe U.S cannot ignore the threat of Islamic State (IS) terrorists laying their hands on nuclear material, a senior official said ahead of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit that will bring together leaders from 51 nations on March 31 and April 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending the summit.\n\nInitiated by President Barack Obama in 2010 to raise the discussions on securing nuclear material to the highest level in the wake of the increasing threat of terrorism, the summit, in its fourth edition, takes place in the shadow of the Brussels attacks that killed 31 people.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-proliferation Thomas Countryman said he would not label a nuclear threat from the IS \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cimminent\u201d, but the U.S could not \u201cignore or take it for granted\u201d.\n\nHowever, \u201cmeasures taken by many countries after the 2010 summit have substantially reduced the risk,\u201d Mr. Countryman said. He said the focus of the NSS would be specifically on securing nuclear material from falling into the hands of terrorists and other general non-proliferation efforts would continue in separate tracks.\n\nPat for Pakistan\n\nPakistan, which has been at the centre of U.S concerns regarding nuclear proliferation to terror groups, got a good conduct certificate from Mr. Countryman and U.S Coordinator for Threat Reduction Programs Bonnie Jenkins, who was in Islamabad recently to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cWithout question, Pakistan takes very seriously its responsibility to provide security for both nuclear weapons and nuclear materials. As a consequence of the summit process as well as our bilateral cooperation, they have taken important steps forward in providing that security,\u201d Mr. Countryman said.\n\nMs. Jenkins, who led the U.S. delegation to the annual meeting of the International Network for Nuclear Security Training and Support Centres (NSSC Network) in Islamabad earlier this month, said Pakistan had been taking effective steps to reduce the risk of terrorists accessing nuclear material in the country.\n\n\u201cWe had a chance to visit their [Pakistan\u2019s] centre of excellence, went to their nuclear regulatory authority \u2026 it showed what they are doing in terms of training on issues of security,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said.",
