    "text": "The Archbishop of Bengaluru, Bernard Moras, said that he has no confirmation on whether Father Tom Uzhunnalil was crucified by the Islamic State on Good Friday, as reported by a few media outlets and on social media on Monday.\n\nFr. Uzhunnalil, who was with the Salesians\u2019 Province of Don Bosco Bengaluru, was abducted in Aden, Yemen, by the IS earlier this month, and there were rumours that he was crucified on Good Friday.\n\n\u201cBut news about Fr. Tom being crucified is not true,\u201d the Archbishop of Bengaluru told The Hindu on Monday evening. \u201cAs soon as I saw the news on social media, I tried contacting people in Bengaluru and Delhi. There is no news at all,\u201d he said, adding that neither Bishop Paul Hinder, the Vicar Apostolic of Southern Arabia, nor Fr. Tom\u2019s superiors in Bengaluru had any confirmation so far.\n\nThough Fr. Uzhunnalil is from a village near Kottayam in Kerala, he has worked for most of his career as a priest in Karnataka.\n\nFr. Ittira Mondoth, a senior clergy of the Salesians\u2019 Province, also maintained that there was no information about Fr. Uzhunnalil.",
