The site where the attack took place had been handed over to the National Investigation Agency, and \u201cit was up to them [the NIA] to decide who should be allowed and who should not.\u201d'\n\n\u201cThe Defence Ministry has issued instructions that the spot where the crime had taken place should be barricaded and no visual allowed. The area has already been separated from the airbase, and is non-functional. Therefore, whether the joint investigation team will be taken to the crime scene or not is to be answered by the NIA. As far as our Ministry is concerned, we have issued directions that the crime scene be barricaded and visually obstructed and external entry given to the NIA alone. If I do not permit them this freedom to investigate, any failure of the investigation will be blamed on us,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Parrikar said the Pakistani team was denied permission to land at the airbase, to use defence vehicles and speak to defence personnel. \u201cNow what the NIA shares with the investigation team and where it takes it is their decision,\u201d he said.",
