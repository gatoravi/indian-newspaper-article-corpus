Joyce Francis, Provincial Superior of the Salesian Order, contested this.\n\n\u201cI do not know from where Father Thelakkat got this information. I am the Provincial superior and I have not made any statement of this nature\u201d he told The Hindu . Later, the Syro Malabar Church spokesperson retracted.",
