Paul on Monday, and said the Appropriation Bill was passed \u201cconstitutionally\u201d in the Assembly on March 18.\n\nOn Sunday, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley alleged that the Speaker, in violation of the constitutional provisions, had shown the Appropriation Bill as passed when a majority of the members voted against it.\n\nCountering Mr. Jaitley\u2019s charge, Mr. Rawat said: \u201cThe Bill was passed constitutionally. We told the Governor that newspaper reports said the Appropriation Bill had not been passed, and the Centre would have to intervene and the Bill would be passed in Parliament. But this must happen only if a State doesn\u2019t have an Assembly. But our State has an Assembly and a budget has been passed by majority in the Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe controversies which led to President\u2019s Rule began in the Assembly on March 18 when nine Congress MLAs, along with the BJP members, voted against the Appropriation Bill after the BJP asked for a division of votes.",
