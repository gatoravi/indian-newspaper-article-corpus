Their colleagues here said \u201c80 per cent\u201d of the bank\u2019s staff across the country participated in similar demonstrations.\n\nThe employees have also expressed concern over the bank\u2019s alleged move to suspend those questioning its practises. \u201cThe bank is randomly suspending employees for asking why the senior management has granted such colossal loans to industrialists without collaterals. As we ask questions and tried to stop the privatisation bid, one of our Deputy General Manager was suspended,\u201d said a demonstrator. The DGM reportedly questioned the top management during a town hall meeting on March 19.\n\n\u201cHowever, he was spot on,\u201d a mid-level manager explained. \u201cVijay Mallya\u2019s Kingfisher Airlines was granted nearly a thousand crore loan despite negative feedback from internal auditors. Moreover, Rs. 200 crore was disbursed to Mallya without formal approval.\u201d\n\nAnother employee was suspended for her Facebook post that employees should transfer their salary to non-IDBI accounts to teach the top management a lesson.\n\nIn a press release issued in New Delhi, the United Platform of the IDBI Bank Unions said: \u201cWe want to protect our customer\u2019s money which defaulters are not paying back. If privatisation happens, there may be no Central Vigilance Commission, no CBI and defaulters like Mallyas may never pay back our customers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government manages to reduce its stake below 50 per cent,\u201d it added, \u201cthen it amounts to selling public money either to some specific corporate entity or foreign institution Moreover, it will erode the public\u2019s trust in public sector banks,\u201d the release said.",
