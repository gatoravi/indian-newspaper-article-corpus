    "text": "Majlum was threatened by cow protection vigilantes to give up trade, says memorandum\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat on Monday submitted a memorandum seeking the intervention of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on the killing of a Muslim cattle trader and a child from the minority community in Jharkhand. Both were allegedly lynched when they were taking cattle to a fair in Latehar district of the State on March 18.\n\n\u201cTheir bodies, with marks which are witness to the terrible beatings they received, were found hanging from a tree in the early morning of March 18,\u201d the CPI(M) Polit Bureau member wrote to NHRC chairman Justice H.L. Dattu and members of the commission.\n\nAs part of a party delegation, she had met the families of the victims and people from different communities in the villages in question, apart form meeting the Chief Minister and the Governor of Jharkhand.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental right of an Indian citizen to peacefully follow his/her chosen profession within the framework of the law has been brutally violated. The basic right to life has been destroyed. This is a case which requires the direct intervention of the National Human Rights Commission,\u201d the memorandum states.\n\n\u201cThe police and the administration are deliberately running a misleading campaign that the murder was a case of robbery by cattle thieves and that there was a personal motive which was the basis for the murder.\u201d",
