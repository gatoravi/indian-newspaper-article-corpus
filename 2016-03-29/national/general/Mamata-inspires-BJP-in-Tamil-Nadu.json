The State had three decades of Congress, followed by three decades of the Communists, she held on, did not compromise, fought on her issues and managed to win the State,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe BJP had been in alliance in the past, once in Assembly and once for the Lok Sabha with the DMK, but we realised the futility of that soon,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not the Mamata model exactly that we choose to follow, but the fact that we need to find our own way in the State,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put down the break-up of the NDA coalition forged before the 2014 general elections to the competing ambitions of the constituent parties.\n\n\u201cAs election in-charge, it was my duty to speak to all the parties that had fought with us in 2014, but we could not come to an agreement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) wanted Anbumani Ramadoss to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate, while Vijayakanth wanted himself to be projected. We decided then to go in for polls with the Indian People\u2019s Party (IPP), the New Justice Party (NJP), the Indhiya Janannayaka Katchi (IJK), then our ally the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) led by Ram Vilas Paswan is also contesting some seats as our some candidates whom Dr. Subramanian Swamy has identified from his erstwhile political party,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Javadekar refused to comment on how many seats the party was hoping to win. \u201cAll I can say is, there is a long way to the polls, and we will get an encouraging response,\u201d he said.\n\nBJP\u2019s election\n\nin-charge refuses\n\nto comment on how many seats the party hopes to win",
