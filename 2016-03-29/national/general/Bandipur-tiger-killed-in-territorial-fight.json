    "text": "A large tiger, aged around 10, was found dead in the Hediyala range of Bandipur National Park on Monday.\n\nThe authorities have ruled out foul play, attributing the death to territorial fight between two male tigers. The death is suspected to have occurred two days ago, according to honorary wildlife warden Naveen Kumar.\n\nThe carcass was found close to the Beladakuppe temple in the core area of the national park; the animal had a deep gnash and bite marks on its neck and mouth, and its tongue was dismembered.\n\nVeterinarian V. Nagaraj, who conducted the post-mortem, said that though the tiger was massive in size, the incisors and two canines had worn out owing to old age and hence it was no match for the new dominant and younger male. The claws and the skin were intact though decomposition had set in, and there was sufficient evidence of a territorial fight at the spot with blood spattered in the vicinity. Tigers have a life span of around 12 years in the wild.\n\nAdditional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Jagatram, ACF, Poovaiah, and Mr. Kumar visited the spot. The carcass was disposed of as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority norms after the post-mortem.",
