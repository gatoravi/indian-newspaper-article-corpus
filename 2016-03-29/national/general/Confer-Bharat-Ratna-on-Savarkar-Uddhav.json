    "text": "Reacting to the latest controversy over revolutionary Veer Savarkar, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Monday asked the Narendra Modi government to confer the Bharat Ratna, the country\u2019s highest civilian honour, on the Hindu Mahasabha leader and put an end to repeated controversies over him.\n\n\u201cSwatantrya Veer Savarkar was the stalwart of revolutionaries. The Congress has insulted not only Veer Savarkar, but all other revolutionaries. Now the government must immediately announce the \u2018Bharat Ratna\u2019 for Veer Savarkar and shut up the Congress permanently,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said in a statement.\n\nThe Mumbai BJP has demanded an apology from the Congress for \u201cinsulting\u201d Savarkar, and threatened to protest outside the homes of Congress MLAs. \u201cThe Modi government must show the courage to confer the Bharat Ratna on Veer Savarkar. In the past, the Shiv Sena staged several agitations over insults to Veer Savarkar, protested against Mani Shankar Aiyar, and even stalled Parliament. Those who stayed away from our agitation are now talking about agitating for Veer Savarkar. This is a good development but, at least now, show some courage,\u201d Mr. Thackeray said.",
