Especially in Bastar region of the State, the journalists are being harassed and threatened with false police and court cases. Journalist Prabhat Singh was arrested from Dantewada district on March 21 and tortured in police custody. On March 26, journalist Deepak Jaiswal was arrested for exposing irregularities during an exam at a school in Geedam town.\u201d\n\nThe Congress also drew attention to how journalist Malini Subramaniam was evicted from Bastar in February. The press, it said, was being barred from doing independent reporting.\n\nResponding to the Congress\u2019s allegations, State Home Minister Ajay Chandrakar said the government was committed to ensuring that journalists in the State work in a \u201cfree and fearless atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to say that false cases are being slapped on journalists in Bastar. In the case of Prabhat Singh, the police were not the complainant. A person named Santosh Tiwari filed a complaint against him under the IT Act for writing an objectionable message on WhatsApp. He was arrested and produced before the court. The same procedure was followed in the case of. Deepak Jaiswal. In the case of the attack on Malini Subramaniam\u2019s house, a complaint was registered against unknown persons and a probe is on.\u201d\n\nCong. moves adjournment motion even as govt. denies press freedom is being curtailed",
