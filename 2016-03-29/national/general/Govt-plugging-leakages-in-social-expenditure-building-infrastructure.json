Of these entrepreneurs, 77 per cent were women and 22 per cent were from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n\u201cEven if we assume conservatively that on average, each enterprise creates just one sustainable job, this initiative itself amounts to 31 million in new employment.\u201d\n\nHe said the Stand-Up India scheme to be launched on April 5 would provide 2,50,000 entrepreneurship loans to women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nMr. Modi defended his pet initiative, Make in India, and promised to remove all distortions in the tax structure disincentivising labour employment. \u201cCorporate tax structure has favoured capital intensive production \u2026 created an artificial bias against labour.\u201d He announced that it had been decided that the database of scores in the government and public sector undertakings recruitment examinations would be made available with candidate information open to all employers, wherever consent was given by the candidate.",
