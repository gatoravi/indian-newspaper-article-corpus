I never get tired,\u201d said Cho, one of dozens of preteens sitting at rows of desks topped with playing boards at the Lee Se-dol School of Go in central Seoul.\n\nMany spend 12 hours a day practising match play with each other in the small, neon-lit, largely windowless rooms of the school named after the grandmaster they all hope to emulate.\n\nAlready well known in East Asia, Lee achieved global recognition earlier this month when he took on Google\u2019s artificial intelligence AlphaGo programme in a five-match showdown. The 33-year-old lost the series, but the battle gave an unprecedented boost to the ancient board game\u2019s international profile.\n\nGo originated in China 3,000 years ago and has been played for centuries mostly in China, Japan and South Korea, with more than 40 million fans worldwide. The rules are simple \u2014 two players take turns placing black or white stones on a square board with a 19x19 grid. Whoever captures the most territory wins.\n\nBut the strategies needed to secure victory are complex, with reportedly more possible move configurations than atoms in the universe.\n\n\u2018An art form\u2019\n\n\u201cGo is not just an entertainment. It\u2019s an art form and a natural philosophy as much as a sport,\u201d said professional player Seo Kon-woo.\n\nThe game is also seen as a tool to help children improve their focus, with hundreds of private Go schools across South Korea offering after-hours tuition.\n\nFor those who show a special skill and affinity for the game, Go also offers a possible career path which, in the case of top players like Lee Se-dol, can lead to fame and fortune. \u201cMany talented kids are discovered when they are five or six, and turn pro before they\u2019re even 12,\u201d said Kim Jung-youl, a veteran coach and head of the Lee Se-dol School.\n\nConsidered one of the greatest Go players of the modern era with 18 international titles, Lee started playing at the age of five and turned pro seven years later.\n\nSouth Korea has around 300 professional players certified by the national Go association, and even those who don\u2019t become star names can make a decent living from tournaments and teaching, players said. \u2014 AFP",
