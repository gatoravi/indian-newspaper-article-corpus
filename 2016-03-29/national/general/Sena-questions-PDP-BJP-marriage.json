    "text": "Referring to the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Afzal Guru\u2019s remains be buried in Kashmir, the Shiv Sena on Monday said the question raised by National Conference leader Omar Abdullah and AAP leaders \u2014 whether the Jammu and Kashmir chief ministerial designate Mehbooba Mufti will chant \u201cBharat Mata Ki Jai\u201d \u2014 was legitimate.\n\n\u201cThe BJP has never got along with Mehbooba Mufti. Her anti-national statements and her affinity with separatists was always a contentious issue. She was also openly sympathetic to Kashmiris who raised anti-India slogans. The BJP may be pleased that Mehbooba Mufti will become the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister, but the country is worried,\u201d an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna said.\n\nThe editorial said in the context of the debate on nationalism, the questions raised by Mufti\u2019s rival Mr. Abdullah, and some AAP leaders from Delhi whether she will chant \u201cBharat Mata Ki Jai\u201d has made the BJP uncomfortable.\n\nWhether Mehbooba Mufti will chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai is a valid question, says Saamna",
