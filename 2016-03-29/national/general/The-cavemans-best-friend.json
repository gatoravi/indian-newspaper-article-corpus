To their astonishment, they discovered an Ice Age puppy\u2019s snout peeking out from the permafrost.\n\nFive years later, a pair of puppies perfectly preserved in the region of Yakutia and dating back 12,460 years has mobilised scientists across the world.\n\nLink to domestication\n\n\u201cTo find a carnivorous mammal intact with skin, fur and internal organs \u2014 this has never happened before in history,\u201d said Sergei Fyodorov, head of exhibitions at the Mammoth Museum of the North-Eastern Federal University in the regional capital of Yakutsk. And the discovery could contribute to the lively scientific debate over the origin of domesticated dogs.\n\nWhen the hunters stumbled on the first frozen pup, they alerted Mr. Fyodorov who immediately flew out to the remote Arctic tundra.\n\nWhen he returned for a more thorough look and found the second puppy close to the same spot, farther down the slope. Both had died when they were about three months old. They most likely come from the same litter, said Mr. Fyodorov.\n\nLast week, he oversaw the removal of the second puppy\u2019s remarkably well-preserved brain.\n\n\u201cPuppies are very rare, because they have thin bones and delicate skulls,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Fyodorov said a preliminary look at the mammoth remains also found at the dig suggested some had been butchered and burned, hinting at the presence of humans.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the puppies were domesticated or wild.\n\nThe answer can only be determined by reconstructing their genomes, which would take at least a year.\n\n\u201cThus far, the lineages of wolves that likely gave rise to dogs have not yet been discovered and it\u2019s possible that these puppies could be on that lineage, which would be very exciting,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Greger Larson of University of Oxford, one of the scientists behind a collaborative project aimed at finding out when and where dogs became the first domesticated animals.\n\nWhat makes the dog particularly intriguing is that it managed to become \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d even before humans became settled farmers.\n\nIt is still unclear whether dogs were domesticated in one place or in several places independently, and whether the process started when humans took in cubs or whether wolves themselves gradually drifted to human sites in search of food.\n\nWhatever their precise lineage, the Ice Age pups will keep Mr. Fyodorov and other scientists busy for some time.\n\nThe second puppy\u2019s preserved brain will be compared with that of modern dogs and wolves. Parasites found on its body will be analysed, as will the contents of its stomach, which Mr. Fyodorov is particularly excited about.\n\n\u201cWhen we opened it, we were very surprised. The second puppy\u2019s stomach is mostly full of twigs and grass,\u201d he said, wondering if perhaps the animals were not exclusively carnivorous or whether they started eating grass after they were trapped by a mudslide and began to starve.\n\n\u201cThis material is really exceptional and unique,\u201d said Mietje Germonpre, a palaeontologist from the Royal Belgian Institute who partnered with Mr. Fyodorov on the project and came to Yakutsk to oversee the autopsy of the second puppy earlier this month. \u201cThe fact that soft tissue is preserved will give much more information compared to information that can be obtained from \u2018normal\u2019 fossils.\u201d\n\nMr. Fyodorov lamented the long time it takes to get ancient biological material to suitable labs due to financial constraints, the rugged terrain and red tape which sometimes means that samples reach laboratories only six months later.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that the tissue of mammoth fauna loses its structure with every passing second, even in the freezer,\u201d he said. \u2014 AFP",
