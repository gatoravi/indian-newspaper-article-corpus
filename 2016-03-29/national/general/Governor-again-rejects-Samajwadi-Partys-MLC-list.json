    "text": "In continuation of the political stand-off between Raj Bhavan and the ruling Samajwadi Party, Governor Ram Naik on Monday rejected the five names proposed by the Uttar Pradesh government for nomination to the State Legislative Council.\n\nMr. Naik said the names recommended by the State did not qualify for the category as per constitutional norms and that some had criminal cases against them. They also did not have any special knowledge or practical experience in the fields of science, art, literature, co-operative movement or social service, as mandated by Article 171 (5) of the Constitution, he said.\n\nIn May 2015, Mr. Yadav forwarded a list of nine names to the Governor for nomination as MLCs. On July 2, Mr. Naik approved four names \u2014 S.R.S Yadav, Lilawati Kushwaha, Ram Vriksh Singh Yadav and Jitendra Yadav \u2014 but he rejected the remaining five, raising questions on their profiles, and sought more information about them.\n\nThen in October, Mr. Naik again asked Mr. Yadav to review the five names sent by him \u2014 Kamlesh Pathak, Ranvijay Singh, Abdul Sarfaraz Khan, Sanjay Seth and Rajpal Kashyap.\n\nMr. Naik, in a letter to the government while returning the file, also mentioned that he held discussions with the CM on the matter on several occasions.\n\nMr. Yadav had assured him that he would send a fresh list, but Raj Bhavan had not received any, Mr. Naik said.\n\n\u2018While some have criminal record, others have no special knowledge in any field\u2019",
