    "text": "In a stern warning to wilful defaulters like Vijay Mallya, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said they should settle their dues honourably with the banks or else be ready to face \u201ccoercive action\u201d by lenders and investigative agencies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make any comments on individual cases but I think it\u2019s a responsibility of large groups like his (Vijay Mallya\u2019s) to honourably settle their dues with the banks,\u201d he told PTI in an interview here.\n\nHe further said that banks have certain collaterals of group companies of Vijay Mallya and will take legal action to recover dues that are in excess of Rs. 9,000 crore.\n\n\u201cBanks have some securities. Banks plus other agencies have also coercive methods available with them through legal enforcement...these are all being investigated by relevant agencies,\u201d he said. Mr. Mallya, promoter of long-grounded Kingfisher Airlines, had left India on March 2, presumably for London, days before the Supreme Court heard a plea of clutch of state-owned banks seeking recovery from his group firms. Mr. Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines owed Rs. 7,800 crore to a consortium of 17 lenders led by State Bank. \u2014 PTI",
