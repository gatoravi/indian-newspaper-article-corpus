    "text": "The Odisha Assembly witnessed pandemonium on Monday as the Opposition, Congress, demanded a statement from Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on the alleged gang-rape of a college girl on March 23.\n\nThe issue was raised by Congress Chief Whip Taraprasad Bahinipati during Zero hour when he referred to a local news item saying that a college girl student was allegedly gang-raped in a moving car between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. Alleging that no action had been taken against the rapists so far, Mr.Bahinipati demanded a statement from Patnaik, who holds the Home portfolio. Seeking a ruling from the Chair, Congress MLAs rushed tothe Well of the house and drew the attention of the deputy speaker Sadan Marndi to the issue. Though BJP member K V Singhdeo wanted to raise an issue during Zero Hour, he was not allowed to speak by the Congress members who created a din in the Well of the House. - PTI",
