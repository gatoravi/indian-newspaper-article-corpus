    "text": "Retired judge Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the first woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, is the brain behind the popular interactive video game\n\nJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who turned 86 on Saturday, has many achievements to her name, including serving as a State Senator in Arizona and becoming the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, where she served for almost a quarter-century.\n\nNow she can add an accomplishment for the digital era: video game impresario.\n\nJustice O\u2019Connor is behind an animated civics education game called \u2018Win the White House, whose latest edition was recently released. The game has been played by more than 2,50,000 students just this month and is barnstorming its way through middle schools across the United States.\n\nCurrent issues\n\nIn the game \u2014 timed to this election cycle \u2014 students take on the role of imaginary presidential candidates who must learn how to compete civilly against opponents with divergent views on issues like immigration and gun control. That Justice O\u2019Connor would become an interactive game enthusiast may seem unexpected. Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game \u2014 let alone played one.\n\n\u201cI was one of the uneducated adults,\u201d she joked in a recent telephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning objective of \u2018Win the White House\u2019, she explained: \u201cWe have to have a system that allows young people to approach problem solving from many different viewpoints.\u201d\n\nJustice O\u2019Connor became involved in digital games after retiring from the Supreme Court in 2006. She started iCivics, a non-profit civics education group, in 2009. The group has since released 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year, the group said.\n\nJustice O\u2019Connor is getting colleagues involved in the effort as well. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined iCivics\u2019 governing board in November.\n\nIn a phone interview Friday, Justice Sotomayor said she thought it was \u201cbrilliant of Justice O\u2019Connor to realise that computer games could be a very successful way to interest kids in civics education.\u201d Justice Sotomayor, who said she developed an early interest in law after watching the Perry Mason television show, said she had incorporated iCivics into her own frequent visits to schools, where she encourages students to learn how government works and to get involved in their communities.\n\n\u201cI thought this was really in keeping with my message to kids about how laws affect you every single day,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said, adding that she has played the games. \u201cThey\u2019re fun. I\u2019ve challenged my clerks to play them to see how they do.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of the two justices in digital educational games underscores a growing belief among educators that interactive tools may improve students\u2019 engagement in their own learning. In January, Microsoft introduced an educational version of Minecraft, the hit game in which players use blocks to construct elaborate virtual worlds. Last fall, Google unveiled Expeditions, a virtual reality system for classroom use that takes students on simulated field trips around the world.\n\nTeachers who have used \u2018Win the White House\u2019 said the game helped their students experience and understand the complicated trade-offs that candidates often make.\n\nLearning politics\n\nAnna Nelson, assistant principal at Bronx Latin, a high school in New York City, recently divided her 12th-grade honours civics class into Democratic and Republican teams and assigned them to play the game. Along the way, her students learned the difference between conservative and liberal political beliefs and that candidates had to stick to the platforms they had chosen, she said. They also learned to select running mates from different backgrounds to broaden their appeal with voters.\n\n\u201cIt taught them so many things in one short simulation,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. Now, when they come to class, they want to discuss new developments in the actual presidential primaries with her, she said.\n\nJustice Sotomayor suggested parents play the games with their children as well. \u201cDo you know how many adults don\u2019t know anything about civics?\u201d she said.\n\nJustice O\u2019Connor said she started iCivics out of concern that many schools had abandoned the idea of teaching students to become engaged citizens. She said she worried that students would not grow up to become good leaders, or even active voters, if they did not understand, say, the importance of an independent judiciary or their right to due process.\n\n\u201cGovernment isn\u2019t handed down in the genes,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt has to be taught through every generation.\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
