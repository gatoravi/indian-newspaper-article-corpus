The police and Asaram\u2019s lawyers agreed that he can appear through video-link. Asaram appeared before the sessions judge Rizwana Ghoghari via a video-link on Monday.\n\nHe denied the charges against him and asked the court to conduct the trial at the earliest.\n\nThe court set April 13 as the next date. \u2014 PTI",
