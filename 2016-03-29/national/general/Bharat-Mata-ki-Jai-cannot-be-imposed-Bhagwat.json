We do not want to win or defeat anyone. Nor impose our ideology and thoughts on anyone. We wish to show them the path because we accept them as our own,\u201d Mr. Bhagwat told the Sangh cadre in Lucknow, at the unveiling of the renovated \u2018Kisan bhawan\u2019 at the historic Smriti Bhawan, the RSS office where the foundation for the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh was laid in 1951.",
