    "text": "Three months after 52-year-old Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched in a Dadri village following rumours about cow slaughter, the murder continues to haunt the village.\n\nSanjay Rana, a local BJP leader, suddenly found himself at the centre of the lynching case. His son, Vishal, and his friend Shivam allegedly played the main role in spreading the rumour about cow slaughter that incited a violent mob gathered outside Akhlaq\u2019s house. However, going by the account of events as narrated by Mr. Rana, what happened in the aftermath of the lynching case was a \u201ctragedy\u201d for him as well for several reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, my son was arrested for no fault of his. Secondly, Akhlaq\u2019s lynching became an opportunity for people to vilify me and the BJP, the political party I am associated with,\u201d he told this correspondent while standing outside the chief judicial magistrate\u2019s court in Greater Noida. Mr. Rana was waiting for Vishal who was expected to be brought to the Dadri court to be given a copy of the case charge sheet.\n\nDuring the media coverage post-lynching, Mr. Rana\u2019s name was reported largely as a local BJP leader but very few know that as a \u2018kar sevak\u2019, he played an active role in the Ram Mandir agitation in 1990 when the Hindutva movement to build the temple was at its peak.\n\nIn fact, as he remembered, he was one of the lakhs of \u2018kar sevaks\u2019 who had assembled in Ayodhya in October 1990 when the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered firing on \u2018kar sevaks\u2019 who attempted to go near the disputed site of Ramjanmbhoomi-Babri structure.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget that day when we were fired at. Several of us were killed. I was arrested and was in jail for about a week,\u201d he said.\u201cI am paying the price for my long association with the BJP,\u201d he said, accusing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of \u201ctargeting\u201d him for \u201cvote bank politics\u201d.\n\nMr. Rana told The Hindu that the \u201clynching\u201d was \u201cindeed horrific and ghastly\u201d. He also claimed that he tried to save Akhlaq whose house is about a 10-minutes walk from Mr. Rana\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to know about what happened with Akhlaq bhai , I was the one who called the police. I tried to save him,\u201d said the BJP leader whose son and six other relatives are accused of being part of the mob that allegedly dragged Akhlaq out of his house and lynched him.\n\n\u2018My son innocent\u2019\n\nMr. Rana said as opposed to the claims of the police, Vishal (22) was not in the village that day. \u201cMy son is innocent. I can\u2019t imagine him doing anything even remotely like that. He was in Delhi that night. He came home the next day. Police arrested him five days later,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, however, Vishal and his friend Shivam told the police that they were provoked by some people on the claims that Akhlaq had killed a cow.\n\nDenying that the murder was premeditated or there was a possibility of \u201cconspiracy\u201d, Mr. Rana said, \u201cAkhlaq bhai died because of the mob frenzy. This is what happens when mob frenzy takes over. Strong sentiments are involved because Hindus consider cow as their mother\u201d.",
