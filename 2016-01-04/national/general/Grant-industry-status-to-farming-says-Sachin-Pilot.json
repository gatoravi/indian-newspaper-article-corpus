The BJP government in Rajasthan must gather the courage to do that,\u201d said Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot here on Sunday.\n\nSuch a move would give relief to the farmers of Rajasthan since agriculture would then encompass loan exemption, insurance, facility for taking loans, and access to markets, Mr. Pilot said.\n\nThe Congress leader had claimed that over 60 farmers had committed suicide in Rajasthan in 2015 as their crop was destroyed due to excessive rainfall.",
