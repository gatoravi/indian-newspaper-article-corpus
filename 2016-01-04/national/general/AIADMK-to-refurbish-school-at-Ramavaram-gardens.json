Students of the school, numbering nearly 100 were stranded in the hostel building along with staff and trainees of the training centre for teaching the deaf.\n\n\u201cWhen the CM heard that our children needed to be rescued, she immediately sent NDRF and Army teams to save them. They were taken to secure high-rise buildings and then later taken to Dr. MGR Janaki College for Women,\u201d said school principal Latha Rajendran.\n\nFunds from AIADMK will be used to provide equipment for classrooms, says Jayalalithaa",
