    "text": "A day after the Pathankot attack, Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal asked the Centre to increase deployment of Border Security Force personnel along the border districts of Punjab, especially Pathankot and Gurdaspur.\n\nEven as the government and the RSS defended the recent engagement with Pakistan, the BJP threw hints that the future of the talks would also depend on how the neighbouring country responded to the Pathankot situation in the times to come.\n\nThis comes even as the Shiromani Akali Dal backed talks with Pakistan while the Congress accused the BJP government of \u2018U-turns\u2019 on the saffron party\u2019s stand on Pakistan when in opposition.\n\n\u201cWe are writing to the Centre asking them to deploy more BSF troops to prevent such attacks in future. Also, we will set up a second line of defence,\u201d Mr. Badal told the media in Punjab on Sunday. He said the State police would soon come out with a \u2018master plan\u2019 for the second line of defence so that if some terrorists manage to sneak from the border into our territory, the police should be able to deal with the situation effectively.\n\nOn talks with Pak., BJP leader says: \u2018We will take right decision at right time\u2019",
