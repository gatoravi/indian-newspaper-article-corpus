She says, the girls\u2019 parents \u201casked me whether it will be safe for girls to play in track suits; \u2018won\u2019t it make them vulnerable to boys? Why don\u2019t you teach them some household work instead of kabaddi?\u2019 There were so many questions!\u201d\n\nMs. Sheikh, a third-year B.Com student, is a volunteer with Parivartan, a programme run by the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), Apanalaya (an NGO in Mumbai), and the STRIVE research consortium (from the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine). Parivartan seeks to address gender discrimination using sports, connecting girls with mentors, coaching them on teamwork, skills and empowerment.\n\nFor many of the families of Shivaji Nagar, even the idea of girls entering the playground without an accompanying male family member was alien. Undeterred by the reactions, Ms. Sheikh visited families and personally persuaded them to let the girls play. Her efforts paid off. On Sunday, 75 girls played their first-ever kabaddi tournament at the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar ground in Govandi.\n\nSupportive parents\n\nAfter the initial hesitation, many parents were very supportive. Bahadur Sheikh, a resident of Shivaji Nagar who had come to watch his daughter play in the tournament, said, \u201cIf they don\u2019t go out and study, how will they progress? People can say what they want, but I wanted to see my daughter happy so I let her play here.\u201d Ms. Sheikh is one of 10 mentors who worked with the girls to train them and make the tournament happen. She, like the others, was herself first trained by coaches from the Maharashtra State Kabaddi Association. Chand Bi, another mentor, said, \u201cForget about the girls; even we had never done exercise!\u201d She says that she wanted to overturn the perception of kabaddi being a masculine sport: \u201cWe want to prove it to all that we too can play it.\u201d Ms. Sheikh\u2019s motivations were similar.\n\nMadhumita Das, project leader from ICRW, told The Hindu , \u201cWe wanted to make it a different programme. Instead of going through regular closed door workshops and talks on gender equality, we thought sport would be the best way to bring girls together. And they loved it.\u201d\n\nStarted a year and half ago, Parivartan initially had 174 girls enrolled, a number which has since fallen to 100. \u201cOnce a decent marriage proposal comes in, the girls are married off, without seeking her opinion or thinking about her education,\u201d Ms. Das said. The Parivartan team is well aware of the enormity of the task ahead. Ravi Verma, Regional Director, ICRW\u2019s Asia Regional Office, said, \u201cPromoting gender equality won\u2019t happen overnight. It requires hard work, innovation and perseverance.\u201d",
