Abdul Kalam, and held him up as the symbol of a scientist and technologist devoted to the nation\u2019s development.\n\nTribute to Kalam\n\n\u201cGood governance is not just about policy but about integrating science and technology into the choices we make,\u201d he said. \u201cYour theme for this congress is a fitting tribute to Dr. Kalam\u2019s vision.\u201d The theme for the 103rd edition of the Indian Science Congress is \u2018Science and Technology for Indigenous Development in India.\u2019\n\nReferring to his address in Paris at the United Nations climate change summit, Mr. Modi emphasised that innovation was not only for tackling climate change but also about delivering \u201cclimate justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing energy from the oceans as well as the use of geothermal energy and the recently-constituted International Solar Alliance \u2014 a global initiative of top industrialists from Bill Gates to Mukesh Ambani \u2014 were key measures to achieve a low-carbon, sustainable energy future.\n\nMr. Modi said the world couldn\u2019t ignore the importance of the oceans and their sustainability would be key to economies.\n\n\u201cWe are at the cusp of a new era, where oceans will become important drivers of our economies. Their sustainable use can bring prosperity; and, give us clean energy, new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is why, in the past year, we have increased our focus on ocean or blue economy and have set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology. We have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries and will also hold an international conference on \u201cOcean economy and Pacific Island Countries\u201d in New Delhi this year.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural session of the five-day congress had about 5,000-7000 students, speakers and scientists from across the country in attendance along with Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala; Chief Minister Siddaramaiah; Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister of Science and Technology and Y.S. Chowdary, Minister of State for Science and Technology.\n\nNobel laureates John Gurdon, David Gross, Dan Schechtman and Serge Haroche as also Indian-origin Canadian-American mathematician and Field Medalist, Manjul Bhargava were among those feted by Mr. Modi for their contribution to science.\n\nHarsh Vardhan cautious\n\nDr. Harsh Vardhan said that this year he would steer clear of any references to the contributions of ancient India to science.\n\n\u201cMy remarks last year got more space and took precedence over more important scientific issues such as climate change,\u201d he said, referring to the furore at the Science Congress in Mumbai last year where \u2018scientific sessions\u2019 on ancient aircraft and Vedic surgery took space along with presentations on science.\n\n\u2018Good governance\n\nis also about integrating science and technology\n\ninto our choices\u2019",
