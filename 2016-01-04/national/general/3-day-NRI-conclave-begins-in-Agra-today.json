Film Vikas Parishad, told reporters here.\n\nNRIs who have excelled in various fields will be felicitated at the event. \u201cEfforts would be made to expose youths before NRIs and prepare a viable ground for any investment in U.P.,\u201d Mr Kapoor said.\n\nThe State government is making arrangements for the investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in Metro projects in five cities including Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi.\n\nHe claimed that at present the growth rate of the State stood at 6.8 per cent which is higher than the national growth rate. \u201cRs 20,000 crore have been invested during the past two years in small and medium industries,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the State government said it has invited only NRIs from U.P. and there may have been some confusion. The State government did not extend invitation to any non-U.P. NRI, the official said, adding \u201cthe incident may have occurred due to some misunderstanding\u201d. -- PTI\n\nThe government has invited\n\nNon-Resident Indians from\n\nUttar Pradesh only",
