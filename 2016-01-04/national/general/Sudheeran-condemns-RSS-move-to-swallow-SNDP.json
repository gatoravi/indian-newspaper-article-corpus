M. Sudheeran has fired the opening salvo against SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellapally Natesan on the eve of his much publicised \u201cJana Raksha Yatra\u201d scheduled to commence in Kasargode on Monday.\n\nIn a lengthy press release that set the tone for his one-month-long political tour of the State, Mr. Sudheeran condemned the RSS move to \u2018swallow\u2019 the socially reformist, essentially liberal and inherently progressive SNDP movement.\n\nHe said the Prime Minister\u2019s office and Mr. Natesan were responsible for the last minute withdrawal of the invitation to Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to participate in the unveiling of the R. Sankar statue in Kollam. Mr. Natesan\u2019s newly launched party was an RSS front. The BJP\u2019s bid to usurp the political legacy of R. Shankar would fail. Mr. Natesan\u2019s actions and comments were deeply divisive and communal.\n\nMr. Sudheeran touted the decision to close 730 non-5 star bar hotels as a singular social welfare achievement of the State Government. He claimed there has been a record 20.27 per cent dip in the legal sale of alcohol since the policy was implemented in April last.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision, which vindicated the government\u2019s pro-prohibition stance, had given an added impetus to his \u2018yatra\u2019. It would conclude in the capital on February 9. Flagging rubber, coconut and cardamom prices had driven farmers to debt and poverty.\n\nUnrestricted import had caused the prices to deteriorate. The fall in crude oil prices had not benefited the public.\n\nThe \u2018yatra\u2019 will highlight the UDF government\u2019s liquor policy and the need the fight communalism, among other issues.",
