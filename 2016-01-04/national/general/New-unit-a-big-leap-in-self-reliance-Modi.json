Mr. Modi said he hoped to see the first aircraft coming out of the facility in 2018.\n\nRecalling former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri\u2019s call of \u201cJai jawan jai kisan\u201d, Mr. Modi said self-reliance in food had been achieved and now it had to be fulfilled in equipment for the defence sector. Indigenous manufacturing of the latest technologies, Mr. Modi said, was a crying need in a global situation where foreign arms suppliers gave costly but outdated arms and ammunition.\n\nThe Rs. 5,000-crore copter complex \u2014 easily the biggest investment in this backward region \u2014 would boost the government's \u2018Make in India\u2019 agenda. It would also provide 4,000 jobs.\n\nDefence Minister Manohar Parrikar said the contribution of HAL had been significant in the past seven and half decades and has spearheaded the national defence and aerospace programmes.\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah said Karnataka had introduced an Aerospace Policy and conceived an Aerospace and Defence Park at Devanahalli.\n\nThe government was setting up a Special Process Facility and Aerospace Technology Centre in partnership with National Aeronautical Agency and HAL. They were also encouraging industry to tie up with Industrial Training Institutes for manpower.\n\nHe said Karnataka was hosting a three-day mega investor summit, \u2018Invest Karnataka - 2016\u2019, from February 3 at the sprawling Bengaluru Palace Grounds. Aerospace is one of the focus sectors in the Investors\u2019 Meet and there would be a special session, he said.",
