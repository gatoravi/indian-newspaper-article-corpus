Police fear they will take hostages too. Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi called a meeting of the force\u2019s top officers on Sunday morning. Later, in a tweet, he advised the public to be vigilant and report suspicious persons and activities.\n\nAn officer privy to the meeting said the police sought deployment of Central paramilitary forces at certain locations and outside important establishments in the city. While the Capital was already on high alert since the Pathankot terror attack, the latest inputs have prompted the police to deploy a large number of its personnel outside airport, railway stations, bus terminals and certain government establishments.\n\nPolice presence has also been increased at popular markets and in VIP movement zones. All vehicles entering Delhi are being thoroughly checked.\n\nSince there were specific inputs that VIPs are on the terrorists\u2019 radar, the crime branch and special cell have been roped in to come up with a strategy.",
