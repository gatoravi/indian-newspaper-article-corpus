    "text": "The political leadership of Jammu and Kashmir \u2014 both separatists and mainstream parties \u2014 want the India-Pakistan dialogue process, which seemed to be in some doubt after Saturday\u2019s terror attack, to continue.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , the State\u2019s septuagenarian separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said the Pathankot violence should not be linked with the talks. The two countries should continue to engage with each other and resolve Kashmir and other disputes, he said.\n\nNational Conference leader Ali Muhammad Saga said the strike was an attempt to derail the dialogue process.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party said India should not give up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif\u2019s attempts to resolve the pending disputes.\n\n\u201cPakistan itself is a victim of terror,\u201d said PDP spokesperson Waheed Parra.\n\n\u201cWe must understand that some non-State actors are hurting us. The whole country is not supporting terrorists.\u201d",
