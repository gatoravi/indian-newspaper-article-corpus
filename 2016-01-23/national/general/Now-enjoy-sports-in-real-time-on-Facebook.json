People already turn to Facebook to celebrate, commiserate, and talk trash with their friends and other fans,\u201d wrote Steve Kafka, product manager, in a Facebook Post.\n\nWith Facebook Sports Stadium, it may be tough for Sports Twitter to keep up as Twitter has only 320 million monthly users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now built a place devoted to sports so that you can get the feeling you\u2019re watching the game with your friends even when you are not together,\u201d Mr. Kafka said.\n\nWith Facebook Sports Stadium, all the content on Facebook related to the game is assembled at one place and it comes in real time and appears chronologically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a second-screen experience that we hope makes watching the broadcast even better,\u201d Mr. Kafka said.\n\n\u201cYou can get to Facebook Sports Stadium by searching for the game, and we will surface new ways to get there as the product evolves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rolling this out for American football games and will support other sports around the world like basketball, soccer, and more soon. The experience is available now on iPhone in the U.S., and will expand to other platforms in the coming weeks,\u201d a Facebook post said. \u2014 IANS",
