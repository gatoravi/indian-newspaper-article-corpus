Satchidanandan said: \u201cThe word bhasha has a baggage of representing something which is secondary, and I have a problem with the way the word bhasha [sahitya] is used today. All languages must be named.\u201d Mr. Satchidanandan, who resigned from all committees of the Sahitya Akademi to protest against the killing of writer M.M. Kalburgi and the Akademi\u2019s failure to stand with the writers, said no language must be treated as secondary. \u201cNot treating a language as an important one leads to marginalisation of voices,\u201d he said.\n\nGujarati p+oet and writer Sitanshu Yashaschandra said: \u201cMy plea is not to call us bhasha sahityakars , but to call us sahityakars .\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many Indian languages and each language has a literature. The categorisation of Indian literatures as bhasha sahitya is colonial. I reject it,\u201d Mr. Yashaschandra said.\n\nMr. Yashaschandra said that the term bhasha was used as a second grade term against English, which was considered an international language of literature.",
