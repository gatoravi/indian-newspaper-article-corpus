    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday eulogised Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s struggle and penchant for education, repeating the Dalit icon\u2019s mantra of \u2018educate, agitate, organise.\u2019\n\nSpeaking at the 6th convocation of the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University here, Mr. Modi told the students that Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s life was marked by difficulties, insults and neglect but he didn\u2019t waste time in complaining.\n\nMr. Modi also paid tributes to Babasaheb on the premises of the Babasaheb Ambedkar Mahasabha. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to reach out to Dalits during his convocation speech, Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr. Ambedkar criticised Mr. Modi for \u201cblatant hypocrisy.\u201d According to him, the RSS and BJP were trying to suppress the \u201chumane\u201d values of Babasaheb.\n\n\u201cThe fight is Ambedkarites versus the RSS Vedic philosophy; between equality and inequality. To fight those values and suppress the silent masses who support Ambedkar the RSS is trying to muffle the voice of \u2018vibrant Ambedkarites,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ambedkar said.\n\nThe former MP, however, said it was unlikely that Dalits would fall for such \u201cantics\u201d of the RSS and Mr. Modi in the U.P. elections.",
