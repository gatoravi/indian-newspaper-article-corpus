Mohammad Shafi Armar of Bhatkal, who left for Pakistan along with his brother Mohammad Sultan Armar, is said to be the brain behind the online recruitment of young men across the country for the Islamic State (IS). He is said to be operating under the alias of Yousuf.\n\nArmar, a key member of the Ansar-ul-Tawhid, an offshoot of the IM, which later on pledged its allegiance to the IS, reportedly operates from Syria. \u201cHe is the common link between all the recent IS-linked modules busted in the country,\u201d said a senior official.\n\nHe first he scouts for probable recruits on public platforms such as Facebook. He then uses Web-based applications for one-to-one contact and then moves to other encryption-free applications such as Telegram, said an official.\n\nSultan Armar was killed in March 2015 while fighting alongside the IS in Syria.\n\nThe Armar brothers\u2019 link to the IS first figured during the interrogation of Yasin Bhatkal, arrested in 2013.",
