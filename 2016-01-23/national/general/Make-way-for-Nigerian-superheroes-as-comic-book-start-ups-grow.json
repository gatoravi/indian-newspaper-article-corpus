Teni is the creation of Jide Martins, the founder of Comic Republic, one of a handful of comic startups making African superheroes to rival Iron Man, Batman and Spiderman.\n\nUnlike Storm, a beloved X-Men superhero who is a dual citizen of the United States and the fictional country Wakanda, the superheroes Mr. Martins brings to life are born and raised in Africa \u2014 and fight there too.\n\n\u201cIn university, I started wondering what it would be like if Superman came to Nigeria,\u201d Mr. Martins said at his flat in Lagos, where his dining room doubles as a studio for his team of young illustrators. \u201cPeople are trying to break away from the norm and find new things to aspire to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be white to save the world.\u201d\n\nDigital and free\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Martins, a slim 37-year-old with a freckled nose and goatee beard, published his first issue of Guardian Prime , a hero wearing a forest green and snow white super-suit in the colours of the Nigerian flag. Since then, readership has swelled from 100 an issue to over 28,000. Despite the 30-plus page comic books being free and only available as a digital download, Mr. Martins is able to generate enough money through advertising and spin-off projects, including educational booklets on malaria featuring his characters, to keep the business running. \u201cPeople had this idea that African comics had to be with people in traditional clothes, but I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d Mr. Martins said. \u201cLet them have Nigerian names, saving people in Nigeria, but let\u2019s put them in spandex.\u201d\n\nMr. Martins isn\u2019t the only one realising the potential of the burgeoning African superhero industry, which adapts the continent\u2019s long tradition of voodoo and the occult for a modern-day audience.\n\nRoye Okupe is the creator of E.X.O. \u2014 The Legend of Wale Williams , a graphic novel set in Lagoon City, a futuristic Lagos riddled with corruption and besieged by an extremist insurrection.\n\nOkupe, a 30-year-old who grew up in the Nigerian megacity of 20 million people, saw a market for an African character grounded in reality. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not able to name five African superheroes off the top of your head,\u201d Mr. Okupe said from Washington, where he is based. \u201cAnd as much as I love Black Panther, he\u2019s from a fictional African country.\u201d\n\nAt a time when superheroes dominate the international box office, Mr. Okupe says Nigerians are uniquely poised to offer alternatives to the waspy roster of Clark Kents and Peter Parkers.\n\n\u201cTen years ago if you released a superhero from Nigeria, I don\u2019t think anybody would have cared,\u201d Mr. Okupe said. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s a popular industry, people want diversity.\u201d\n\nFor scholars on comic books, African superheroes are an inevitable reaction to a predominantly white cast of caped crusaders.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Ronald Jackson, co-editor of the 2013 book Black Comics: Politics of Race and Representation . \u201cAs we begin to appreciate other identities, we\u2019re going to become increasingly more embracing of the kind of images coming out of African comics.\u201d Back in the Comic Republic studio, the team of illustrators \u2014 all under 30 \u2014 hope that one day their characters will appear on the silver screen.\n\nSoon in theatres?\n\nThey\u2019re betting that their African cast, including witches stronger than the Jedi warriors in Star Wars , will be more than enough to keep international audiences excited.\n\n\u201cYou hear about Greek gods like Zeus but no one has heard of Shango, the god of lightning in Yoruba,\u201d 23-year-old illustrator Tobe Ezeogu said. \u201cIt's a different take to what people are used to.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
