One of the cops even put a gun to my head and demanded where we had hidden the weapons,\u201d recounted Bushra Tabussam, 31, wife of the techie Mohammed Afzal, 35, who was picked up by NIA sleuths from Hegde Nagar for his suspected links to the Islamic State (IS).\n\nHe was one of the two persons arrested in the sweep that saw four others being detained in the State. For the families, who got news of the charges from snippets on television, the sudden raid has led to overwhelming anxiety engulfing their households.\n\n\u201cThe sleuths neither produced an arrest warrant nor have given us immediate family with an arrest memo. We fear that he will be framed,\u201d said Ms.Tabussam, a human resource executive. The couple have a four-year-old child.\n\nIn Mangaluru, Saiful Huda, father of Najmul Huda, who was arrested on similar charges, claimed that his son was innocent. \u201cAll he did was to share Islamic State material on Facebook. The NIA personnel assured me they will release him soon,\u201d said Mr. Huda, a moulvi at Bajpe on the outskirts of the city.\n\nFour detained\n\nThough the remaining four have been detained, their fate remains uncertain as NIA sleuths scour for evidence that could lead to their arrest.",
