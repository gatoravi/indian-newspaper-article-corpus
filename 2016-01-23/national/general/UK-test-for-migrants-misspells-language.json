    "text": "In an embarrassment, Britain\u2019s Home Office on Friday spelt the word \u201clanguage\u201d wrong while announcing the new English test to be forced on migrants from non-EU countries who face deportation if they fail to clear the examination.\n\nLanguage was misspelled \u201clangauge\u201d in the original press release by the Home Office, giving details of the new tests and was corrected only after Twitter users ridiculed the error. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis was a regrettable typographical error that has now been corrected.\u201d\n\nThe new rules apply to family members of British nationals who are citizens of countries outside the European Union, including India.\n\nPartners and parents in the U.K. on a spousal or family visa will now need to pass a speaking and listening test after two-and-a half-years in the UK in order to qualify for further \u201cleave to remain\u201d en route to their \u201cpermanent settlement\u201d in the U.K. after five years.\n\n\u201cThe new A2 requirement delivers the government\u2019s manifesto commitment to ensure that those coming to the UK on a family visa with only basic English will become more fluent over time.\n\nIt will mean that the person can better engage in everyday conversation and thereby better participate and integrate in everyday life in the community,\u201d the Home Office release said.\n\nThe new requirement will be implemented from October 2016 and therefore not affect those required to apply for further leave to remain before then.\n\nThe announcement follows British Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s speech on Monday announcing new plans to better integrate sections of the British society. \u2014 PTI",
