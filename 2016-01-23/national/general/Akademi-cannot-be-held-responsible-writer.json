Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar. Speaking to reporters Mr. Bhardwaj said: \u201cThe situation in the country was different when we returned the award. At that time writers and rationalists were being killed. [Kannada writer] Kalburgi was with the Sahitya Akademi and that is why so many award-winners objected to the Akademi\u2019s silence over his killing.\u201d\n\nMr. Bhardwaj, a Rajasthani and Hindi writer, said the Akademi held a meeting when the awards were being returned and condemned the killing. \u201cThe Akademi has stated that it would stand with the writers. I respect the Akademi\u2019s decisions. Intolerance and other issues remain, but now I woul dn\u2019t hold the Akademi responsible since that\u2019s not its mandate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018It has assured us that it will stand with the writers\u2019",
