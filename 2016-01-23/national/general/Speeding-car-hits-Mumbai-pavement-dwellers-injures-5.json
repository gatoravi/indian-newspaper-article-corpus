According to the Pydhonie police, the incident occurred around 12.30 a.m. at the Bhendi Bazaar junction. Khan was trying his hand at driving his friend\u2019s car, a top-end model said to have sold for over Rs. 2 crore in India.\n\nSenior Police Inspector Sunil Kavlekar with Pydhonie police station said: \u201cKhan\u2019s friend told him to be careful as the car picks up speed very quickly. Instead of slowing down, Khan accelerated saying he wanted to test the car\u2019s speed. The car shot ahead and hit five people sleeping on the pavement.\u201d\n\nKhan allegedly fled the scene, even as eyewitnesses informed the police about the incident.\n\nWhen a police team reached the spot to make inquiries, Khan, who is well-known in the area, was identified by eyewitnesses and a manhunt was launched to apprehend him.\n\nMr. Kavlekar said: \u201cThe injured were taken to J.J. Hospital. Meanwhile, Khan reached the hospital a short while later to get himself checked. Our team had received information during inquiries that he was on his way to the hospital and nabbed him there. He was subjected to medical tests and was not found to be drunk at the time of the incident. He has been charged with causing injury due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act.\u201d\n\nKhan was produced in a metropolitan magistrate\u2019s court on Friday and released on bail.",
