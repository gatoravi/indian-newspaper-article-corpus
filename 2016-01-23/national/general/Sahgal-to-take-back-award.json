    "text": "Nayantara Sahgal says she has decided to take back her Sahitya Akademi award as there is no provision to return it, and Nand Bhardwaj says that he respects the Akademi's condemnation of the killing of writers.\n\nCulture Ministry says nine other writers have agreed to follow suit\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi on Friday said that some of the writers, including Nayantara Sahgal, had agreed to take back the awards they had returned in protest against \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Sahitya Akademi has started sending back the awards to the writers... It has already been sent to Nayantara Sahgal. Another writer Nand Bhardwaj has also agreed to take back the award. It will be sent to other writers as well,\u201d Sahitya Akademi president Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari said.\n\nHe said the Akademi was also sending a copy of its resolution, which was passed in the October meeting, to all writers mentioning that there was no provision in its constitution to return the honours.\n\nAbout 40 writers had returned their awards in the past few months to the Sahitya Akademi in the backdrop of the Akademi\u2019s silence on the murder of fellow writer M.M. Kalburgi as well as against the \u201ccommunal\u201d atmosphere in the country following the Dadri lynching incident.\n\nOn October 23, the Sahitya Akademi passed a unanimous resolution appealing to State and Central governments to take steps to prevent such incidents and asked authors to take back the awards they had returned to protest against \u201crising intolerance\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Akademi strongly condemns the killing of writer Kalburgi and appeals to the State and Central governments to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future,\u201d Krishnaswamy Nachimuthu, an executive committee board member had said, after the nearly two-hour meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, a Culture Ministry source said, \u201cThere is a list of 10 writers who have agreed to take back the awards they had returned. Sahgal and Bhardwaj are two confirmed names on the list.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, Ms. Sahgal decided to take back her award as there was no provision to return the award, while Rajasthani writer Bhardwaj was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the response of the Akademi, condemning incidents of violence against writers.\n\nAfter agreeing to take back the Sahitya Akademi award that he returned, writer and former Doordarshan director Nand Bhardwaj, on Friday said the Akademi cannot be held responsible for the rising intolerance in the country.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Mr. Bhardwaj said: \u201cThe situation in the country was different when we returned the award. At that time writers and rationalists were being killed. [Kannada writer] Kalburgi was with the Sahitya Akademi and that is why so many award-winners objected to the Akademi\u2019s silence over his killing.\u201d\n\nMr. Bhardwaj, a Rajasthani and Hindi writer, said the Akademi held a meeting when the awards were being returned and condemned the killing. \u201cThe Akademi has stated that it would stand with the writers. I respect the Akademi\u2019s decisions. Intolerance and other issues remain, but now I wouldn\u2019t hold the Akademi responsible since that\u2019s not its mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nWelcomes decision\n\nMeanwhile, Culture and Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma welcomed the decision of the writers to take back the awards. \u201cThis is a welcome step,\u201d he told reporters when asked about the move by some of the writers. Asked about the number of writers who had agreed to take back the awards, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the number, but if the writers have decided to take back the awards, I welcome their decision.\u201d \u2014 PTI\n\n(With additional reporting by Kavita Upadhyay)",
