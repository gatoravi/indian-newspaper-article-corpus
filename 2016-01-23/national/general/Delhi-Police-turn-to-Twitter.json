Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi himself tweeted the message from his personal account.\n\nThe hijacking gains in prominence as only a couple of days ago a blue-beacon flashing SUV, belonging to a senior ITBP officer, was stolen outside his residence in Noida. The police\u2019s concern is that the two vehicles could be misused by terrorists.\n\nAfter this incident and the recent arrests of terror suspects by the NIA nationwide, the Delhi Police brass met at the India Gate lawns in the afternoon. The aim was protecting the vital installations in the city, with a special emphasis on those in New Delhi.",
