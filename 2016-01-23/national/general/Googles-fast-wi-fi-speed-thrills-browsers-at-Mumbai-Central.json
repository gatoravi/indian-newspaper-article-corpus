That\u2019s the speed at which you could browse the Web at Mumbai Central railway station for the first hour, and then depending on the number of users and time spent, the speed could vary between 50 Kbps and 1 Gbps. On Friday, Mumbai Central became the first of the country\u2019s 100 railway stations to be equipped with a high-speed wi-fi service, a collaboration between RailTel, the Indian Railways\u2019 telecom arm, and the US-headquartered software firm Google.\n\nThe ambitious project was announced last September during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, during his visit to India in December, had given a January deadline for the facility at the first station and, extending support to the Digital India initiative, had said that 100 railway stations will be covered by the end of 2016. The service was inaugurated by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.\n\nIn a statement, Railtel Chairman and Managing Director RK Bahuguna said the company\u2019s intent was to fulfil Railways\u2019 vision of providing passengers access to high speed internet. \u201cAffordable smartphones have made it possible for the common man to experience the power of Internet. With our partnership with Google, we are confident of rolling out a robust, scalable service at railway stations in the near future.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, Google South East Asia and India VP & Managing Director Rajan Anandan said: \u201cBy end of this year, over 10 million people will be able to enjoy this experience at 100 stations spread across the country.\u201d",
