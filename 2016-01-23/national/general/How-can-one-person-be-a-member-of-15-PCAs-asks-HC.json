    "text": "How can one person be appointed as member of 15 district police complaints authorities?\n\nThe High Court of Karnataka posed this question when the status report filed by the State government on the steps taken to make police complaints authorities (PCAs) functional in every district indicated that one Puttamadaiah, a retired public servant, has been appointed as member of 15 district PCAs.\n\nAlso, the status report disclosed that another retired public servant, Muniyallappa, has been appointed as member of nine district PCAs and another ex-public servant, G. Wali, as member of six district PCAs.\n\nIt is impossible for the PCAs to function effectively and hear the grievances of the public against the police with such kind of arrangements where one member will have to look after 15 districts, said Justice A.N. Venugopala Gowda",
