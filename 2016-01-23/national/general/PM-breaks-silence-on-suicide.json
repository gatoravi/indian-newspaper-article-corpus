What is true,\u201d asked All India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Surjewala.\n\nSignificantly, the Prime Minister\u2019s words came at the same time as HRD Minister Smriti Irani spoke to Vemula\u2019s mother and assured her of a judicial inquiry into the death of her son.\n\nBJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao who, during a Twitter chat on Thursday, questioned Vemula\u2019s identity as a Dalit, said: \u201cThe Central government\u2019s decision for a judicial commission on the Hyderabad University issue should be welcomed, shows government\u2019s sensitivity and accountability.\u201d\n\nSmriti Irani justifies suspension, Modi says I am pained; which is true,\n\nasks Congress",
