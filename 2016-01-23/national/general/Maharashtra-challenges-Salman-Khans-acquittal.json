At that time, the respondent was not having driving license. Not only that, he was under influence of liquor. The respondent, after the incident, ran away from the spot. Ravindra Patil, who was a police constable did his duty by registering a FIR in Bandra Police Station,\u201d the appeal said.\n\nIn December 2015, the High Court quashed an order by the Sessions Court convicting Mr. Khan for five years of rigorous imprisonment.
