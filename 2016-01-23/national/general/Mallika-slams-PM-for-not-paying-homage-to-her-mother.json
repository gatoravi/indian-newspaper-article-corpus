That has nothing to do with what Mrinalini Sarabhai did to promote the culture of this country to the world over sixty years,\u201d she posted on her Facebook.\n\n\u201cShe blazed a trail for our culture to the world. That her death sees no word from you shows your mentality. However much you hate me, as our PM, it behoves you to recognise her contribution. You have not. Shame on you.\u201d\n\n\u2018You hate my politics, I hate yours. That has nothing to do with what Mrinalini did\u2019",
