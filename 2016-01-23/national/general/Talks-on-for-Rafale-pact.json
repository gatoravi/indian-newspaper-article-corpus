Currently the cost per aircraft is above Euro 100 million which translates to about Rs. 800 crore along with the weapons package. In comparison a Sukhoi-30 MKI aircraft which India is assembling through technology transfer from Russia costs less than half, raising questions on the cost.\n\nA French team of government and Dassault officials has been in Delhi for the last few days carrying out talks with their Indian counterparts. In addition, Dassualt CEO Eric Tripper and other French defence industry heads are accompanying Mr. Hollande to India.\n\nSpeaking in Paris last week, French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian hoped that the deal could be concluded during the visit.",
