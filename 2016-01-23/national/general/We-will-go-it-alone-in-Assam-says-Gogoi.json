There will be no \u2018mahajoth\u2019,\u201d Mr. Gogoi said.\n\nBut he was quick to add that the party was talking to \u201clikeminded\u201d political outfits so as to establish an informal tie-up with a common goal to defeat the BJP.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding means vote for the Congress but not the BJP. Vote for the AGP but not for the BJP,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 73-year-old Congress veteran, who has been ruling Assam for the third consecutive term, met Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday. The purpose of the meeting, he said, was to discuss the election strategy.\n\nA senior Congress leader privy to the meeting told The Hindu that Mr. Gandhi expressed his concern to Mr. Gogoi over the BJP\u2019s rising influence in upper Assam, where several Congress workers who exerted strong influence in tea plantation districts had joined the BJP in the last few months.\n\nAt the press meet, Mr. Gogoi did recognise the BJP as his major political challenge, saying that the elections would be an open battle between him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \u201cIf you ask me individually, I am a good friend of Modi,\u201d said Mr. Gogoi. \u201cBut I will fight his policies and ideology.\u201d\n\nThough Mr. Gogoi acknowledges that the BJP has made significant gains in Assam, he said he \u201cwelcome[s] tough election.\u201d \u201cA tough election makes a man tougher,\u201d he said.\n\nRejecting the contention that anti-incumbency factor might hurt the Congress in Assam, he said such things only mattered if a ruling party failed to live up to the expectations of the people.\n\n\u201cWhatever little anti-incumbency is there, it will be overcome by our development work,\u201d he said.",
