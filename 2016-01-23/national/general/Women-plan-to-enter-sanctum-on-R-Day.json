According to the plan, Ms. Desai will alight from a helicopter to offer worship at the prohibited inner sanctum.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s demonstration, and its refusal to call it off, has discomfited the district authorities, which are worried about the effects of a possible backlash on Republic Day. The brigade has gathered 400 women.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong apprehension that the property might be in serious jeopardy if the Bhumata Brigade goes ahead with the demonstration,\u201d said Shivkumar Dighe, adding that the Shani Temple Trust comes under the Charity Commissioner\u2019s duties.\n\n\u201cWhile the Constitution accords every individual the right to protest, there is nothing constitutional about a gathering of 400 persons performing rituals at a temple which could offend locals and result in a fracas, causing possible damage to property. So, the Bhumata Brigade has been restrained from entering the prohibited, inner sanctum of the temple till further orders,\u201d Mr. Dighe said.\n\nThe Ahmednagar District Collector Anil Kawade has banned the assembly of people till February 4. The Bhumata Brigade\u2019s protest could coincide with political rallies around the area and give rise to a law and order situation, the order said.\n\nThe brigade, however, remains defiant.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared for these restrictions. We are planning to book a helicopter and are seeking permission for the flight from the Pune District Collector,\u201d said Ms Desai.\n\nThe Brigade\u2019s repeated assertion of breaching the inner sanctum has earned the resentment of tradition-bound locals, who perceive the outfit\u2019s actions as a mere \u201cpublicity-garnering stunt\u201d.\n\nBesides administrative objection, the brigade\u2019s plan has attracted strident opposition from the fringe-right, represented by the Sanatan Sanstha, the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS) and its women\u2019s wing, the Ranragini Shakha.\n\nBracing for a showdown with the brigade\u2019s activists, these organisations have mobilised 2,000 women to form a protective ring outside the temple in collusion with the locals of Shani Shingnapur village.\n\n\u201cWomen villagers at Shani Shingnapur have agreed to support us. If anyone tries to break the tradition, we will stop them with the help of police,\u201d said Monika Gawade of the Ranragini Shakha.",
