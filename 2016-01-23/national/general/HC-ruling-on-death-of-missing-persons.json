    "text": "The Madras High Court Bench here has held that a person missing for long and not heard of for over seven years could be presumed to have died under Section 108 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 only on the day after the completion of seven years. Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran passed the ruling while disagreeing with a view taken by a single judge of the HC that a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus conductor should be considered to have died on the date when he went missing in May 1999 for settlement of benefits to his legal heirs. \u201cThere is an inherent danger in presuming that the date from which a person went missing could be taken to be the date of death. If it is so taken, many claims that could be made by his legal heirs would become barred by time,\u201d the bench said.",
