But the terror we face in India is of cross-border nature, from Pakistan. That is why we need international collaboration so that financial channels and political supporters of state- sponsored terrorism can be dealt with by using the United Nations,\u201d said Gen. (retd.) Ved Prakash Malik, former Chief of the Army Staff.\n\n\u201cCollaboration with France on counter-terror will also help to bring in anti-terror resolutions at the United Nations and on other multilateral platforms in near future,\u201d he said, explaining that the armed counter-measures were not sufficient to deal with terror sponsors and terrorists as the global war on terror demanded a multi-layered strategy.\n\nLast year, India\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations spoke about the organisation\u2019s inability to give a \u201crobust\u201d response to international terrorism after the India-backed resolution against 26/11 plotter and LeT commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi failed to go through the Security Council because of Chinese opposition.\n\nGreater French support for India\u2019s decades-old anti-terror struggle would help India attain both regional as well as global targets in the fight against terrorism, Gen. Malik said.",
