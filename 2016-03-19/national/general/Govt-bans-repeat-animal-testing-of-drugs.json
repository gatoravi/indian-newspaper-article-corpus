    "text": "The Health Ministry, on Friday, banned repeat animal testing of new drugs already tested abroad, thus sparing thousands of animals.\n\nThe ban falls under the amendment Schedule Y, where the data on animal toxicity as per the specifications once submitted can be considered by the regulatory authority of the country which had earlier approved the drug.\n\nAfter the amendment, animal toxicity studies shall not be required to be conducted in India except in cases where there are specific concerns recorded in writing. Leading animal protection organisations, Human Society International and People for Animal (PFA) lauded the move.\n\nThis move comes after Women Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi wrote to the Health Ministry on the practice.",
