The event will end with an address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday evening.\n\nWhile the economic resolution is expected to deal with the budget and shower praises on it as \u201cpro-poor\u201d and \u201cpro-farmer,\u201d the political resolution will deal with a host of issues.\n\nIt is expected to attribute the propaganda against the government on \u201cintolerance\u201d and other such issues to the \u201cfrustration\u201d of the Opposition for having \u201cfailed\u201d to find real issues.",
