    "text": "The Hyderabad High Court on Friday quashed criminal proceedings against India Cements vice-chairman and managing director N. Srinivasan, who was arraigned as a co-accused by the CBI in a \u2018disproportionate assets\u2019 case against YSR Congress leader Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Justice B. Siva Shankara Rao allowed a petition by Mr. Srinivasan, who is also a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, and quashed the proceedings against him.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s main contention was that going by the records filed in court, it was the company, that is, India Cements, that had allegedly benefited from decisions of the government and Mr. Srinivasan himself was not a beneficiary in his personal capacity.\n\nThe allegation against Mr. Srinivasan was that his company had made investments to the tune of Rs. 140 crore in different firms linked to Mr. Reddy. In return, the CBI alleged, his company had obtained permission to draw additional water from the river Krishna for its cement manufacturing units, besides a mining lease in Kadapa district for 25 years from the erstwhile Congress regime in Andhra Pradesh. In his order, the judge considered the legal position that under the Indian Penal Code, there was no vicarious criminal liability, unlike the Negotiable Instruments Act, wherein company directors could be prosecuted for dishonour of cheques.\n\nThe judge took note of Mr. Srinivasan\u2019s contention that he was not a personal beneficiary of any of the government\u2019s decisions.",
