As the Speaker turned down their demand, they disrupted the proceedings and chanted anti-government slogans.\n\nMuch to the surprise of Congress leaders, former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna and Agriculture Minister Harak Singh Rawat joined the BJP leaders. Following that, Mr. Rawat and senior Congress leader Mantri Prasad Nithani reportedly exchanged fists.\n\nIn less than three months, after Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, Uttrakhand is the third Congress-ruled State that has plunged into political crisis because of rebellion stemming from within the party. So far, the party has lost power in Arunachal Pradesh after rebel Congress leader, Kalikho Pul, dislodged the Nabam Tuki government with the support of BJP legislators.\n\nThe disgruntled Congress leaders, led by Mr. Bahuguna, claim to have the support of 12 party MLAs in the 70 member-strong House.\n\nThe party high command in Delhi has called an emergency meeting for Saturday. Sources said Ambika Soni, party general secretary for Uttrakhand, is likely to visit the State on Sunday to meet the dissident leaders.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Kishore Upadhyay, PCC president in Uttrakhand, ruled out any threats to the government. \u201cWe will sort out the differences very soon,\u201d Mr. Upadhyay said. \u201cIt is too early to say the government is in danger.\u201d",
