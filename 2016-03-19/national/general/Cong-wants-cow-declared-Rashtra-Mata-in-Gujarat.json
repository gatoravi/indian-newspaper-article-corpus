    "text": "A day after a cow protector died by consuming pesticide in Rajkot, the Congress demanded that cow be declared \u201cRashtra Mata\u201d in Gujarat. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Shankarsinh Vaghela raised the issue in the House and asked the government why it did not concede the demands of the cow protectors and animal rights activists.\n\n\u201cThe BJP has been playing politics over cow for decades, but it is not at all interested in protecting cows, which are being slaughtered in the State. What prevents the BJP from declaring cow a \u2018Rashtra Mata\u2019 when it is in power in the State and at the Centre,\u201d he asked. \u201cEight persons consumed poison in the Collector office and one person died because the government had never conceded their demands,\u201d he said.",
