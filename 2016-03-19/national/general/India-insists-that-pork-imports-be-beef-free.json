Such animal feeds \u2014 including meat/bone/blood meal and hydrolysed intestinal tissues \u2014 are among the most cost-effective methods to hike protein levels in the diet of animals such as pigs.\n\nHowever, many Indian States prevent cow slaughter.\n\nNew Delhi has emphasised that if the US wants to export pork / pork products to India without trouble, all such consignments must come with an official veterinary certificate that the animal (pig in this case) was not fed with feed derived from cows / beef / beef products.",
