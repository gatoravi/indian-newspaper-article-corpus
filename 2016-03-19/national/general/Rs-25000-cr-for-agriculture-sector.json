This budget is dedicated to our farmers, who the government is committed to extending maximum support to, during this time of crisis,\u201d said Mr. Mungantiwar. His 90-minute speech was peppered with poetry dedicated to farmers, tribal people and women, with 27 minutes dedicated to outlining the State\u2019s agriculture strategy.\n\nThe Opposition blasted the budget as nothing but a smart \u2018jugglery\u2019 of numbers, which appears to be giving more to farmers but takes away a lot from the middle class. It alleged that the special allocation for the agriculture sector glosses over the government\u2019s mismanagement of the farm crisis.\n\n\u201cThe allocation hides the government\u2019s financial indiscipline and has nothing much to bring home for the farming community. The Rs. 25,000-crore number is just statistical jugglery,\u201d said senior Congress leader Ratnakar Mahajan. The budget, with an estimated revenue mobilisation of Rs. 2,20,810 crore as against revenue expenditure of Rs. 2,24,454 crore, turned out to be a reflection of the national budget, which too had focussed on irrigation and agriculture.\n\nFor the irrigation sector, Mr. Mungantiwar proposed an allocation of Rs. 7,850 crore against Rs. 7,272 crore in the previous year.\n\nTo make up for the jump in revenue deficit, the government proposed additional tax proposals worth Rs. 363 crore, which would directly and indirectly affect the middle class.\n\nThese include increasing entry tax on marble and granite, tea and coconut oil, and increasing VAT on all goods and services to 5.5 per cent (excluding declared goods) from 5 per cent.",
