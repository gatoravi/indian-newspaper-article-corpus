    "text": "Following the pattern of the Aadhaar Bill, the Congress anticipates that the BJP government may table the contentious Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill as the Money Bill after the constitutional amendments of the legislation are passed in the Upper House.\n\n\u201cAadhaar cannot be a money Bill but GST can be,\u201d said senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in a press conference. \u201cAfter making the constitutional amendments, they [the BJP government] may bring GST as money Bill in the Lok Sabha.\u201d\n\nMr. Ramesh said that by sidestepping the Rajya Sabha and passing the Aadhaar Bill in the Lok Sabha as money Bill, the BJP had violated the democratic tradition of discussing key legislation in Parliament.\n\nRejecting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley\u2019s remarks on the GST, he said a significant number of BJP leaders did not want to pass the reform law; therefore, the ruling party was trying to make the Congress the \u201cfall guy\u201d for its non-passage.\n\n\u201cGujarat is against GST, a large number of the trading community is against the GST. Many senior leaders of the BJP are against the GST,\u201d said Mr. Ramesh. \u201cSo, it is not clear to me what voice the BJP is speaking with but they are using the Congress as a convenient excuse to justify their own inaction.\u201d",
