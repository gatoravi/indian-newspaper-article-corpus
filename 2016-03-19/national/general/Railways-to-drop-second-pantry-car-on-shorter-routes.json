We will earn around Rs. 10 crore on each train by adding a passenger coach,\u201d said a Railway Ministry official, on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Rajdhani trains that will only have one pantry car instead of two will be: August Kranti Rajdhani (H. Nizamuddin-Mumbai Central), Mumbai Rajdhani, Patna Rajdhani, Ahmedabad Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Sealdah Rajdhani, Guwahati Rajdhani and Dibrugarh Rajdhani.\n\nAlso, passengers will have a choice to opt out of the meals provided to them on board the Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto trains at the time of booking the tickets.\n\n\u201cWe will earn around Rs. 10 crore on each train by adding a passenger coach\u201d",
