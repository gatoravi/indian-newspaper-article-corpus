Visitors then step in to the \u2018Sasan Gir Train Station\u2019, where an odd lion might be spotted snoozing on the tracks or roaming just metres away.\n\nThe new exhibit at the world\u2019s oldest scientific zoo will be home to four Asiatic lions and has been set up to simulate the vibrant setting of Sasan Gir in Gujarat in India \u2014 the last stronghold of Asiatic lions in the wild. Nine private cabins, each of which can accommodate two adults and two children, have been built at the exhibit where visitors can spend a night and view the lions at close range.\n\n\u201cZSL London Zoo is a magical place at night \u2014 we want people of all ages to have a chance to enjoy that magic, and immerse themselves in a fantastic experience unlike any other, sleeping near our magnificent Asiatic lions,\u201d said Emma Taylor, head of product development at London Zoo.\n\nThe four Asiatic lions housed at the exhibit are Heidi, Rubi, Indi \u2014 all females, and Bhanu \u2014 a male.\n\nThe 89-year-old Queen unveiled a large plaque to commemorate the opening on Thursday. Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was presented with a painting by Edward Lear circa 1835 of an Asian lion along with the publication The Maneless Lion of Gujarat . Industrialist Lord Swraj Paul, a patron of the zoo, said the lion exhibit will open to the public on March 25. \u2014 PTI",
