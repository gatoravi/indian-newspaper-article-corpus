The New Zealand government has backed the ambitious project.\n\nThe robot is just one-metre tall and is equipped with separate compartments to keep pizzas hot and drinks cold while travelling on the footpath \u201cat a safe speed\u201d from the store to the customer\u2019s door.\n\nThe robots use sensors to avoid obstacles. \u2014 PTI",
