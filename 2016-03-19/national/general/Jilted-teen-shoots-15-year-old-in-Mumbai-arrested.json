They exchanged numbers and stayed in touch after he went back to Rajasthan. Around two weeks ago, Saini came to Thane and was staying with the victim\u2019s family, and during this time, he allegedly told her that he liked her a lot and wanted to marry her. The victim rejected his proposal and asked him to never broach the subject again, which angered Saini, the police said.",
