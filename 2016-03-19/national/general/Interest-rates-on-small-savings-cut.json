While the interest rate on the KVP will be cut to 7.8 per cent from 8.7 per cent, that on post office savings is retained at 4 per cent. The rates on term deposits of durations varying from one to five years have been cut.\n\nThe five-year National Savings Certificates will earn interest at the rate of 8.1 per cent as against 8.5 per cent now.
