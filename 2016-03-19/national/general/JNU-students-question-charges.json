They have questioned the charges on the basis of which they have been held guilty. In a meeting of the JNUSU, we have decided that in our reply, we are going to question the composition of the committee and the outcome of the report,\u201d said Rama Naga, general secretary, JNUSU.\n\n\u201cLook at the process that has been followed by the committee. It did not even take the deposition of the students who were debarred. And, in its report, it says JNU students were not involved in anti-India sloganeering. If we were not involved in raising any objectionable slogans, why were we suspended for so long?\u201d Mr. Naga asked.\n\nThe students had refused to accept the committee\u2019s report, maintaining that their reply to the proctor\u2019s office would also be in accordance with that. A call of protest was also given by the JNUSU on Friday afternoon, opposing the enquiry committee.\n\n\u201cWhat are the charges on the basis of which we have been held guilty, since the report does not clarify anything in its findings,\u201d read the reply of a student.\n\nA meeting of the proctors was also held on Friday to discuss the replies. The quantum of punishment will be decided by the Chief Proctor on the basis of the replies and the recommendations submitted by the committee. The panel is believed to have recommended the rustication of Umar and Anirban and imposition of fines for the others.\n\nThe students served with show-cause notice were Kanhaiya Kumar, Rama Naga, Anirban Bhattacharya, Umar Khalid, Ashutosh Kumar, , Aishwarya Adhikari, Chintu Kumari and ABVP\u2019s Saurabh Sharma among others.",
