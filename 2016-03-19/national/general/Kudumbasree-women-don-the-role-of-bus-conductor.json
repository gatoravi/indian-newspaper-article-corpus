Private buses across Malappuram will now have women conductors, thanks to an initiative by the Regional Transport Authority meant to enhance public transport quality by empowering Kudumbasree women.\n\nThe first batch of 28 Kudumbasree women graduated on Friday after undergoing training in conductorship.\n\nThey looked confident and ebullient as they donned their new uniform at the passing-out function held at the District Panchayat.\n\n\u201cEmploying women as conductors in our private buses will be a revolutionary move. I believe it will enhance the quality of services offered by private buses in Malappuram,\u201d says Regional Transport Officer M.P. Ajit Kumar.\n\nKudumbasree units from other districts have evinced interest to replicate the idea there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it will go a long way in the empowerment of women,\u201d says Mr. Ajit Kumar.",
