After the announcement, Professor Mishra, who played an important role in forging the Congress-Left alliance in the State, withdrew from the electoral contest and wished success for Ms. Dasmunsi.\n\nThe other names on the list include Congress leader Amitava Chakraborty from the Shyampur constituency in Howrah, Abdul Mannan from Champdani in Hooghly district, and Sankar Singh from Ranahghat Uttar Paschim in Nadia district.\n\nThe Congress had earlier announced candidates for 43 seats, and with 42 names announced on Friday, the number of candidates in the fray increased to 85.\n\nThe party is likely to announce candidate for 10 more seats, which includes the prestigious Chowringhee constituency.",
