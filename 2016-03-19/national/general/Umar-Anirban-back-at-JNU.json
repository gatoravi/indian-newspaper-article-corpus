The police have claimed that some anti-national slogans were raised at the event, held in the varsity to oppose the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.\n\nThe court released both Mr. Khalid and Mr. Bhattacharya on their furnishing of a personal bond for Rs. 25,000 each with one surety. The court directed the two students not to leave the city without its permission during the bail period and to make themselves available before the investigating officer whenever required.\n\n\u201cThe case set up by the police qua co-accused Kanhaiya Kumar was also of organising as well as participating in the said event,\u201d the court said.\n\nIt also noted that the video footage of the February 9 incident had been sent to the forensic sciences laboratory and its analysis would take time. \u201cWhen all the aforesaid circumstances are weighed together and keeping in view that no previous criminal record has been alleged ... besides the ground of parity, I deem it appropriate to release both the accused on interim bail,\u201d said the judge.\n\nDefence counsel Trideep Pais argued that there was no violence before or after the event. Even the police had admitted that several videos of the incident, available in the public domain, were doctored.",
