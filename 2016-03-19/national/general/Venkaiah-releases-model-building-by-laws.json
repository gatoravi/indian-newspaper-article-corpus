    "text": "In an attempt to streamline new constructions with solar energy and environment-friendly modules, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Friday released a set of \u201cModel Building By-laws.\u201d\n\nThe law intends to create an online administrative process to ensure \u201csingle-window\u201d clearances of construction projects.\n\n\u201cThe highlight will be a complete elimination of human interaction of the applicant with the urban local body, including online approvals of various kinds of no-objection certificates. The time limit for all kind of building approvals is proposed in the model regulations to be 30 days maximum,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nOne of the interesting features is it mandates new buildings to have solar roof-top power generation.\n\nThe by-laws also provide for mandatory provisions for rain water harvesting for various types of buildings. This will be monitored by a special cell in each civic body.",
