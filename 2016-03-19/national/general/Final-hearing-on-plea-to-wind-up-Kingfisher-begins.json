    "text": "The Karnataka High Court on Friday began the final hearing of petitions filed by creditors, seeking winding up of Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KFL) and the Vijay Mallya-led UB (Holdings) Ltd., the promoter of KFL.\n\nJustice Aravind Kumar, who heard the arguments of counsel for BNP Paribas, a French Bank seeking winding up of UBHL to recover several crore used to finance KAL\u2019s purchase of three aircraft, adjourned the hearing to March 24.\n\nMeanwhile, counsel for the consortium of banks, led by State Bank of India, requested the judge to post the pleas for regular hearing as the court was hearing petitions related to the company matters only on Fridays. However, counsel for KFL and UBHL said there were enough interim orders in favour of the creditors from various courts and tribunals, and he needed sufficient time to put forth his arguments.\n\nThis was after the judge wanted to know from counsel for different parties the time they required for their arguments.\n\nFinally, the court said it would list the pleas for further hearing on March 24 and would decide on further course, including regular hearing.\n\nWhile a majority of the pleas were for winding up KFL and UBHL, a few pleas were in support of the companies.",
