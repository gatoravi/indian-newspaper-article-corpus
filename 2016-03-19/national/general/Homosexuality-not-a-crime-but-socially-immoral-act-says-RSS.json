    "text": "In back-to-back statements between Thursday and Friday, the RSS moved from saying that homosexuality was a personal matter and should not be a crime to calling it a psychological problem that should be treated and taking a stand against gay marriages.\n\nOn Friday morning, RSS joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale tweeted, \u201cHomosexuality is not a crime, but socially immoral act in our society. No need to punish, but to be treated as a psychological case.\u201d\n\nHe added in another tweet: \u201cGay marriage is Institutionalisation of homosexuality. It should be prohibited.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, Mr. Hosabale had taken what seemed like a soft line on homosexuality, saying in reply to a question at an India Today event that it be should not be considered a criminal offence.\n\nWhile the line that it should not be a crime stays \u2014 a gain in itself for voices seeking decriminalisation of homosexuality \u2014 there is a disapproval of homosexuality in the Friday tweets.\n\nIPC Section 377 criminalises sexual acts against the order of nature, and there has been much controversy over whether this should be so for acts between consenting adults. To a question on Thursday, Mr. Hosabale had said sexual preferences were a personal matter and the organisation did not hold any view on it. \u201cI don\u2019t think homosexuality should be considered a criminal offence as long as it does not affect others in society,\u201d he had said at the India Today Conclave.",
