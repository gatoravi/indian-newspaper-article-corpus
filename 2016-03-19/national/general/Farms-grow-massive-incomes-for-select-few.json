Notably, agricultural earnings are exempt from income tax.\n\nVijay Sharma, who filed the RTI application, has now moved the Patna High Court seeking further investigations into the matter, raising suspicion that income from undisclosed sources are being shown as agricultural income to evade tax.\n\n\u201cThe other possibility may be that illegal money or black money income is being laundered in a large scale and brought into the white economy. It requires deep investigation,\u201d Mr. Sharma told The Hindu . He said the next date of hearing on his public interest litigation plea was in April.\n\n\u201cI had got these details from the Income Tax Department through an RTI reply last April. Since then I have been writing to the Central Board of Direct Taxes seeking a probe into the matter. Till now, no agency has contradicted the information. In fact, in the Rajya Sabha, the Finance Minister on Tuesday also did not contradict the figures,\u201d said the 1976-batch IRS official.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Tuesday many prominent people were being investigated by the Income Tax Department for hiding taxable income as agricultural. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say it is political victimisation if names come out after that [probe],\u201d he said in reply to the questions raised by the Opposition members.\n\nThe Income Tax Department has launched an investigation on those reporting farm incomes of more than Rs. 1 crore a year. Official data peg this number at 307 in the assessment year 2015-16, up from 180 in 2007-08. The department is probing 2,746 such cases \u2014 Bengaluru recording the highest of 321 followed by Delhi with 275 and Kolkata with 239 cases \u2014 from across the country.\n\n\u201cAadhaar will help in this,\u201d Rajiv Kumar, senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, told The Hindu . \u201cNow you also really need to do digitisation of land records, and link them to individual identities. This agriculture income figure is completely spurious. It is due to people evading tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople earning more than Rs. 1 crore from agriculture should pay income tax. They will be an infinitesimal proportion of the total number of farmers, and the argument that the administrative cost of bringing these farmers into the tax net is too high will not apply to such a small number,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.\n\nThe IRS officer again filed an RTI application seeking access to details of top 100 assesses in the past five years. However, the Income-Tax Department refused to share the information, saying that it held the details in fiduciary capacity because the respective assesses have filed their returns along with financials under the Income Tax Act. The department said the disclosure of personal information was prohibited under Section 8 1(J) of the RTI Act.",
