Sreenivasa Murthy\n\nMiddle class consumers in Karnataka need to brace themselves for more expensive days as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah\u2019s budget levies more taxes on petrol and diesel, transport vehicles, soft drinks, beer, liquor, entertainment and cable services to mobilise revenue to fund populist schemes announced in his past budgets.\n\nWith no election round corner in the coming year, Mr. Siddaramaiah refrained from announcing new populist schemes in this budget. While the CII called it a \u201cwell-balanced budget\u201d, the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce described it as a \u201cmixed bag\u201d.\n\nKey proposals for the industry include reduction of VAT from 14.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent on some products produced by the small and medium industry. Proposals targeted at startups, the IT sector and to boost investor confidence also featured prominently.\n\nNot much of a boost for agriculture as there were no major schemes to address the rural distress in the backdrop of a spate of farmer suicides and drought situation in many parts of the State.\n\nHowever, the budget does bring relief to big farmers, planters of coffee, tea, rubber and other plantations crops as it abolished agricultural income tax.\n\nPresenting the fourth State budget of the ruling Congress, overall his 11th, in the Legislative Assembly here on Friday, the Chief Minister largely focussed on strengthening and expanding several populist schemes, which were announced three years ago after the Congress staged a comeback in May 2013 elections.\n\nBudget renders petrol, diesel,\n\nsoft drinks, liquor and entertainment costlier",
