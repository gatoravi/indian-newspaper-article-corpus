It will be a long battle. We have been given the bail. We will go on with our struggle to ensure that the sedition law is scrapped,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.\n\nKhalid and Bhattacharya, arrested last month on charges of sedition for their involvement in a controversial event organised to protest the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, were on Friday granted interim bail for six months by a Delhi court. \u201cI have been to jail. I know what it feels to be there. I am glad our comrades will be back but the struggle will continue,\u201d said Mr. Kumar.",
