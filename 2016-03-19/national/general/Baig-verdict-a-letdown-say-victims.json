    "text": "The Bombay High Court\u2019s verdict on Thursday, commuting the death penalty of Mirza Himayat Baig, convicted in the February 2010 German Bakery blast case, elicited sharply polarised responses from the victims and the kin of the accused.\n\n\u201cHe [Baig] ought to have been hanged a long time ago. It has been an arduous, and often, nerve-racking trial for all of us. All the same, we have to accept the court verdict,\u201d said Snehal Kharose, proprietor, German Bakery.\n\nSeventeen people were killed and 58 injured in the blast at the iconic eatery and the bakery underwent extensive renovation. \u201cIt was very hard on us in the immediate aftermath of the blast. We invested all of the compensation money [Rs. 14 lakh] apart from borrowing a sizable loan,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Madhu Agarwala, mother of Rajeev Agarwala, one of those killed, the memory of that fatal day will permanently be etched in her mind.\n\n\u201cI feel cheated by this verdict. My son, who was such a bright student with a promising future, will never return to me. So, why have they spared him [Baig]?\u201d she asked. Rajeev was a final year student at the Symbiosis Law College here. The college later instituted an award and a medal in his memory.\n\nOn the other side, for the kin of the prime accused, the long struggle to clear Baig\u2019s allegedly tarnished reputation has only begun.\n\n\u201cEvery charge against him is baseless\u2026all he wished to do in life was to teach. Now, he is embroiled in this anti-terrorism squad (ATS) plot to frame an innocent Muslim boy. It is utter rubbish when the investigators claim they found RDX in Himayat\u2019s home,\u201d said Tariq Baig, Himayat\u2019s brother.",
