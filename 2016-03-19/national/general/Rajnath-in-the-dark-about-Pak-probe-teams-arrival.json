    "text": "Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday he came to know about the arrival of an investigation team from Pakistan \u201cthrough the media\u201d and was awaiting External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj\u2019s return from Nepal to get further details.\n\nMr. Singh\u2019s statement elicited a sharp attack from the Opposition Congress party, which alleged a \u201clack of coordination in the government\u201d ahead of the visit of a joint investigation team (JIT) from Pakistan to investigate the terror attack in the Pathankot airbase.\n\nAsked about the Pakistan investigation team, Mr. Singh said, \u201cI have come to know through the media that the Pakistan team is coming. We are fully prepared. Let\u2019s wait for Sushmaji [Ms. Swaraj] to be back.\u201d\n\nSenior party spokesman Anand Sharma told reporters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have ensured coordination by convening a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security before Ms. Swaraj\u2019s visit to Pokhara in Nepal for the SAARC Foreign Ministers Meeting.\n\nThe announcement about the Pakistani team\u2019s visit had come after Ms. Swaraj\u2019s meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz in Pokhara on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere is no coordination in this Cabinet,\u201d Mr. Sharma said, adding that the Defence Minister, the Home Minister and his Minister of State were speaking in different voices. \u201cThe Home Minister is not aware of the JIT. The Defence Minister is saying a different thing,\u201d he said.\n\nSeeking to know the government\u2019s road map on Pakistan, Mr. Sharma said the Congress was not opposed to engagement with Islamabad. He, however, said Pakistan had not fulfilled its commitments in the wake of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.\n\nMr. Sharma wondered what understanding had been reached during the meeting of the NSAs of the two countries in Bangkok that convinced the Prime Minister to go to Lahore. Making a plea to take the Opposition leadership into confidence, Mr. Sharma said the Congress was justified in asking the Prime Minister what assurances convinced him to go ahead with the peace process.",
