    "text": "\u201cWill you get police from U.S. for Bengal polls?\u201d\n\nA day after the Election Commission issued transfer orders to 40 police and administrative officers in poll-bound West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday targeted the Commission, asking if it had faith in the State\u2019s police apparatus or would it call in forces \u201cfrom the United States?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me... if you don\u2019t have faith in Bengal\u2019s administrative system, then you ask (U.S. President Barack) Obama. He will supply police for you. Then you take them to the villages and see whether they are giving you votes or not,\u201d Ms. Banerjee thundered during a public meeting in north Bengal.\n\n\u201cWhat else do you want BJP,\u2026 CPI (M),\u201d a visibily angry Chief Minister said, also asking Opposition parties, \u201cWill the EC also help you get votes?\u201d\n\nThe transfer of officials comes after a full bench of the Commission visited the State and expressed concern over \u201csome laxity\u201d in the enforcement of the model code of conduct in certain areas and by some officials.\n\n\u201cThere is an elected government (here). Delhi is behaving as if Emergency has been imposed here... more than Emergency,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nDuring the 2014 Lok Sabha elections also, Ms. Banerjee had reacted strongly to such transfers and reinstated the officers after the polls.\n\n\u2018No objection\u2019\n\nMs. Banerjee however, said she did not have any objection to the transfers since \u201cwhoever will get the charge will be our people and the State\u2019s officers.\u201d\n\nMs Banerjee demanded that if State police were not to be used for the polls then the same norms should be used for all State Asselmbly elections. \u201cIn Delhi polls, the Delhi Police should not be used. I will see that day...,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trinamool Congress held a rally here protesting against \u201ccanards\u201d of the Opposition, particularly in the wake of a sting operation where a number of leaders of ruling party were allegedly exposed accepting cash from a fictitious firm.",
