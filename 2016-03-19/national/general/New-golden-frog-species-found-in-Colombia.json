Its discovery so close to a metropolitan area of nearly 10 million inhabitants illustrates how much of the planet\u2019s biodiversity remains to be discovered.\n\n\u201cWith this new species, Colombia now hosts 800 species of amphibians, second only to Brazil in total diversity,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe findings were described in the journal Amphibia-Reptilia . \u2014 IANS",
