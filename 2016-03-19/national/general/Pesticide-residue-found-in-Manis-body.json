    "text": "The laboratory tests of actor Kalabhavan Mani\u2019s internal organs have revealed the presence of pesticide residue.\n\nThe viscera report from the Regional Chemical Examiner\u2019s Laboratory, Kakkanad, has indicated the presence of Chlorpyrifose, a pesticide used in plants. The pesticide is used to increase the potency of spurious liquor, the report said.\n\nThe laboratory report also indicated the presence of methanol and ethanol content in the body of the Malayalam actor.\n\nKalabhavan Mani was admitted in an unconscious state to a private hospital in Kochi on March 5. He died on March 6.\n\nFollowing the release of the laboratory reports, Kalabhavan Mani\u2019s relatives have sought a high-level investigation into the actor\u2019s death.\n\nHis brother, R.L.V. Ramakrishnan, has demanded that a murder case be registered against the actor\u2019s friends who were with him at \u2018Paddy,\u2019 Mani\u2019s private farmhouse, on March 5.\n\n\u201cThe laboratory findings are shocking. There is some mystery behind the death. It is suspicious how the pesticide content and methanol were found in the body. Why was methanol content not found in any other person who consumed alcohol with him? Nobody is giving a convincing answer about what Mani had consumed. Doctors indicated that such pesticide content and methanol are usually found in hooch. Who gave him hooch?\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ramakrishnan alleged that Mani\u2019s friends used to give him alcohol even after his relatives had expressed their protest.\n\nRelatives seek expert investigation",
