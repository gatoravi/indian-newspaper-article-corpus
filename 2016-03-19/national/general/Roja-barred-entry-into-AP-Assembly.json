    "text": "On expected lines, YSR Congress Party MLA R.K. Roja was denied entry to the Assembly premises on Friday.\n\nThe interim orders given by a single judge of the Hyderabad High Court notwithstanding, security personnel at the Assembly refused to allow Ms. Roja into the Assembly. The security personnel stopped Ms. Roja at the Assembly gate initially, but allowed her later after she displayed the HC order.\n\nShe was, however, stopped from entering the YSRC legislature party office on the Assembly premises with Chief Marshal Ganesh refusing to accede to her request. Even as heated argument ensued between Ms. Roja and Mr. Ganesh, Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy entered the scene.\n\nHe reiterated the request to allow Ms. Roja into the Assembly based on the High Court order, but the Chief Marshal refused to heed it. The Opposition leader wanted the Chief Marshal to show the instructions in writing but the latter refused to do so.\n\nEnraged, Mr. Jagan led his team of MLAs to stage an impromptu dharna on the Assembly premises. Mr. Jagan tried to persuade the security personnel to allow Ms. Roja into the YSRC legislature party office at least, but his requests went in vain.",
