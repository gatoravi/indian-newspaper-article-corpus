We have urged the Commission that elections in Bengal should be held similar to the Bihar model,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said.\n\nThe Congress leaders also raised questions on the law and order situation in the State.\n\nSenior Trinamool leader and Education Minister Partha Chaterjee shot back saying, \u201cLaw and order is a state subject, not a subject of the Union Home Ministry.\u201d\n\nThe party cited extreme heat in April and May\n\nas the reason\n\nfor its demand",
