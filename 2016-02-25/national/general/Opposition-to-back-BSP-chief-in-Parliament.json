Raja. \u201cMayawati is not only a former CM of U.P. she is also one of the senior women politicians of the country.\u201d Several Congress leaders who\u2019re members of upper and lower Houses of Parliament echoed a similar sentiment.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu senior Congress leader B.K. Hariprasad said Ms.Irani should have \u201cwatched her language\u201d while addressing Mr. Mayawati.",
