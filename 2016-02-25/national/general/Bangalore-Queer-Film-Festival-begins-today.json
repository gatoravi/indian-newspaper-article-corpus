Meet the Pink Divas, a gender-bending group that will perform at the Bangalore Queer Film Festival, to be held in the city from Thursday to Sunday.\n\nManas, Varun, Pratik, Sagar, Saurav, Praveen, Harsh and Srinivas, all professionals who have been working in the city for years, form this group of \u201cmen who love to dance\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe underlying current is to break the gender stereotype,\u201d said Varun, a radiation safety engineer.\n\n\u201cIt kind of disturbs a few people, it questions them. We have got a lot of criticism for being there on stage. Even on a pro-LGBT stage like BQFF, there are people with internalised homophobia, disturbed by seeing men dance like women.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s first performance was in 2011 during Bengaluru Pride Week. The members have changed over the years. One of the \u2018senior\u2019 members of the group, Praveen, talks about the months of practice that goes before the main performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\nThursday: Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan\n\n6 p.m.: exhibition and performances\n\nFriday: Max Mueller Bhavan and Alliance Francaise\n\n10 a.m. to 10 p.m.: film screenings\n\nSaturday: Alliance Francaise\n\n9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.: film screenings\n\n5.30 p.m.: readings and performances\n\nSunday: Alliance Francaise\n\n9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.: screenings\n\n5.30 p.m. onwards: performances\n\nRead the rest of the report here.",
