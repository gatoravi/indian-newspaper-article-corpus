If you are not satisfied with my answer, I will cut my head and put it at your feet.\u201d\n\nIn response, Ms. Mayawati asked whether a Dalit member would be on the judicial committee.\n\n\u201cA Dalit professor was there whose decision you would not have accepted. You want to say, Mayawatiji, a Dalit is a Dalit only if Mayawatiji gives a certificate?\u201d Ms. Irani said.\n\nAngry exchanges took place between Ms. Irani and Ms. Mayawati amid the din.",
