His judicial custody expires on March 2. The police intend to seek his remand to confront him with the two JNU students.\n\nThe 13-page status report filed after the court\u2019s direction claimed that besides Kumar and other accused persons, some \u201cforeign\u201d elements were also present during the February 9 event and that they had covered their faces to \u201chide their identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investigating agency is looking for linkage between the petitioner, his co-accused and the said foreign elements,\u201d said the report, in which the police opposed Kumar\u2019s bail plea.\n\nThe report said the event held ramifications not only within India but also had an \u201cinternational impact\u201d and cited a raw unedited video footage as evidence. However, it added that the video footage was not the sole evidence on the basis of which the investigation was proceeding.\n\n\u2018Similar offence\u2019\n\nPolice alleged that Kumar, who had not cooperated during the interrogation, was likely to commit a similar offence if released on bail. The probe regarding the source of finances for all the activities that resulted in the alleged incident was ongoing and police were also examining the CCTV footage provided by the university, the report said.\n\n\u201cAfter the seditious act of the petitioner and the co-accused, the said anti-national perception has percolated to other parts of the country and there are stray instances wherein processions were taken out honouring the martyrdom of Afzal Guru, Maqbool Bhat (who was hanged in 1984), etc.\u201d said the report.\n\nPolice said they were conducting a probe regarding the persons and organisations which were behind such \u201cnon-educational activities\u201d in the campus and the object behind it in the larger national perspective.",
