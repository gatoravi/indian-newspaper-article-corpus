But how does this depravity get seeded in the minds of our children? Today I am compelled to say this \u2014 are these just slogans? I want to quote a Roman philosopher \u2014 a nation can survive its fools and the ambitious but cannot survive traitors,\u201d she said.\n\nShe situated her arguments squarely in the realm of \u201cnationalism\u201d and alleged \u201cbetrayal\u201d by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThe speech was preceded by a strong showing by the Opposition benches, with the chief whip of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Jyotiraditya Scindia accusing Ms. Irani and Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya of bringing down the might of the Indian government on Vemula\u2019s head just because \u201che opposed the ideology of the RSS and the BJP.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this government, it is either my way or the highway; anyone opposed to them gets branded as anti-national,\u201d Mr. Scindia said.\n\n\u201cA young student ends his life and senior Ministers in this government like Sushma Swarajji, Jual Oramji and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlotji only say the boy was not a Dalit. Is that the response of the government to the death of a son of poor parents,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThis government wants to muzzle the voice of JNU students. Why? Because they raised the issue of Dadri, they demonstrated in front of the Education Ministry over cuts in the allocation for the University Grants Commission, and they raised the death of Rohith Vemula,\u201d Mr. Scindia said.\n\nTathagat Satpathy of the Biju Janata Dal said it was neither the anti-national sloganeering by JNU students nor the Afzal Guru issue that the BJP cared about. The government wanted to divert attention from its failures on the economic front, he added.",
