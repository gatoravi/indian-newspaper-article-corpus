    "text": "The final hour of the last session of the 13th Kerala Legislative Assembly saw Chief Minister Oommen Chandy fervently protesting his innocence on the floor of the House.\n\nThere was a slight tremor in his voice when he faced the empty Opposition benches and emphatically stated, \u201cI do not want to go out shamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have not continued in office for a moment had there been an iota of truth in the slanderous allegations hurled against me. My conscience is clear. The prayers of the people and the unstinted support of my Cabinet, party and coalition saw me go forward in the face of such relentless attacks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe last session of the 13th Assembly would have been historic had it not been for the Opposition\u2019s strident positions. Their continuous boycotts and hollow sloganeering turned the session into something nobody would like to remember,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cmind numbing emptiness of the Opposition benches\u201d had rendered legislative business impossible, he said.\n\nThe CM said he was \u201claughing in my mind\u201d when the Opposition brought up the two-decade old palmolien import graft case against him in the Assembly again. \u201cThey were in power two times and it is their incapability that I still remain a witness in the case,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chandy\u2019s final speech as leader of the House was also a call to his supporters to prepare for the electoral battle ahead. \u201cWe are going to the people\u2019s court with a clear conscience. Let people sit in judgment of our government,\u201d he said.",
