    "text": "Influenza, commonly known as \u201cflu,\u201d can hide itself undetected in an individual\u2019s body by the person\u2019s immune system, reveals a study.\n\nThe influenza virus that affects mainly the nose, throat, bronchi and occasionally lungs contains a protein that helps in outsmarting the immune system \u2014 which can track viruses and alert the body of the entry of foreign virus into the human cells to multiply.\n\n\u201cThe virus contains a protein that masks the virus entering the cell. In this way, the influenza virus can spread more easily before the immune system recognises that it is a virus and attempts to fight it,\u201d said Christian Holm, associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark.\n\nThe little protein that is able to mask the influenza virus from the immune system can be used to combat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as the relatively rare disease lupus, which to a great extent affects young women, the researchers said in the study published in the scientific journal Nature Communications .\n\nIn these diseases, the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues and creates chronic inflammation.\n\n\u201cThe protein\u2019s immunosuppressant effect can possibly be used to develop better treatments for these types of diseases, where the immune system is chronically overactive. By suppressing the immune system\u2019s reaction, the symptoms can be reduced,\u201d added Mr. Holm. \u2014 IANS",
