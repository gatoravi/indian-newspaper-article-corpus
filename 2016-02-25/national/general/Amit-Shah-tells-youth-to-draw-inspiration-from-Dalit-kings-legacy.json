    "text": "BJP president Amit Shah on Wednesday urged the youth to follow the ideals of Dalit leader Raja Suhledev.\n\nOver the years, the BJP and the RSS have tried to portray Raja Suheldev, a Pasi king, as a Hindutva warrior who stopped the march of Muslim invader Ghazi Mian, a nephew of Mahmud Ghazni, in Bahraich and halted Islamisation of the region.\n\nAfter unveiling a statue of Suheldev and releasing a book on him, Mr. Shah urged the youth to take Suheldev as an \u201cinspiration\u201d and his conquest as a \u201cmessage\u201d on how the battle for independence could be fought.\n\n\u201cOnly those who take inspiration from their ancestors and carry on with their fight can make history,\u201d he said.",
