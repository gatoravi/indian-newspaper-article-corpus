The results could lead to a fundamental change in understanding relationship, as they sound a warning to the idea that couples can change each other over time.\n\nThe study found that people in relationships do not change each other over time. Instead, the evidence places new emphasis on the earliest moments of a relationship \u2014 showing that future friends or partners are already similar at the outset of their social connection.\n\n\u201cPicture two strangers striking up a conversation on a plane, or a couple on a blind date,\u201d said Angela Bahns from Wellesley College in U.S. \u201cFrom the very first moments of awkward banter, how similar the two people are is immediately and powerfully playing a role in future interactions. Will they connect? Or walk away? Those early recognitions of similarity are really consequential in that decision,\u201d said Ms. Bahns.\n\nWhether or not a relationship develops could depend on the level of similarity the two individuals share from the beginning . She added, \u201cThough the idea that partners influence each other is central in relationships research, we have identified a large domain in which friends show very little change \u2014 personality, attitudes and values, and a selection of socially-relevant behaviours.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . \u2014 PTI",
