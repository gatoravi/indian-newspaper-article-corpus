    "text": "Professor Virender Singh, a close aide of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, was booked on sedition charges on Wednesday for an audio clip of his conversation in which he had allegedly incited violence during the Jat reservation agitation.\n\nThe alleged clip featuring the voices of Mr. Singh and Captain Man Singh Dalal, spokesperson of Dalal Khap Chaurasi, surfaced on Monday after the Jat agitation turned violent. Though Mr. Singh conceded that the voice in the clip was his, he maintained that it was doctored. Mr. Singh said he had made an appeal for peace in the State, but that portion of the clip was edited out. He maintained that nowhere had he talked about instigating Jats or anyone.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the conversation is an old one, much before the current unrest started,\u201d he said.\n\nHaryana DGP Yash Pal Singal said the FIR against the two was registered on a complaint registered by one Pankaj Kumar, a Bhiwani resident.\n\nMr. Singal told media persons that the case was registered under various Sections of the IPC, including Sections 124-A (sedition) and Section 120-B (conspiracy).\n\nHe said if other \u201cconspirators\u201d were found, they too would be booked and action taken against them as per law for attempts to disturb peace in the State.\n\nHaryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar had already served a show-cause notice to Mr. Singh in connection with the audio clip. Mr. Singh was the political advisor to Mr. Hooda during Congress rule.",
