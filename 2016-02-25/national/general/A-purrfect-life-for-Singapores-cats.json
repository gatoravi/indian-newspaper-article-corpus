Room and board Sg$39 (Rs. 1900) per night\u2014 Photo: AFP\n\nCats who are tired of the rat race in fast-paced Singapore have a new high-end leisure option \u2014 a top-of-the-range hotel complete with designer beds, Roberto Cavalli wallpaper and Swarovski crystal-studded dining ware.\n\nThe Purrfection Suites are the ultimate in luxury for fussy felines looking for some quality downtime in the most upmarket surroundings.\n\nPurified air is pumped into every room, while some even boast classical music on a Sensurround system to help stressed cats unwind.\n\nThe 14-room extension \u2014 exclusively for cats \u2014 is part of The Wagington, Singapore\u2019s first five-star dog hotel housed in a converted British colonial-era bungalow in the heart of the city-state\u2019s diplomatic quarter.\n\nThe Wagington owner Estelle Tayler said since the opening of the dog hotel in 2014, cat owners have clamoured for a similar style of upmarket lodging for their pets.\n\n\u201cWe decided to make a wing dedicated just for our feline friends, with its own private entrance,\u201d Tayler said.\n\nApart from lodgings, the hotel offers grooming and spa services at additional cost. It plans to introduce \u201cin-room dining\u201d featuring home-cooked food. While their feline friends remain mostly indoors, The Wagington\u2019s doggy guests can frolic in the outdoor bone-shaped swimming pool and work up a sweat on treadmills.\n\nPets are a pampered lot in Singapore, one of Asia\u2019s richest cities. One businessman offers weekend boat cruises for pets and their owners. Pets also have their own obituary section in the country\u2019s leading English language newspaper. \u2014 AFP",
