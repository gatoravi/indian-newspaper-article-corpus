    "text": "A Christian organisation has sought a ban on the publication of a controversial book penned by Ganesh Savarkar, the brother of Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar, claiming Jesus Christ was a Tamil Hindu.\n\nThe book \u201cChrist Parichay\u201d is being re-launched 70 years after it was first published.\n\nThe United Christians Council, an NGO, on Wednesday asked Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to ensure the publication did not take place. \u201cThe contents of the book are defamatory and will evoke strong emotions in the community\u201d, it said in a letter. The book also claims that Christianity was initially a Hindu cult and that Jesus attained \u2018Samadhi\u2019 in Kashmir. \u2014 PTI",
