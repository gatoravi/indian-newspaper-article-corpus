Harpal Singh\n\nAn upcoming stone crusher-cum-hot mix plant located 200 metres away from the pristine Pochera waterfalls in Adilabad district of Telangana threatens to engulf the nature's wonder as well as the wild fauna in its vicinity.\n\nThe Revenue Department recently issued a no-objection certificate (NoC) to facilitate installation and operation of the highly-polluting stone crushing machinery and tar mixing unit. This was possible because the land located immediately next to the spot where the water falls is Revenue land.\n\nThe issue of NoC has the potential of opening flood gates for other players to arrive here, as the Pochera stream bed and the hillocks closeby have enormous deposits of black Deccan trap rock, used in the construction sector. \u201cIt is more a question of propriety than legality,\u201d observed Giridhar Deshpande of the Kuntala Samrakshana Samiti. \u201cEven if legal, the activity will result in noise and dust pollution, which will have a tremendous impact on the wildlife here, with the deer and monkeys nowhere to go,\u201d he said on Wednesday.\n\nA part of the stream and the huge pond at the foot of the waterfall are the only two watering holes within a few kilometres radius. The large population of wild ungulates, black buck, spotted deer and nilgais come to these spots to quench their thirst at night.\n\n\u201c\u201cTwo of these scared animals, which had entered our village, were killed by poachers in the last 10 days,\u201d a resident of Tejapur said.\n\nNoC issued for setting up stone crusher-cum-hot mix plant located just 200 metres away from the pristine waterfall",
