They want to fragment the country for their own interests.\u201d\n\nHe asked the Centre to engage Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. \u201cThere is no alternative to Indo-Pakistan peace. Kashmiris have the most to benefit from peace and dialogue between the two countries. Nothing has ever come out of violence and nothing will come out of violence in the future,\u201d Mr. Abdullah said.\n\nReferring to the composite Jammu and Kashmir, he said that people from various regions on both sides of the divide shared a common culture, language and heritage. \u201cWe should grant them the freedom to visit each other\u2019s lands and share common values and dreams.\u201d\n\nNational Conference working president Omar Abdullah said Delhi had dishonoured the terms and conditions of the State\u2019s accession to the Union of India and termed the erosion of the State\u2019s autonomy as a breach of faith that had manifested itself as political turmoil.\n\n\u201cOur flag is our pride. It represents all three regions of the State and we will protect our flag with our blood\u201d, he said.\n\nLashing out at the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. Omar Abdullah said, \u201cMehbooba Mufti\u2019s statement that she was neither capable nor prepared to take on the responsibility of leading the State is factually correct. That said, what is this prolonged delay about then? While the PDP and BJP continue to profess their unquestionable allegiance to each other and have adequate numbers, their refusal to form the government is strange. The people were happier under Governor\u2019s rule than they were under the PDP-BJP government. While the PDP promised political packages and economic revolutions in the State, it failed to deliver on a single promise.\u201d",
