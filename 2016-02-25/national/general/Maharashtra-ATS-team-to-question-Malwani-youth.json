    "text": "Nearly two weeks after the missing Malwani youth, Mohsin Sheikh, was arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell in an alleged terror plot, a team of officers from the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) will be leaving for Delhi this week to question him.\n\nMohsin, along with his friends Ayaz Sultan, Wajid Sheikh and Noor Mohammed, had gone missing last year. Ayaz was later confirmed to have joined the Islamic State in Kabul, while Wajid was traced to Pune, and Noor came back home on his own. Subsequently, intelligence and anti-terror agencies across the country arrested several suspected IS members from various locations in India, and Mohsin, who was the only one unaccounted for, was arrested during this sweep on February 5 this year by the Delhi Police.\n\n\u201cA team will be leaving for Delhi within two days to question Mohsin. He will be quizzed about his movements from the time that he went missing till the time of his arrest, as well as his interactions with the other three youths, with the other IS members arrested in the country and any contact he might have had with handlers operating from Syria,\u201d said an officer.\n\nOfficials said that the case with the Maharashtra ATS and the one with the Delhi Police are two separate ones. While the Maharashtra ATS is investigating Sultan\u2019s journey to Kabul and his joining the IS there, the Delhi Police have charged him with planning terror strikes inside the country. Sultan has already been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and UP native Rizwan Nawazuddin has also been arrested in the case.",
