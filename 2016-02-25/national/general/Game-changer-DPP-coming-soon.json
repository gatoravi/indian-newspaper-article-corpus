    "text": "The much anticipated Defence Procurement Policy 2016 is likely to be announced shortly with game-changing reforms that encourage greater role for Indian industry in military research and production. It aims to vastly reduce procedural delays, a top Air Force official said here on Tuesday.\n\nAir Marshal P.P. Reddy, Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Ministry of Defence, said DPP-2016 would pragmatically ensure fast procedures and 90 to 100 per cent government funding of research in public and private sector labs.\n\nHe was speaking at the fourth conference on electronic warfare hosted by DRDO and the Association of Old Crows.\n\nApart from focussing on design, development and manufacture of defence equipment within the country, it would provide \u201can unprecedented safety net to industry\u201d, he said.",
