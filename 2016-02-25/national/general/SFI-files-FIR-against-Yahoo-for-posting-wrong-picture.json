The student body had won majority of the elections in coalition with the All India Students Federation till the 1980s and registered victories contesting on its own since.\n\nHowever, the outfit faced competition for the first time in 1983 from the ABVP when the incumbent Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda shared the presidential post along with an SFI candidate when both secured equal number of votes.\n\nBoth the BJP and the Congress governments in power in the State had banned direct student elections in the university fearing violence.",
