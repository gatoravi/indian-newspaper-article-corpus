Over 200 persons, including a few security personnel, were also injured during the nine-day agitation.\n\nMr.Singhal said the sedition charges were in connection with an audio clip of Virender\u2019s conversation in which he allegedly incited violence.\n\nAn FIR has been registered in Rohtak against Virender and Man Singh Dalal, who also allegedly figured in the taped conversation, under various sections of the IPC.\n\nThey have also been charged with IPC Section 153-A (promoting enmity between classes) and Section 153-B (imputation, assertion prejudicial to national integration), he said.\n\nThe FIR against the duo was registered on the complaint of a Bhiwani resident, Pankaj Kumar, he said.\n\nVirender had earlier accepted that the voice in the clip was his but alleged that it had been \u201cdoctored\u201d. He has maintained that nowhere had he talked about instigating Jats or anyone. \u201cMoreover, the conversation is an old one, much before the current unrest started,\u201d he had said.\n\nCurfew lifted\n\nMeanwhile, curfew was lifted in Hisar district and relaxed in the violence-hit Rohtak and Bhiwani districts while rail and road traffic were resumed on routes which had remained blocked during the agitation. \u2014 PTI",
