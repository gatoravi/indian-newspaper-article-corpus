    "text": "Trial court judgment a brilliant analysis of anti-corruptionlaw, says senior advocate Dushyant Dave\n\nThe disproportionate assets case against Chief Minister Jayalalithaa cannot be viewed as a mere default in payment of Income Tax, but should be treated as corruption in public life, the Karnataka government said before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. About seven months after filing an appeal in the apex court, Karnataka began arguments against the State High Court\u2019s acquittal of the Chief Minister and three other co-accused \u2013 N. Sasikala Natarajan, V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarasi \u2013 in the wealth case.\n\nThe State government submitted before a Bench of Justices P.C. Ghose and Amitava Roy that Ms. Jayalalithaa created a veneer of \u201cconscientiousness\u201d by drawing Re.1 salary. \u201cOn the other side, tons of money are carried in suitcases to the banks by her cadre,\u201d senior advocate Dushyant Dave appearing for Karnataka submitted.\n\nSlamming the acquittal as a \u201cgross miscarriage of justice\u201d, Mr. Dave submitted that it had \u201cbecome a fashion for political leaders to term crores of money they get as birthday gifts\u201d. \u201cIt is unbelievable how such defence is taken up and accepted,\u201d Mr. Dave, who is assisted by Supreme Court advocate Joseph Aristotle, submitted. Special Prosecutor B.V. Acharya was present in the courtroom.\n\nTerming the trial court judgment as a \u201cbrilliant analysis\u201d of the anti-corruption law interpreted by the Supreme Court, the senior lawyer said, \u201cWe are looking into the sources of her income and not into whether she has accounted it for the five years (1991-1996). This is not an Income Tax matter, but corruption. The prosecution\u2019s version is that wealth amassed is completely, grossly mis-proportionate to any known sources of income\u201d.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, when Mr. Dave described the wedding of accused, V.N. Sudhakaran as the \u201cmarriage of the century\u201d. But Justice Ghose checked him.\n\nMr. Dave alleged how the accused continued to reside under the \u201csame roof\u201d with Ms. Jayalalithaa despite the fact that allegations of corruption were raised against them.\n\nKarnataka\u2019s appeal described the High Court judgment as \u201ccryptic, lacks reasoning and illogical\u201d.\n\n\u2018Trial court judgment a brilliant analysis of anti-corruption law\u2019",
