    "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused a plea by an NGO to subject intelligence agencies to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and other independent scrutiny.\n\n\u201cTrying to get into intelligence agencies can create a dent into our security,\u201d a Bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Shiva Kirti Singh told advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Centre for Public Interest Litigation.\n\nThe court refused to entertain the plea despite contentions raised by Mr. Bhushan that the intelligence agencies in the United Kingdom were put to independent audit of their accounts.\n\nThe NGO had raised a question mark over the functioning of the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing and National Technical Research Organisation on the ground that there was no statute to govern them. \u201cThe court should refrain from interfering in their functioning\u201d, the Bench remarked.",
