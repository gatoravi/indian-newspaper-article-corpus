    "text": "The Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court has adjourned the hearing on criminal contempt petition against noted author Arundhati Roy for four weeks as her plea challenging the proceedings is still pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nA Division Bench comprising justices Bhushan Gavai and Pradeep Deshmukh after hearing Ms. Roy\u2019s counsel on Monday, made it clear that as per the judicial propriety, they must wait for the outcome of the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the author, which is currently pending before the apex court.\n\nThe contempt notice was issued by High Court Justice Arun Chaudhari in December last for Ms. Roy\u2019s views published in a weekly magazine on the arrest of alleged naxal sympathiser and Delhi University professor G.N. Saibaba and subsequent rejection of his bail plea early last year.\n\nThe high court had observed that Roy\u2019s article was \u201cprima facie with a malafide intention to interfere in the administration of justice.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the apex court had refused to stay the criminal contempt notice issued by the High Court against Ms. Roy for the article.\n\nGadchiroli Police had arrested Saibaba in 2014 for his alleged links with Maoists. Ms. Roy sought exemption for personal appearance in her case.\n\nHowever, the apex court had refused to grant it and asked her to appear before High Court which exempted her from personal appearance during the last hearing. \u2014 PTI",
