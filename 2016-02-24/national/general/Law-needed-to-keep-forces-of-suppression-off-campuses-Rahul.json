    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday advocated a law that could keep the forces of \u201csuppression\u201d and \u201cdiscrimination\u201d under check on campuses.\n\nAddressing a gathering at Jantar Mantar in support of Rohith Vemula, the Hyderabad University Dalit scholar who committed suicide on January 17, Mr. Gandhi said, \u201cRohith talked about the future of India,\u201d \u201cbut the RSS [the BJP\u2019s ideological mentor] doesn\u2019t support that but only supports talking about the past.\u201d\n\nMr. Gandhi accused the BJP government of collaborating with the RSS and \u201ccrushing the voices of dissent\u201d of college and university students. To safeguard the voice of the student community nationwide, Mr. Gandhi called for a law, without naming the \u201cRohith Act.\u201d\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also came to the venue to express solidarity with Vemula\u2019s parents. Though he maintained silence over the JNU row, he squarely blamed the BJP government for \u201cpushing Rohith Vemula to suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Modi government seems to be at war with the students of the country,\u201d said Mr. Kejriwal.\n\nCPI(M) leader Brinda Karat, who was also present on the occasion, called Vemula\u2019s death an \u201cinstitutional murder.\u201d",
