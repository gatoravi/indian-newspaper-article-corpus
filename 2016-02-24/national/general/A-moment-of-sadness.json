It\u2019s a moment of sadness for the campus, because we have seen these activists for years standing with the students. However, they have placed their faith in the law and we hope that they will be released soon. We also hope that Comrade Kanhaiyya gets bail tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAccording to sources in the university, a group of students engaged media persons at the administration block, while others escorted the students when they boarded the G4 vehicle.",
