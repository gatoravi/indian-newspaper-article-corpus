Scores of artists, writers and scientists returned national honours in protest against what they said was a climate of growing intolerance\u201d.\n\nThe annual report said India held at least 3,200 prisoners in various prisons without trial under executive order. The report said the country had failed to prevent \u201chundreds\u201d of communal and ethnic riots in the past one year.\n\n\u201cSome politicians contributed to religious tensions by making speeches justifying discrimination and violence,\u201d said the report, while noting that incidents of non-vegetarianism and cow slaughter had often been cited as justification for communal and mob violence. It criticised India for a negative gender justice environment, and for violating international legal obligations for the recent modifications in the juvenile justice system which \u201callows children aged 16 to 18 to be treated as adults in cases of serious crimes\u201d.\n\nHowever, praising the collective spirit of resistance in India, the report also said \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d had faced tough opposition from the people who contested the majoritarian attempts to curtail freedom.\n\nThe report also made a special mention of Tripura, which was the first State to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.\n\nCensorship by hardline Hindu groups has grown, says Amnesty",
