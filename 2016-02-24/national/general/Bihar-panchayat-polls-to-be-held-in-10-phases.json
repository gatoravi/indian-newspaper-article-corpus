    "text": "The Bihar Cabinet on Tuesday approved the proposal to hold panchayat elections for 2.5 lakh posts in the State in 10 phases, from April 28 to May 30. The notification for the polls will be issued on February 28.\n\nRecently, the State government waived the rule that candidates should have toilets at home to be eligible to contest elections. The amendment to the Bihar Panchayat Act was welcomed by all mainstream political parties.\n\nOver 5.5 crore voters are eligible to cast their ballot in the polls.\n\nThe State had earlier announced that the panchayat elections would be held on non-party basis. In 2006, Bihar had become the first State to reserve 50 per cent seats for women in panchayat elections.",
