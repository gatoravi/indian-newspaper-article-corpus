    "text": "Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday asked Twitter to ensure that the social media platform was not abused for terrorism and extremism that posed a threat to India.\n\nTwitter said it recently suspended over one lakh accounts globally over such issues.\n\nHe also raised the issue of Jammu having been shown as part of Pakistan by the micro-blogging site at the first official meeting on Tuesday between the NDA government\u2019s brass and Twitter, represented by its Global Head for Public Policy Colin Crowell. In a faux pas earlier this month, Twitter\u2019s location tagging service showed Jammu as part of Pakistan, and Jammu and Kashmir in China.\n\n\u201cI formally communicated our deep sense of dismay and disapproval. A greater sensitivity needs to be shown by these platforms as far as our geographical identity and integrity is concerned,\u201d said Mr. Prasad.",
