    "text": "In his address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, President Pranab Mukherjee dwelt on the government\u2019s programmes, especially those aimed at financial inclusion and the agricultural sector, including the recently launched Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana.\n\n\u201cMy government has recently launched the farmer-friendly Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana, with the biggest-ever government\u2019s contribution to crop insurance, and with the lowest-ever premium rates for farmers. It has many firsts to its credit like national coverage of post-harvest losses due to inundation and unseasonal rains, no capping on subsidy and use of technology for early and accurate settlement of claims. Assistance to farmers affected by natural calamities has been increased by 50 per cent and eligibility norms have been relaxed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act to make it more stringent were on the anvil.\n\n\u201cWhile on the one hand, my government has taken measures to eliminate the scope for corruption, on the other, it has been unsparing in punishing those who are found guilty of corruption. Stringent amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act are also on the anvil to address the perceived gaps in the anti-corruption law,\u201d he said.",
