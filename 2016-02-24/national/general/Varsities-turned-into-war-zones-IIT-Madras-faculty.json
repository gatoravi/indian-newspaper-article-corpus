However, there is a deep distortion of the meaning of academic freedom which is leading to a vitiated atmosphere in the campuses,\u201d they said.\n\nThe faculty members have requested the President to take steps for saving educational institutions from the \u201cscholarship of abuse, hate and discord\u201d and restoring the atmosphere of sobriety, reflection and harmony necessary for genuine scholarship, Shreepad Karmalkar, a professor and one of the signatories, said in a statement.\u2014 PTI",
