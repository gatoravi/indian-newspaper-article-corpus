    "text": "U.S. artist's letter and drawing stored in a bottle found on a beach in France by a painter\n\nA message in a bottle dropped in New York harbour in 2013 by an American painter has been found years later, and 5,700 kilometres away, on a beach in southwest France by a French artist.\n\nGeorge Boorujy threw the bottle, containing a drawing of a cormorant and a signed letter into the harbour at Staten Island in October 2013, regional French newspaper Sud Ouest reported.\n\nIt washed up two-and-a-half years later on a beach in the Aquitaine region of France where it was found last week by Brigitte Barthelemy, a painter, and her husband Alain who were out walking their dog Elton.\n\nMr. Barthelemy was intrigued by the perfectly preserved drawing and the letter congratulating the finders of the bottle and jokingly asking that they did not respond with another letter in a bottle, a \u201cvery inefficient\u201d means of communication.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Boorujy gave his email address in the letter, so Brigitte was able to make contact by more modern means.\n\nSmall world\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the email from Alain and Brigitte, I was amazed and crazy with excitement,\u201d the French newspaper quoted the American as saying. \u201cAnd the fact that Brigitte is also a painter is extraordinary,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Boorujy hopes his bottle will help raise awareness about the protection of wild birds. \u2014 AFP\n\nThe bottle sent by an American painter was picked up by an artist and her husband",
