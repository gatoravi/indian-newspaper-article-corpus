Pandit was posted in Srinagar as the personal security officer for former Public Works Department Minister and PDP leader Altaf Bukhari. The constable fled with two service rifles to join the Hizbul Mujahideen.\n\nMany PDP leaders admit that the party\u2019s failure to deliver on the political and development fronts was costing it the \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201chard-earned\u201d constituency in south Kashmir.\n\nPDP youth president Waheed Parra said, \u201cI myself am shocked over the way the Pulwama youth is behaving. It\u2019s unusual for the party. It\u2019s true the youth voted for change and the peace process. However, we have hit a dead-end in the past nine months on taking any political measures or working towards any reconciliation. People have huge expectations from the PDP on many counts, including the continuation of the peace process\u201d.\n\nA local resident said, \u201cPulwama has become a springboard for militancy. There is anxiety among the youth after the BJP-PDP government was formed\u201d.",
