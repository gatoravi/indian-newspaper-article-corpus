What we are asking them to investigate is the role of their people in their country,\u201d Mr. Parrikar said.\n\nMr. Parrikar\u2019s comments were in line with the thinking in the military circles.\n\n\u201cWhat do you gain by letting them enter the base?\u201d asked a senior Air Force officer. \u201cIt is a forward airbase specifically meant for Pakistan operations, and what is the guarantee that after the visit they wouldn\u2019t claim there is no evidence in Pathankot that terrorists from Pakistan were behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a stupid idea,\u201d said a just retired Air Marshal. \u201cWhat would a Pakistani team find in Pathankot that our investigators have not figured out. They should have faith in our investigation agencies, and accept what we have to offer. In that sense, permitting them into Pathankot is a vote of no confidence on Indian agencies.\u201d\n\nOpposing the move, former Navy Chief Admiral Sushil Kumar said, \u201cWhen you allow a person who is inimical to your interest you are setting a wrong precedent.\u201d \u201cIt could all be farcical, their double-crossing instincts are well known,\u201d he said, charging that the latest flare-up in violence in Kashmir was a sign that the Pakistan deep state was at work against India.\n\nAdmiral Kumar said the main problem is that we still do not know who is calling the shots in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cYou may think you are dealing with a harmless government, but it may not be because it could be a mere puppet,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Delhi seems to be happy about the progress made in Pakistan over the Pathankot attack investigation.\n\nSartaj Aziz, adviser to Pakistan Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, said in an interview that the SIT would need access to some parts of Pathankot airbase as part of their investigation. He also claimed that Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar had been under police custody since January 14, information that Indian officials were not confirming.",
