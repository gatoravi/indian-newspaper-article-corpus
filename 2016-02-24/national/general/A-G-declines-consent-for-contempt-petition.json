    "text": "Petition seeks contempt proceedings against Kanhaiya Kumar, and others\n\nAttorney-General Mukul Rohatgi declined consent to a petition seeking the Supreme Court to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and research scholar Umar Khalid, former Delhi University lecturer S.A.R Geelani, among others, for allegedly terming the execution of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru a \u201cjudicial killing\u201d.\n\nUnder Rule 3 (c) of the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court, 1975, a petition filed by a third person alleging contempt should receive prior consent of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General in writing before the court takes action. This screening is part of a mechanism to avoid wasting the court\u2019s time on frivolous contempt pleas.\n\n\u201cI have declined consent. I gave no reasons,\u201d Mr. Rohatgi told The Hindu on Tuesday.\n\nThis contempt petition was mentioned before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur last Friday.\n\nThe Attorney-General\u2019s refusal on February 22 coincides with the start of the Budget session. The Opposition and the Left parties are expected to take up the JNU row and question the way the government is dealing with it.\n\nAlso, the refusal comes at a time when the government and the Delhi Police are gearing up to fight tooth and nail Mr. Kumar\u2019s bail before the Delhi High Court on Wednesday. Mr. Kumar is facing trial for sedition for his alleged involvement in raising anti-national slogans.",
