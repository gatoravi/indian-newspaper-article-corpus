    "text": "Expressing their support to the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), over 200 students and a few faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) staged a protest walk on their campus on Tuesday evening. Many of the teaching staff who took part in the protest are said to have studied at JNU.\n\nMeanwhile, a \u201cletter of solidarity for JNU from members of the IIT Madras faculty\u201d, with over 50 signatories, has been sent to the President, who is also the Visitor of the JNU.\n\nIn the letter, the IIT Madras faculty expressed serious concern over the recent events at JNU and in the national capital over the past week.\n\n\u201cThese events indicate the imposition of a narrow definition of nationalism by the state that excludes the possibility of dissent. A democracy is nothing without the ability to both question and disagree. Our university spaces have always fostered this space for debate and disagreement, and always in a fashion that encourages respectful co-existence through difference. As we view these spaces being criminalised and violently curbed, we are concerned that we are no longer able to foster spaces for open democracy,\u201d the letter said.",
