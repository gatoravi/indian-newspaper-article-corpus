Chandrababu Naidu will not ditch my community for the second time. With lot of hope and faith in the elected government, I withdrew my stir. I appealed to the State government to send Justice Manjunath Commission to tour East Godavari district to get factual details on the status of poor Kapu families.\u201d",
