The company had raised crores from different lenders and had also issued cheques for repayment.\n\nThe complainant in the case, Smita Shroff, had invested Rs. 45 lakh in the company and in lieu of repayment, the company had allegedly issued a cheque of Rs. 57,61,838. But the cheque bounced and she filed a criminal complaint under Section 138 (dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc, of funds in the account) and Section 141 (offences by companies) of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the company and all its directors.",
