    "text": "A luxury commode custom-built for a Thai princess\u2019s visit to Cambodia was left unused despite its hefty $40,000 price tag, local officials said on Tuesday, in a poor country where the majority of rural dwellers do not have access to a toilet.\n\nThe convenience was built for a visit on Monday by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to Yeak Lom lake in northeastern Cambodia.\n\nBut her two-hour visit ended without her ever having experienced the lavish water closet, community leader Ven Churk said. The toilet was later \u201cremoved\u201d and the adjoining bathroom will now be turned into a security post for tourists visiting the tree-ringed lake, he added.\n\n\u201cShe (the Princess) did not go inside the bathroom, she just looked at it from outside and took some pictures,\u201d he said. The toilet took more than two weeks to build and cost an estimated $40,000, Mr. Ven Churk said.\n\nProvincial governor Nhem Sam Oeun confirmed the toilet was unused, adding the facility is \u201cvery modern, very good... it can\u2019t be kept because it is for royals.\u201d\n\nThe Thai side covered the construction costs, he added.\n\nLocal media reports said the luxury pan was built by the Siam Cement Group, a Thai construction giant partly owned by the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the Thai royal family\u2019s assets and investments.\n\nWhile the pricey privy has made international headlines it has not received any media attention in Thailand, where a severe \u2018lese majeste\u2019 law punishes any perceived criticism of the royal family with up to 15 years prison. UNICEF figures say 61.5 per cent of Cambodians living in rural areas defecate in the open as they have no access to latrines. \u2014 AFP",
