    "text": "Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said science and technology if not rightly used, can become a danger to society.\n\n\u201cWorld over there is a concern for cyber crime. The importance of technology has increased so much for good governance and development,\u201d he said.\n\nTo buttress his point, Mr Singh drew a contrast between the youths working in IT giant Infosys and terror outfit al-Qaeda, saying while one was working in the interest of society, the other was for its destruction.\n\n\u201cI read a write-up in The Guardian newspaper published from London which was on Infosys versus al-Qaeda,\u201d he said at a convocation function of APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University here. \u201cWhile one can be termed as a creative talent for the human society, the other belonging to al-Qaeda is destructive talent...one is beneficial for society while the other is destructive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Union Minister said \u201cit will have to be seen as to how the difference in thinking has emerged... talent cannot be used in a proper manner for the betterment of society unless thinking is right and there is also commitment for human values.\u201d\n\nWhile at one time big companies were confined to countries like the US, \u201ctoday we are proud that we are not behind anyone. Even the heads of Google and Microsoft are of Indian origin.\u201d \u2014 PTI\n\nHe drew a contrast between youths working in IT giant Infosys and terror outfit al-Qaeda",
