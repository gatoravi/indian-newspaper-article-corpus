    "text": "The release of 100 declassified files on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Saturday may not help the BJP in concrete terms in poll-bound West Bengal as it has hardly any presence there.\n\nThis apart, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already scored a political point months ago by releasing the files with the State government.\n\nAnother tacit political point made by the Union government is that it is seeking to do justice to the memory of Bose by declassifying documents that the Congress governments held on to tightly. Faced with the main rival Congress claiming the legacy of the freedom struggle, the present regime, observers and critics say, is looking to appropriate the legacies of freedom fighters other than Nehru by suggesting that the Congress sought to erase them.\n\nThe documents made public by the Prime Minister include 36 files of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, 18 files of the Ministry of Home Affairs and 46 files from the Ministry of External Affairs from the period 1956 to 2003. These can be accessed on www.netajipapers.gov.in or seen by the public at the National Archives till February 15, 2016.\n\nBy declassifying documents that Congress held on to, Modi is scoring a political point",
