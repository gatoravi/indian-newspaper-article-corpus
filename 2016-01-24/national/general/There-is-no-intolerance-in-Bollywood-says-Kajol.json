    "text": "Choosing to play down the intolerance debate in India, actor Kajol on Saturday said there are no such dividing lines in Bollywood.\n\n\u201cOur industry will always keep reflecting on what is happening in our society. It will keep on going and everyone is welcome. There are no dividing lines, no caste, no creed and no intolerance in Bollywood,\u201d she said on the third day of the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival.\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar, a close friend of Ms. Kajol, had kicked up a storm with his remarks about freedom of expression being the biggest joke in the country on the inaugural day of the festival.\n\nIn recent months, actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan have landed in controversy for speaking up against the \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d in the country.\n\nMs. Kajol, who has worked with both Shah Rukh and Aamir, refused to react to the backlash faced by the PK star, whose controversial remarks had evoked criticism from many quarters.\n\n\u201cThese days, people seem to have become oversensitive. As public personalities it is our duty to speak well and correctly. I have always said my \u2018Mann ki baat\u2019 and it is no different now,\u201d she said.\n\nA voracious reader, Ms. Kajol, who was at the JLF to launch author Ashwin Sanghi\u2019s new book, The Sialkot Saga , said she agreed to marry Ajay Devgn because he promised her a library similar to the one in the Hollywood film Beauty and the Beast . \u201cI told my husband that I\u2019ll marry you only if you give me the Beauty and the Beast library. That was our love deal,\u201d she said at the cover launch of Mr. Sanghi\u2019s book. \u2014 PTI",
