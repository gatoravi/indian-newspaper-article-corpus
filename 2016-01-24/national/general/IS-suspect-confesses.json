More if he wanted to say anything on his arrest, Khan said \u201cMujhse galti ho gayi sir\u201d (I have made a mistake sir).\n\nAdvocate Shabnam Shaikh, appearing for Khan, alleged that the businessman, who was reportedly in touch with Mudabbir Sheikh, the ring leader of the group, had been framed in the case. \u201cHe made his confession under pressure. He has been falsely implicated,\u201d she said.\n\nKhan\u2019s second wife, also present in the court, pleaded that her husband was innocent. She said he had lost his father several years ago and had the financial responsibility of three families.\n\nAs the news of his arrest reached the family, Khan\u2019s family and well-wishers rushed to the court.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Khan\u2019s wife, unwilling to disclose her name, said the family was shocked to know of his arrest, they were informed of, after 12 hours.\n\nHe was detained by the NIA and the ATS on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWe are clueless about why he has been arrested but are sure that he is innocent,\u201d she said. As for his \u2018confession\u2019, his wife said he might have done it under duress.",
