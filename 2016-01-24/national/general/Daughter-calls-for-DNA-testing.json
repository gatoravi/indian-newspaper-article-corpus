The crash happened three days before Japan capitulated, at a time of great upheaval and uncertainty,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Pfaff says that DNA samples could be taken from the remains of the bones buried in the temple.\n\n\u201cIt could be that they are not my father\u2019s, but that still does not necessarily disprove the theory that he died in an air crash.\u201d\n\nShe says that she personally wrote to the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh twice requesting that the Indian government initiate the process with the Japanese government, but received no response.\n\nOn the political crossfire in India over the declassification, Ms Pfaff said that the issue may well become ammunition for parties, especially in the context of elections in West Bengal this year, \u201cbut declassification was long overdue and had to be done\u201d.\n\nAshis Ray, a London-based journalist who has uploaded the evidence of the last days of Bose on his site www.bosefiles.info, has welcomed the declassification, while supporting the demand for DNA testing.\n\nOn the letter written by Nehru to British PM Clement Attlee calling Bose a \u201cwar criminal\u201d, Mr. Ray said that Nehru \u201cnever wrote such a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was fabricated by mischievous pro-Bose anti-Nehru elements on Calcutta,\u201d he told The Hindu .\n\nOn Bose\u2019s controversial alliance with the Nazis, Ms. Pfaff says, \u201cHe had no choice.\u201d",
