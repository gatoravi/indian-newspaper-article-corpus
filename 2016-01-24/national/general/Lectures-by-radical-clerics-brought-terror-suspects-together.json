Two mosques in north Bengaluru turned the platform for many such bayan s, claimed NIA sources.\n\nAsif Ali, a stone polisher arrested from J.J. Nagar, worked to organise bayans by Maulana Anzarshah Qasmi, a radical preacher from Banashankari, who was recently arrested for his links with Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).\n\nIt was at these bayan s that Syed Mujahid Hussein from Tumakuru, Mohammed Afzal from Saraipalya, and Abdul Ahad were believed to have met.\n\nHussein had also organised a bayan by Ansarshah Qasmi in Tumakuru in November 2015, sources claimed.\n\nThe group, however, grew distant from Ansarshah Qasmi, as he was opposed to Islamic State (IS), the suspects are said to have told interrogators.\n\nThey later organised a bayan by one Mufti Abdus Sami Qasmi, another allegedly pro-IS cleric from Uttar Pradesh, sources claimed. Mohammed Abdul Ahad turned into a rallying point for the group.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the group held two meetings \u2014 in Bengaluru and in a forest area in Tumakuru \u2014 in the past three months.\n\nThey also claimed that the meeting held in the city was attended by Muddabir Mushtaq Sheik from Mumbra, Mumbai and Mohammed Nafeez Khan from Hyderabad.\n\nNIA claimed to have also recovered explosives from the two.",
