The Finance Ministry agreed to the proposal, and Netaji\u2019s nephew Amiya Nath Bose was informed of the same.\n\nAs for the daughter, Anita Bose, now Anita Pfaff, it was decided to set up a Trust \u2014 with Nehru and then West Bengal Chief Minister B.C. Roy as the trustees \u2014 with the amount to be transferred to her when she turned 21.\n\nIn case of her death by then, this transfer would happen to her mother, and if both had died, to the Congress, as per a document dated April 15, 1954. Nehru confirmed the execution of \u201ca trust deed in favour of Subhas Chandra Bose\u2019s child in Vienna\u201d in a letter on May 23, 1954. The deed was placed in the custody of the All India Congress Committee. As for the sum to be paid to Bose\u2019s widow, the Finance and the External Affairs Ministries had suggested \u00a3100 to be sent for the \u2018widow\u2019 Frau Schenkl \u201cthrough private channels, to our Vice-Consul at Vienna, who should disburse it\u2026\u201d\n\nA 1966 letter says that while the AICC paid Anita Bose until her marriage in 1965, Bose\u2019s widow declined to accept any money.",
