New Delhi is forcing the police to curb the rights of Kashmiris,\u201d said Mr. Rahid, who represents Langate in north Kashmir.\n\nThe BJP demanded action after the brawl took place in Pulwama district of south Kashmir two days ago. The MLA allegedly threatened a BJP supporter after he objected to the depiction of Mr. Modi in a banner, which read \u201cMr. Modi stop terrorising Muslims.\u201d",
