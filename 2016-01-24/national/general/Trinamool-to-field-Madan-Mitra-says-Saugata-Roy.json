He criticised Mr. Roy for making such \u201coffhanded\u201d remarks and pointed out that his comments do not reflect the party\u2019s view.\n\nAddressing a party workers\u2019 meeting at Belgharia in North 24 Parganas district, Mr. Roy said: \u201cMadan [Mitra] will once again be our candidate from Kamarhati. This is the decision of our party. You have to work with the aim of getting him re-elected,\u201d he told party workers amid loud cheers.\n\nMr. Roy also assured them that if they remain on the \u201cright track\u201d Mr. Mitra will definitely win.\n\nRecently, while being produced in court, Mr. Mitra said that he will abide by the party\u2019s decision with regard to contesting the Assembly polls.",
