Taslimuddin, is the JD(U) MLA from Jokihat in Araria district.\n\nOn January 18, an FIR was filed against him for \u201cmisbehaving with and molesting a couple\u201d travelling on the Rajdhani Express from Dibrugarh to New Delhi.\n\nIndrapal Singh Bedi and his wife had lodged a complaint against him with the Railway Police.\n\nHowever, the MLA denied the charges and said he was not even travelling on the train that day. But the police gathered sufficient evidence and summoned him for questioning on Saturday evening. Mr. Alam complied with the summons.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Nitish Kumar hinted at action against the MLA. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Mr. Alam contacted his office on January 18 and he was given time to meet him on January 19 but he did not turn up. \u201cThen I realised there was something fishy.\u201d\n\nAsked about another controversial party MLA from Rupauli, Bima Bharti, and the party MP from Purnea, Santosh Kushwaha, who had allegedly helped gangster Awadhesh Mandal (Ms. Bharti\u2019s husband) flee from police custody at the Maranga police station in Purnea recently, Mr. Singh said: \u201cNobody will be spared\u2026 Once the administrative report on their role comes in, the party will act against them if they are found guilty.\u201d",
