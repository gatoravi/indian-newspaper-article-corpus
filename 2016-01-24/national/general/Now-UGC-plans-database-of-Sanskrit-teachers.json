    "text": "The Centre\u2019s push for the development of Sanskrit teaching and learning is apparently not limited to primary education. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has now asked universities, where Sanskrit is being taught, to submit details of faculty engaged in teaching the language for a proposed database which will be used for a scheme being devised to promote Sanskrit.\n\nThe database will be used to coordinate the work of the universities, the letter to the Vice-Chancellors and Directors of 126 institutions says. Not only this, the instructional materials and literature used in teaching and research in Sanskrit are expected to be uploaded on \u2018Bharatvani,\u2019 the web portal launched by the Ministry of Human Resource Development to disseminate knowledge about languages in India.\n\nProfessors of Sanskrit say propagating Sanskrit language will eliminate the need to read ancient works through translations. The number of students learning the language too is fairly steady, said Radhakrishna U. from Bangalore University\u2019s Sanskrit Department.\n\nOthers were guarded in their reason to promote the language. M.R.N. Murthy, Professor of Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, said the purpose behind the push for Sanskrit is important.\n\n\u201cSanskrit hasn\u2019t been in use for more than 2,000 years. Sanskrit as a source of historical knowledge is good. It is important that history is not forgotten. But the purpose for which Sanskrit is being pushed for is also important. Not every common man needs to know Sanskrit, but they should have some knowledge of our history. But there should be some scholars,\u201d he said.",
