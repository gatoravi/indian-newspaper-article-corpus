    "text": "Serbian hermit inherits fortune, gives it away\n\nAn elderly hermit living in a mud hut in the Serbian mountains inherited a fortune from her estranged husband in Australia \u2014 but swiftly gave it all away to live off her meagre pension, local media reported.\n\nMarija Zlatic, 86, who lives two hours from the nearest village in eastern Serbia, recently received $660,000 bequeathed by her husband who died there in 2011, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper said this week.\n\nBut Ms. Zlatic has given all of her newfound wealth to people from the village who look after her, bringing food, water and wood. \u201cWhere I am going soon I do not need money, so I gave it away. They need it more. I am fine with my $70 monthly pension,\u201d Ms. Zlatic told the daily.\n\nMs. Zlatic and her husband Momcilo left for Australia in 1956 where he worked as a carpenter, but she came back less than two years later to take care of her sick mother and never returned. Ms. Zlatic\u2019s husband made his fortune through cattle farming. \u2014 AFP",
