She was balletic and masterly. When done, Ms. Kondo received a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cLook at her, she\u2019s adorable,\u201d said Rita Wade, 51, a director of student affairs at a language centre who said that she was in attendance because she was fascinated by Ms. Kondo\u2019s global reach.\n\nThe elfin Ms. Kondo, perhaps the world\u2019s only decluttering celebrity, was promoting her new book, \u201cSpark Joy,\u201d a more prescriptive manual (it comes with illustrations) than her last, which is a publishing juggernaut. (Both titles are at the top of The New York Times best-seller list.)\n\nKindly and self-mocking, Ms. Kondo was already a tidy freak, as she said (assisted by an interpreter), by age 5, irritating her family by throwing away their belongings and mystifying her teachers when she skipped recess to organize her classroom\u2019s bookshelves. Now 31, KonMari, as she\u2019s known, exhorts you to ask yourself, \u201cDo your things spark joy?\u201d If not, you must thank them for their service, and send them packing.\n\nIt\u2019s a liberating manifesto, though in practice it can take months. (This reporter once lost an entire weekend to the KonMari method.) Handle each object to properly gauge whether it truly thrills. Kondo suggests giving your clothes a hug, and mimed doing so as the audience gently applauded.\n\nHer approach to stuff isn\u2019t just minimalism, said Yuko DeYoung, 50, an account manager at a news agency, and one of more than 100 attendees at the book signing. \u201cHer method is something more basic, something more \u2026\u201d DeYoung paused to find the right word, \u201c\u2026 humane.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this patting and hugging of belongings, a kind of compassionate organising, has resonated beyond all reckoning.\n\nMore than 5 million copies of Ms. Kondo\u2019s books have been sold, along with licenses to print them in 40 languages, including Mongolian. Fox and NBC are working on a sitcom inspired by her.\n\nLast year, Time magazine named Ms. Kondo one of its 100 most influential people, in an encomium by the actor Jamie Lee Curtis, who proclaimed her devotion to Ms. Kondo by announcing that if she ever got a tattoo, it would say, \u201cSpark Joy!\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic analysed Ms. Kondo\u2019s tidying method through the lens of behavioural economics. Consignment stores have been overwhelmed by donations from devotees.\n\nInevitably, there was a backlash, and then a backlash against the backlash. Finally, a parody appeared that wasn\u2019t quite parody: \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a [expletive],\u201d by Sarah Knight, out last month, was mostly practical. \u201cSo many books are about hoarding and clutter,\u201d said Christian Freedom, 46. \u201cIt\u2019s very shaming. I like her tone and her idea that untidiness is a spectrum.\u201d\n\nMr. Freedom was at Barnes & Noble with a friend, Darren Rosenblum, also 46, who had given him the book for Christmas, and they were disputing their place on that spectrum.\n\nMr. Freedom said he had already filled a large duffel bag with castoffs, delivered to a thrift store. \u201cI thanked my stuff and handed it off,\u201d he said. \u201cMy therapist was really happy and said, \u2018Can you do that twice a week?'\u201d \u2014 New York Times News Service",
