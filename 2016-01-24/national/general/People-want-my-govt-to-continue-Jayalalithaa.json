They wanted an improvement in law and order, life conditions of the deprived classes, farmers, fishermen, weavers and other suppressed and oppressed classes and voted for change.\n\n\u201cWe have fulfilled the aspirations of the people and improved their life,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa said, reiterating her oft-repeated line that she and her government were there only for the people.\n\n\u201cMy government is because of the people and my government is for the people.\u201d\n\nTaking a jibe at those asking why she was reading out a prepared speech, the Chief Minister said she could speak extempore for hours and thunder in classical Tamil as at public meetings. \u201cThere are 36 departments. Even if I list out my government\u2019s achievements during the last five years, it will take a day for each department. My reply will take 36 days and the Assembly has to sit for 36 days,\u201d Ms. Jayalalithaa said, adding that it was with great difficulty that she had condensed her government\u2019s achievements in all sectors into a 90-minute speech.\n\nThe main Opposition parties, the DMDK and DMK, stayed away from the Assembly proceedings.\n\n\u2018If I list out my govt\u2019s achievements in the last 5 years, it will take a day for each dept.\u2019",
