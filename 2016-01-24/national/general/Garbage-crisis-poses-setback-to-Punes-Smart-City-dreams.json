    "text": "Two decades ago, the fields were verdant and mornings were quiet. Residents of the twin villages of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi, barely 20 km outside Pune, a fight for clean air seemed absurd.\n\nToday, overflowing garbage near the two villages has become visual shorthand for the city\u2019s chimerical dream to transform itself into a \u2018Smart City\u2019 by 2016.\n\nSince 1991, the villages have faced the brunt of Pune\u2019s surging consumerism, with the problem of solid waste disposal blowing to monstrous proportions. In 1981, the Maharashtra government allotted 43 acres of land in Uruli and provisioned another 120 acres of land in Phursungi in 2003 to meet Pune\u2019s waste-disposal demand.\n\nThe ongoing crisis has brought into sharp focus an already deepening urban-rural divide in Pune district. While methane emissions from the landfills permeate the air, the villagers have been subjected to a litany of maladies owing to pollution of their water sources.\n\n\u201cThe dream of a \u2018Smart Pune\u2019 seems hopelessly unreal given that a daily 500 tonne of waste still lies untreated in the dumps of Phursungi and Uruli Devachi,\u201d said activist Dilip Mehta, a resident of Phursungi.\n\nPMC figures show that Pune generated around 300 tonne garbage daily in 1991. This has now ratcheted to nearly 1,700 tonne.\n\nTo compound the problem, corruption is rampant in the PMC-run waste disposal plants set up by Hanjer Biotech at Uruli Devachi, which was shut down in December last year.\n\nDespite a waste-treating capacity of 1,000 tonne, the decrepit plants were barely able to process 200 tonne of waste.",
