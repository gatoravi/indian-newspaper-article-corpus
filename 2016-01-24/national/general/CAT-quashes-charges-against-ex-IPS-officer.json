Nanavati, Mr. Sharma submitted the CDs, which were taken on record as evidence by the commission.\n\nThe Bench came down heavily on the State administration for issuing a charge sheet to the officer, who as per the court, aided the cause of truth.\n\n\u201cThe charge sheet is illegal, coloured by arbitrariness, tainted by mischief and malice as the actual result of suppression of the mobile tracking records in the CD is to benefit the actual perpetrators of brutal and violent crimes through which hundreds of innocents died needless and violent deaths,\u201d the Bench observed in its order, blaming the State authorities of trying to suppress the CDs that contained vital information regarding the ghastly riots.\n\nTo the Gujarat government\u2019s allegation that the tribunal was biased towards Mr. Sharma, the Bench made a scathing observation. \u201cBias in the sense of conviction in moral and ethical values is not only unavoidable during judicial determination, but also desirable as otherwise the blood that made red the streets and by lanes of Gujarat would have gone in vain.\u201d\n\nTook VRS\n\nHounded by a series of charge sheets and show cause notices, Mr. Sharma took voluntary retirement from the service and is now a practising lawyer in Gujarat High Court.",
