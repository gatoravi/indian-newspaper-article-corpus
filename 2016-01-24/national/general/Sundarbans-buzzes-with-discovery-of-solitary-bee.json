What makes it distinct from other species of solitary bees is the different patterns of the marks on its face and frontal region.\n\nThe 96 species of bees of the genus Braunsapis do not make combs as common honeybees do. Solitary in nature, they nest in stems and twigs independently.\n\n\u201cWe have collected the specimen of the species, a holotype male from Dabanki in the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve. The specimen was described by Rajiv K. Gupta, an expert in bees and Professor of Zoology at Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur,\u201d Gaurav Sharma, scientist at the Zoological Survey of India, told The Hindu .\n\nThe findings were published recently in the Journal of Environment and Bio-sciences . The new species plays a significant role in pollination.",
