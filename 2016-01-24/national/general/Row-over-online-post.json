It is not the first time students got suspended\u2026 but it is the first time we are seeing a big nationwide drama.\u201d The post was also critical of the \u201canti-BJP groups\u201d which were silent when other suicides had occurred. \u201c\u2026Many students of this university are influenced by radical Left ideologies, but they never mounted such a feisty campaign when those Dalit students took their lives,\u201d the post said.\n\nThe post blamed the Congress and the CPI(M) for \u201cplaying with Dalit students sentiments\u201d.",
