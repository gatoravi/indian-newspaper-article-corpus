Sources said Ms. Mufti is now planning to hold a feedback session with the lower rung party cadre to \u201cunderstand how this nine-month coalition was playing out on the ground for the party\u2019s image.\u201d\n\n\u2018I will take my time\u2019\n\nThe fresh direction has come after Ms. Mufti, mandated to take the final call, made it clear to the party leaders that \u201cshe wants to have her conscience clear first on the continuation of the coalition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will take my time. I will go by Mufti sahib\u2019s decision only if I feel that I can fulfil his dreams,\u201d Ms. Mufti was quoted by party leaders as telling a closed-door meeting five days ago.\n\n\u201cEven if the doable in the Agenda of Alliance cannot be achieved, what should be the PDP motivation to continue,\u201d Ms. Mufti reportedly asked.\n\nVisibility of the late Mufti\u2019s son, Tasaduq Mufti, a cinematographer by profession, has increased at the party meetings, where he had started showing interest in\u201capolitical issues like urban development and ecology,\u201d according to party sources. Talking to The Hindu , the State-level BJP leaders said, \u201cThe PDP is yet to fulfil the constitutional obligation of meeting the Governor for continuation of the coalition.\u201d\n\nMs. Mufti move to play hardball has the BJP leadership in New Delhi weighing its options in the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority State.\n\nAfter the former Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed\u2019s demise on January 7, there was visible cozying up of the Congress to the PDP \u2014 leaders Sonia Gandhi, Ambika Soni and Ghulam Nabi Azad were seen standing next to the mourning Mehbooba. Similarly, regional player National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah also dropped hints at \u201ckeeping the options open.\u201d",
