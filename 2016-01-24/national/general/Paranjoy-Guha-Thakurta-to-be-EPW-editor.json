    "text": "The Sameeksha Trust, which runs the Economic and Political Weekly has appointed senior journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta editor of the journal from April 1. This follows the resignation of Rammanohar Reddy from the post early this month.\n\nThe EPW , headquartered in Mumbai, is widely recognised as a unique journal-cum-magazine that combines popular commentary with academic research articles in the social sciences.\n\nMr, Thakurta will be only the fifth editor of the journal, which began initially in 1949 as the Economic Weekly edited by Sachin Chaudhuri and adopted the present name in 1966. An independent journalist, he is well known for his commentary on India\u2019s political economy.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , Mr. Thakurta said he was keen on \u201ctaking forward the steps taken by Dr. Reddy in strengthening the academic aspects of the EPW , while reaching out to the youth and newer audiences \u2026 \u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the Trustees, Deepak Nayyar (Chairman), D.N. Ghosh (Managing Trustee), Andre Beteille, Romila Thapar, Jean Dreze and Rajeev Bhargav, \u201crecorded their deep appreciation\u201d for the work done by Dr. Reddy and his \u201cenormous contribution\u201d.\n\nDr. Reddy, who had been the editor for 11 years after previously working with The Hindu as economics editor, was due to retire in April, but resigned early. The early resignation was due to differences between the editor and the Trust board members on issues related to editorial autonomy. In particular, Dr. Reddy\u2019s efforts to bring out a documentary to commemorate the 50th year of the journal\u2019s existence through external funding had come under the Trust\u2019s questioning.\n\nDr. Reddy\u2019s resignation had spurred 101 long-standing contributors and readers of the EPW to urge the Trust\u2019s members to involve the outgoing editor in the search for his replacement and to continue the activities planned for the anniversary.\n\nThe Trust\u2019s statement says that it is willing to \u201corganise a consultation with persons from the wider EPW community\u201d on the anniversary celebrations, \u201cin consultation with the editor-designate\u201d.",
