The same standards will apply retroactively to current members.\n\nThose who do not qualify for active status will not be able to vote.\n\nTo increase diversity on the board of governors immediately, the Academy said it would establish three new governor seats that will be nominated by the president for three-year terms and confirmed by the board.\n\nIt will also involve new members on decisions about membership and governance, giving them a chance to become more active in decision-making and to help spot and nurture future leaders.\n\nThe announcement was quickly welcomed by Ava DuVernay, director of civil rights movie Selma , which was nominated for best picture last year, but not for best director or actor. \u2014 AFP",
