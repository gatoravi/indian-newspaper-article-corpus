    "text": "Excise and Ports Minister K. Babu, who tendered his resignation here on Saturday, called the directive of the vigilance court in Thrissur to file an FIR against him in the bar bribery case extraordinary, as it came just when the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) Director had sought another month\u2019s time to file the quick verification report on him.\n\n\u201cI have yet to receive a copy of the order, but as soon as I heard about it in the media, I conveyed to the Chief Minister my desire to step down. There was no pressure on me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed to be a \u2018martyr\u2019 in the \u2018conspiracy\u2019 allegedly hatched by the CPI(M) and some bar owners, affected by the government\u2019s policy to reduce liquor consumption by closing down bars and liquor outlets in phases.\n\n\u201cTheir mobile tower locations that day will reveal this. The allegation against me was the outcome of the conspiracy. Why did the liquor baron choose not to name me on several previous occasions, including in a statement he furnished before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure? Moreover, he has not been able to put a date on which the bribe was given.\u201d\n\nAlleging a secret pact between bar owners and the CPI(M), Mr. Babu challenged the Left parties to spell out their stance on the liquor policy in their manifesto for the coming Assembly polls.\n\nThe case apart, he was content with his performance as Excise Minister \u2014 a portfolio he hesitated to accept \u2014 and exuded confidence in coming out clean in the case.\n\n\u201cI have had an unblemished public life. I am indebted to the electors of Tripunithura for reposing their faith in me in five Assembly elections,\u201d he said.",
