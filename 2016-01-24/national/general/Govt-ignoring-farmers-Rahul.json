    "text": "Undertakes padayatra of drought-hit areas of Bundelkhand\n\nCongress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday accused the Narendra Modi-led government of ignoring the interests of farmers in favour of corporate houses.\n\nTouring drought-hit areas of Bundelkhand, Mr. Gandhi urged Mr. Modi to think of the poor, the backward and labourers.\n\n\u201cIf you do not listen to their voice and understand the true power of the unemployed youth and the poor, you will face heavy damage,\u201d he added. Under the Modi-government, \u201cweaker sections are being oppressed,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said.\n\nPadhyatra\n\n\u201cBe it a farmer in Bundelkhand or a Dalit youth in Hyderabad. Whenever you see a weak oppressed, you will find the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi,\u201d Mr. Gandhi told farmers after a 7-km padhyatra in Mahoba district, at the centre of the agrarian crisis. The leader also interacted with women self-help groups.\n\nWith a little more than a year left to the 2017 Assembly elections, Mr. Gandhi\u2019s padhyatra is understood to be part of the Congress\u2019 outreach towards the poor and farmers. Bundelkhand has been Mr. Gandhi\u2019s favourite playing field.\n\n\u201cI have come here to draw the attention of PM Modi and CM Akhilesh to Bundelkhand and the problems of the farmers,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said.\n\nHe listed steps taken by the UPA government for the benefit of farmers and the poor, especially the employment guarantee scheme MGNREGS, and how it had checked drought-induced migration.\n\nEver since the Samajwadi Party government announced drought in 51 districts of the State, politics over Bundelkhand\u2019s agrarian crisis has caught pace, with the Opposition parties targeting the State government for the plight of farmers.\n\nTo beat the crisis, the State has suspended all revenue collection till March 31.",
