They are operating at several levels, and Armar is one of the links here. We have reasonable information that Armar is based in Syria and is getting directions from the Islamic State to rope in men here,\u201d the official said.\n\nUnder surveillance\n\nAsked what led to the crackdown because the groups were under surveillance for the last seven-eight months, a senior official said: \u201cTheir communication with each other precipitated the arrests. Since they have procured the explosives, it was imperative to arrest them.\u201d",
