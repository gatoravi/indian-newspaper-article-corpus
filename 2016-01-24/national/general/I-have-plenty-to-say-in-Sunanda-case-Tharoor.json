    "text": "Days after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report concluded that the death of Sunanda Pushkar was due to poisoning, her husband and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said that he has \u201cplenty\u201d to say on the case but would await the ongoing probe to end.\n\n\u201cLet me say this for the last time, I will not comment on this matter, as a matter of policy as well as principle, until the police have concluded investigation,\u201d Mr. Tharoor said on the sidelines of the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival here. \u201cOnce the police have done so, come to a conclusion and presented it to a court, I will have plenty to say. But till then it will be wrong to do so and I will not do so,\u201d he said.\n\nIn January last year, the Delhi Police had registered a case of murder in connection with the death of Sunanada. An All India Institute of Medical Science medical board had found poisoning as the reason for her death following which the police had sent her viscera samples to an FBI lab in Washington last year. The AIIMS medical board gave its opinion based on the FBI report that Sunanda died of \u201cpoisoning.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
