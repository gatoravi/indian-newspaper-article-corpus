It should be inherent and natural. But these things are to be told these days because we have people [the students] who told not to say this [ Bharat Mata Ki Jay ]. Such people are more visible today and it is time for us to think about it,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to the arrest of some JNU students for allegedly raising anti-national slogans.",
