The release of the documentary at the Sara City Mall, Srinagar, was disallowed by the authorities on March 2.\n\nTerming it \u201cundemocratic and dictatorial,\u201d Mr. Farooq said: \u201cBy using suppressive measures, the government was stifling the right to freedom of expression of Kashmiris.\u201d\n\nHolding the film\u2019s screening (which was allowed on Thursday) before a limited audience at the APHC headquarters, the Mirwaiz said: \u201cThe government was not even allowing peaceful activities of the Hurriyat leadership by continuing to abort their programmes. Disallowing the screening of the documentary was another such instance of strong-arm tactics of the government.\u201d",
