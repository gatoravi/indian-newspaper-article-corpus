'With more than 150 works by Ms. Mohamedi on display, the exhibition brings to an international audience more than three decades of her work, comprising her oil paintings, collages, drawings in ink and graphite, watercolours and photographs. The exhibition will be held at The Met Breuer, the new location for The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s contemporary art programme, opening to the public on March 18.\n\n\u201cMohamedi rarely theorised or spoke about her work but documented her internal dialogue in a form of soliloquy, in tiny personal diaries and notebooks, some of which will be on display in the exhibition. The exhibition explores the conceptual complexity and visual subtlety that made her practice unique in its time,\u201d the museum said. Kiran Nadar said, \u201cThe museum\u2019s mandate is also focused on artists whose practice is yet to receive desiring attention and critical acclaim. We believe that their stories need to be told.\u201d\n\nMs. Mohamedi was born in 1937 in Karachi and her family moved to Bombay in 1944. The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Director and CEO Thomas Campbell said Ms. Mohamedi\u2019s work calls on \u201cus to expand our understanding of graphic minimalism in a transnational context. It is a project that speaks to our interest in introducing a broad range of audiences to the innovative work created by artists across borders\u201d. \u2014 PTI\n\nNasreen Mohamedi\u2019s art is on display at the inaugural exhibition of The Met Breuer",
