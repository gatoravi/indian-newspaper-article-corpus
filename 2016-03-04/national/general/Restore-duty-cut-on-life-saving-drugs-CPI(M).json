These drugs include anti-cancer, anti-AIDS drugs and drugs for haemophilia patients.\u201d Demanding that the government reconsider the decision, the party said, \u201cThe government\u2019s reasoning is that this would protect the domestic drug companies. Now the prices of life saving drugs for patients dependent on imported drugs will rise by at least 22 per cent.\u201d",
