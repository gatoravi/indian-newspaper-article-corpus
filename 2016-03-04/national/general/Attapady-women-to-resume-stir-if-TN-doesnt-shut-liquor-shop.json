    "text": "The tribal women\u2019s collective Thaykula Sanghom, in Attappady, said it would resume its agitation after one month if the Kerala authorities failed to prompt their Tamil Nadu counterparts to shift the liquor shop across the border at Anaikatti.\n\nOn Wednesday, they decided to put a temporary halt to their fortnight-long agitation.\n\nSanghom leader Maruthi said that Palakkad Collector P. Marikutty had assured them she would talk to her Coimbatore counterpart Archana Patnaik to speed up the process of closing down the liquor shop. Tamil Nadu had sought one month to shut down the shop, according to Ms. Marikutty.\n\n\u201cIf they do not shift the shop within one month, we will lay siege to it,\u201d Maruthi said.\n\nThe agitation, involving over 300 women from Attappady, won wide attention when they blocked traffic on the Mannarkkad-Attappady-Coimbatore route several times.\n\nAlmost all political parties and social organisations in Kerala and Tamil Nadu had extended support to them.\n\n\u201cThe Collector said the government was not in a position to provide police security to the agitation as the Assembly election is nearing. She also said there was no need of a written agreement from Tamil Nadu as both the Collectors jointly decided to initiate the process for closing down the shop,\u201d Ms. Maruthi said.\n\nAs total prohibition exists unofficially in Attappady, the shop at Anaikatti has been doing brisk business with sales crossing Rs. 5 crore a month.\n\nIt is one of the largest selling liquor retail outlets in Tamil Nadu.\n\nA month\u2019s time has been sought to close the shop, the Palakkad Collector said",
