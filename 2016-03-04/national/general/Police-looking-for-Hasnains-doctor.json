On February 28, Hasnain killed 14 of his family, including children, before committing suicide in Kasarvadavali village.\n\nSizopin found\n\nDuring the investigation, the Thane police found a strip of Sizopin, a third-line treatment drug for advanced schizophrenia, leading them to believe that Hasnain\u2019s actions were the result of a serious mental problem.\n\nA Thane police officer said inquiries among Hasnain\u2019s friends and family members failed to provide any clue on the doctor who recommended the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe doctor\u2019s input is crucial to establish the motive behind the mass murders and suicide. We are now approaching associations of mental health care specialists to enlist their help in identifying and tracing the doctor,\u201d he added.\n\nTill now, investigating officers have consulted experts in psychology to determine the significance of the presence of Sizopin in Hasnain\u2019s room. They have been told that even if Hasnain was buying Sizopin over the counter illegally, someone with knowledge about schizophrenia would have recommended it to him, which means someone outside his family knew about his symptoms.\n\nThe officer said: \u201cExperts have also told us that the discovery of the drug does not necessarily mean that Hasnain was suffering from schizophrenia for a long time. In some cases, doctors tend to prescribe Sizopin without trying other drugs first if the symptoms are strong enough.\u201d",
