But I kept the video mute. First, he could not indentify where Umar Khalid was standing in the crowd though video was from the same angle and distance from where Amarjeet has claimed to have clearly seen and heard Umar Khalid.\u201d\n\nBut Amarjeet, even after this point, stood his ground and claimed he heard Umar Khalid raising slogans. \u201cWhen I played the audio, none of the words Amarjeet attributed to Khalid were spoken at that moment. He retracted his statement.\u201d\n\nThe third official, V.P. Yadav, had earlier told the internal committee that he had himself heard Kanhaiya giving anti-national speech at Ganga Dhaba. \u201cBut when I cross examined him, he said that he didn\u2019t go near Ganga Dhaba. He also changed his statement,\u201d the report said.",
