    "text": "Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday that the government had examined the video recording of the February 28 condolence meeting in Agra for the murdered VHP leader Arun Mahaur, in which Minister of State for Human Resource Ram Shankar Katheria participated.\n\n\u201cWe gave the CD to our officers. They informed us that there were no objectionable utterances by the Minister. He had not said anything against or used derogatory language against any community,\u201d Mr. Singh said in the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\u201cNo objectionable contents against any particular community have been noticed. The news reports appear to be distorted and incorrect.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Katheria had not made inflammatory statements, the police did not file an FIR, he said. Mr. Singh said Mr. Katheria had insisted on strict action against those responsible for his murder.",
