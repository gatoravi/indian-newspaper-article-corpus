    "text": "A.N. Rajan Babu and K.K. Shaju, leaders of the Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samithi (JSS) faction aligned to the United Democratic Front, have parted ways. The move has led to a virtual split in the fragmented party.\n\nDiscontent has been brewing in the party for some time. The rift became wide open when Mr. Babu continued his association with Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan, while the latter launched an initiative to form a new party sometime back. Mr. Babu\u2019s explanation then was that he was the legal adviser to the Yogam and that he had no role in the formation of the new party. The district unit of the Congress has openly criticised Mr. Babu\u2019s overtures.\n\nMr. Shaju said he was willing to join the Congress if it deemed necessary. He had always been a staunch supporter of the UDF. If the party wanted him to contest in the Congress ticket from Adoor or Mavelikara, he would be ready, he said.\n\n\u201cI have disclosed my decision to the people through the media,\u201d he said. He would convene a meeting of his supporters to discuss the future course of action, he said.\n\nMr. Babu said: \u2018\u2018KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran is adamant on keeping his party away.\u201d He had met JSS founder K.R. Gouri a few days ago to discuss cases filed in respect of assets of the JSS. He had filed cases against Ms. Gouri to prevent disposal of assets of the party.\n\nHe claimed that the assets had been raised by party members prior to the formation of the splinter groups and as such, she did not enjoy absolute rights over the ownership of party assets.",
