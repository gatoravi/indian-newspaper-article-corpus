    "text": "Members of the Congress and the AIADMK sparred in the Lok Sabha during Zero Hour over the State\u2019s decision. Mr. Kharge demanded a response from Mr. Singh, who was present in the House. If such convicts were freed, other States might make similar demands, Mr. Kharge said. Such a move should not be allowed for the sake of the country\u2019s unity and integrity, he said.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters: \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with the Tamil Nadu government[\u2019s move]. The Supreme Court has already rejected the plea [for the release of the convicts] of several organisations. We will definitely oppose this move.\u201d\n\nThe Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP struck a cautious note. It said a \u201chumane approach\u201d should be adopted given the incarceration period of the seven convicts, but it should be within the legal framework.",
