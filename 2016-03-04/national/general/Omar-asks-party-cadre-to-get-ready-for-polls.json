However, at the same time, we are not opposed to any other idea being floated as a solution.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, prepare for the urban local bodies polls and even Assembly elections. This time we will win with a thumping majority,\u201d Mr. Abdullah told his supporters at a youth convention in Srinagar.\n\nMr. Abdullah\u2019s remarks assume significance after the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and ally BJP failed to stake claim to form the government. After Chief Minister Sayeed\u2019s death on January 7, J&K remains under Governor\u2019s rule.\n\n\u201cIf Mehbooba [Mufti] is not able to form the government then she should meet the Governor for dissolution of the Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Abdullah ruled out extending any outside support to the PDP in case it splits from the BJP.",
