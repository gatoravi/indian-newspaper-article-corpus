Narayanaswamy, who was recently elected as member to the Karnataka Legislative Council from the Bengaluru Local Authorities\u2019 constituency from the Congress.\n\nJustice A.S. Bopanna passed the order on a petition filed by defeated candidate Doddabasavaraju (BJP), who questioned the legality of Mr. Narayanaswamy\u2019s election.\n\nThe petitioner, who submitted a video in a compact disc to the High Court, claimed that the footage showed that some people were made to take oath that they would vote for the Congress candidate. It was also alleged in the petition that model/duplicate ballot papers were used to cast votes, thus impacting the sanctity of the election held in December 2015.",
