This tradition is hundreds of years old and was not questioned by women VIPs, including ex-President Pratibha Patil, ex-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Chief Minister of Rajasthan Vasudharaje Sindhia during their visits.\n\nMoreover, 1,200 local women have also submitted a petition to the local administration opposing any violation of the temple tradition, said a press release from Sunil Ghanvat, HJS organiser for Maharashtra\n\nThe HJS accused the Bhumata Brigade members of indulging in cheap publicity gimmicks and holding the district administration, police and residents to ransom, and advised them, instead to help tackle more important problems facing women such as rapes, sexual atrocities, and molestations.\n\n\u201cOn the day of Mahashivaratra, lakhs of devotees visit Trimbakeshwar. There is every likelihood of law and order problems due to the agitation by the Bhumata Brigade. In such a case, the entire responsibility will be pinned on the administration. Therefore, the activists must be banned from entering Nashik district,\u201d said the HJS press release.",
