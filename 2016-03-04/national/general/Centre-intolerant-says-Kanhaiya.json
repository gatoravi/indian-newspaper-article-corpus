If you speak against the government, their cyber cell will send your doctored videos and count the number of condoms in your hostel; 69 per cent people of this country voted against their ideology. Only 31 per cent are those who were fooled by their \u2018Jumlebaazi\u2019.\u201d\n\nFurther explaining the term \u201cazadi\u201d that is often used by JNU students during their speeches, Mr. Kumar said: \u201cI want to tell the entire nation, today, what is the azadi that we ask for. We want azadi from capitalism, from brahminism, from casteism, this is the kind of azadi that we want.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke to the students about his time in jail. \u201cWhen I spent time in jail, I realised that the constable who was taking me for medical tests, for food, they are also people like me. They are also a part of the corrupt system. When I tried to explain to them my views, they understood what is the kind of azadi that we have been demanding.\u201d Mr. Kumar came to the JNU campus after meeting some leaders at the CPI office. He will also address a press conference along with the senior party leaders on Friday.",
