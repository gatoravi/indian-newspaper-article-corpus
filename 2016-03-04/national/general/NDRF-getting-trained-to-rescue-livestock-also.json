However, livestock protection is in no way less important,\u201d Mr. Singh said, addressing a workshop on \u2018Management of Animals in Emergencies\u2019 organised by the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to know that they are now getting trained on management of animals in emergencies and working to get equipped to rescue animals also from disasters,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIndia is vulnerable to a large number of disasters. On an average, direct natural disaster losses amount up to 2 per cent of India\u2019s GDP. Around 94,830 cattle are lost per year on an average due to floods alone in India as per the National Disaster Management Authority\u2019s [NDMA] Flood Guidelines,\u201d he said, pointing out that the losses and impact of natural disasters on animals are equally significant, but are neither reported nor highlighted by media.\n\nIndia is having not only the largest bovine population but also the second largest cattle population and the third largest sheep population in the world.\n\nPointing out that disasters have the potential to affect our vast livestock resources adversely, Mr. Singh said there was a need to put in collective efforts to adopt a holistic approach in addressing the issues of animals for which sensitisation of all the related stakeholders is very essential.\n\nThe government has announced Rs. 1600 crore for Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries in the budget for the year 2016-17 as against allocation of Rs. 1491 crore in the year 2015-16.",
