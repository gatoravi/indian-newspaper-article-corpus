But it was suspended in 2013 to cut costs. Emirates said it remained enthusiastic about linking its airline network to the region and would keep its staff in Panama.\n\nGerman airline Lufthansa recently launched a direct flight to Panama, which the company said was its first to Central America. \u2014 AFP",
