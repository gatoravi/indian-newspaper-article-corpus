    "text": "Veteran All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) leader and senior-most leader of the Left Front in West Bengal, Ashok Ghosh, died here on Thursday. He was 94. He had been on ventilator support for over a month.\n\nA freedom fighter, Mr. Ghosh was the State secretary of the AIFB, the second biggest constituent of the Left Front, since 1951 \u2014 for 65 years. He joined the AIFB in 1940, a year after its formation, influenced by the political philosophy of Subhas Chandra Bose. In more than seven decades of public life, Mr. Ghosh did not leave the AIFB. Born on July 21, 1921 at Chinsurah in the Hooghly district of south Bengal, he was one of the founding members of the Left Front in West Bengal, which ruled the State for 34 years from 1977 to 2011.\n\nMr. Ghosh\u2019s most significant contribution to the Bengal\u2019s Left movement was destabilising the Congress by forging an anti-Congress alliance, much before the CPI(M)-led Left Front came to power in West Bengal. He was one of the key architects of the first and three successive anti-Congress governments between 1967 and 1970.\n\n\u201cHe indeed was one of the key leaders of the Front after Jyoti Basu,\u201d said Shyamal Chakravarty, senior CPI(M) leader. Mr. Ghosh played a significant role in providing advice and support to his comrades in Bangladesh during the Liberation War of 1971.\n\nAside from Jyoti Basu, Mr. Ghosh was perhaps the only other leader who was acceptable to all Front constituents and even to the Front\u2019s arch rival, Mamata Banerjee, who paid many visits to the veteran over the years. \u201cHe used to like me a lot on a personal level,\u201d the Trinamool Congress leader, who visited the ailing leader a few weeks ago in the hospital, tweeted.",
