    "text": "Nearly a month after the mysterious explosion in Vellore district scientists have declared that they did not find any meteorite substance in the samples collected from the scene. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and the State police had earlier said the explosion was caused by a \u201cmeteorite fall\u201d.\n\nOn February 6, a man was killed and three others injured following an explosion in the campus of a private engineering college at Natrampalli in Vellore district.\n\nWhile forensic experts ruled out a land explosion since no explosive material, ingredient or chemical residuals were found at the scene, scientists from the country\u2019s top laboratories say they have reasons to believe that the mysterious explosion, the first of its kind, is a matter of \u201cserious concern\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no definite proof to conclude that it was a meteorite fall. The samples given to us do not have the properties of a meteorite. May be, we are looking at the wrong samples. The footage from surveillance cameras, eyewitness accounts and nature of injuries certainly point to something serious. It is likely that something fell from the space\u2026whether it bounced off or got scattered has to be seen,\u201d a top scientist from the National Physical Laboratory, Ahmedabad, told The Hindu on Thursday. The focus now is on ascertaining the source of the object and preventing the recurrence of such falls.",
