Joshi, senior Congress leader and general secretary in-charge for Assam.\n\n\u201cWe are positive that we will win,\u201d he said, adding that the BJP\u2019s alleged attempts to mobilise voters by whipping up communal tensions had no takers in the State. Mr. Gandhi will land in Silchar district at 1 p.m. and head straight to upper reaches of Assam, where the BJP has reportedly poached Congress leaders who exert a strong influence in the business communities who own large swathes of tea plantations and employ local labourers.\n\nAbdul Hamid, Congress general secretary in Assam, told The Hindu that Mr. Gandhi would also go on a padayatra with a hope to establish relations with the tribal population, which was largely affiliated with the Asom Gana Parishad. The AGP had entered into an alliance with the BJP and agreed to contest 24 out of 126 seats. The AGP has been hit by intra-party rifts ever since it joined hands with the BJP. A Congress leader in Assam said his party was trying to \u201cpoach\u201d dissenting leaders of the AGP.",
