    "text": "Invoking Rajiv Gandhi over disruptions, Mr. Modi read out a statement made by the former in which he had expressed \u201cpain\u201d over the stalling of Parliament and said that while it hurt the government, it equally hurt the members of the Opposition who wanted to raise issues of their concern.\n\nHe listed legislation pending before the House, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill aimed at overhauling the taxation system, telling the Congress that since much of what had been done in the past was being claimed by the Congress, this too should be claimed and cleared.\n\n\u201cIt [the GST Bill] is yours only, still it is being stopped,\u201d he said. The Prime Minister elaborated on what he termed the Congress\u2019s habit of claiming ownership of every development work done by any government in India. Referring to the construction of toilets, in every school, or even settling the India-Bangladesh boundary agreement, Mr. Modi said the Congress \u201ccould claim credit, since if they had done the job, he would not have had to do it.\u201d\n\nResponding to the Congress\u2019s contention that the MGNREGA was the baby of the previous UPA government and that the NDA regime had repackaged and usurped it, Mr. Modi said such a programme had first been initiated in Maharashtra in 1972. \u201cThe programme exists because the previous government had sunk the roots of poverty so deep in the ground, even deeper than I previously thought,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Prime Minister ended his speech asking for cooperation from MPs and parties to run the House, this pugnacious turn, after a more than combative speech by Mr. Rahul Gandhi the previous day, has hardened battle lines.\n\nCites Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s statement which expresses \u201cpain\u201d over stalling of Parliament",
