OBOR is not an exclusive initiative, and we welcome participation of various countries and regional organisations,\u201d he said, making a special mention of the BCIM (Bangladesh China India and Myanmar) roadways and trade route project.\n\nSpeaking directly after, Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar, focussed instead on the government\u2019s project of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the BBIN (Bangladesh Bhutan India and Nepal) sub-regional connectivity initiative, warning against hidden agendas in promoting connectivity.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be impervious to the reality that others may see connectivity as an exercise in hard-wiring that influences choices. This should be discouraged, because particularly in the absence of an agreed security architecture in Asia, it could give rise to unnecessary competitiveness\u201d, he said.\n\nAn organiser from the Observer Research Foundation, that is co-hosting the Raisina Dialogue, rejected criticism that panels on Asian security had lacked Chinese participation for \u2018balance\u2019, saying many more senior participants had been invited from China for the conference, but had declined to attend. \u201cWe hope for more participation from several countries next year,\u201d said the organiser, adding that about 40 countries had been represented this year.",
