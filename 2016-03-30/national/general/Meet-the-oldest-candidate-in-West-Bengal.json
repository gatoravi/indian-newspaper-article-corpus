Now after 52 years and 10 stints as a Congress MLA, Gyan Singh Sohan Pal, at 91, is the eldest candidate in the fray in the State.\n\nMr. Pal, fondly called \u201cChacha\u201d, is contesting in the IIT town of Kharagpur, which has returned him consecutive times. \u201cEach and every one in Kharagpur knows me personally and I too know them personally,\u201d Mr. Pal, who was first elected from the constituency in 1969, says.\n\nKharagpur, which has a sizeable chunk of Muslim and Malayali voters, has traditionally rooted for him. He enjoys immense respect among politicians in all parties.\n\nThis time, the former Transport Minister in the Siddharth Shankar Ray Cabinet is contesting as a Left Front-Congress candidate against Trinamool Congress\u2019s Ramaprasad Tiwari and BJP\u2019s State president Dilip Ghosh.\n\nBoth the Trinamool and the BJP are hopeful of reversing the tide this time.\n\n\u201cI am a son of this district. Kharagpur has not seen much development under the Congress. We want to change it,\u201d Mr. Ghosh says.\n\nFor Phase 1(A) elections on April 4, 133 candidates are in the fray in 18 constituencies of three districts of West Bengal.\n\nWhile the Trinamool Congress and the BJP have fielded candidates for all 18 seats, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is fighting for 11 seats. \u2014 PTI",
