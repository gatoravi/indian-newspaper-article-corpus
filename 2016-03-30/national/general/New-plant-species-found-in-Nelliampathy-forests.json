    "text": "Two leading researchers in the field of botanical taxonomy in the State have reported the discovery of a rare plant species from the Pottumala region of the Nelliampathy forests in the Western Ghats. Researchers Soumya Murugan from Thiruvananthapuram and Maya C. Nair, head of the department of Botany, Government Victoria College, Palakkad, have spotted the new plant species with botanical name Sonerila nairii , which comes under the family of Melasto mataceae .\n\nThe discovery from biodiversity rich Nelliampathy has been published in the latest issue of Phytotaxa , an international journal on taxonomy. Interestingly, the researchers have named the plant as Sonerila nairii as a tribute to eminent botanist P.K.K. Nair, who founded Thiruvananthapuram - based Environmental Resources Research Centre.\n\nHe had contributed immensely to the field of Palynology, the study of plant pollen, spores and certain microscopic plankton organisms in both living and fossil form.\n\nThe plant with pink coloured flowers is a highly endangered species. It was seen growing around 1,200 metres above sea level. Each plant carries just two flowers. The plant grows in soil found in the gaps of rocks.\n\n\u201cThe plant species is enlisted in the critically endangered category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature . We spotted it while working on the flora of Kollengode range forests in Palakkad district,\u201d said Ms. Murugan.",
