It was only at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, nearly 26 hours after the pronouncement of the bail order, that the copy was signed by the 25th Metropolitan Magistrate and the lawyers rushed to Cherlapally prison facility to secure the release of the accused.\n\nThrough the day, the UoH campus remained tense, with students anticipating the release and preparing to welcome the arrested students.\n\nAccording to a senior faculty member, among those who had given sureties for the accused, all formalities were completed by 11.30 a.m. itself. \u201cWe arrived at the court premises at Miyapur by 10.30 a.m. After presenting all the paperwork, we were asked to sign some of the papers in another room till about 12.30 p.m.,\u201d she said.\n\nThe faculty member said that they were told that the bail order would be signed by the magistrate before lunch, which did not happen. \u201cInstead, even after lunch time, we were just made to wait. It was at 4.30 p.m. when they paraded us inside. And the magistrate then made a fuss about one of the ID cards as it was old. She made us read out all the details from it,\u201d said the faculty member.\n\nEven until 5 p.m., there was no headway, as the bail order was not out. And once it was out after 6 p.m., the lawyers had arranged for it to be taken to the Cherlapally jail immediately. On Monday, the matter had dragged all day, as the bail hearing had been passed over because the State public prosecutor did not turn up.\n\nThe copy was signed only at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, almost 26 hours after the oral pronouncement of the order",
