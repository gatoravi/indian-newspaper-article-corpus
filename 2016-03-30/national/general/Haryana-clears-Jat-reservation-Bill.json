    "text": "A government release said the Bill provides for an increase in the percentage of reservation in the Schedule I, II and III for Class I and II posts for BC \u2018A\u2019, BC \u2018B\u2019 and BC \u2018C\u2019 from 10 per cent, five per cent and five per cent to 11 per cent, six per cent and six per cent respectively.\n\nIt was also decided to increase the existing reservation for the economically backward persons in the general caste category in Class I and II posts from five per cent to seven per cent.\n\nThe Bill states that notwithstanding anything contained in it, the government may provide horizontal reservation for such category or categories of persons within the Backward Classes, as it may deem necessary from time to time.\n\nMr. Khattar later told reporters that the government had fulfilled its promise. \u201cThis Bill would enable the members belonging to six communities to get reservation in government services and admission to educational institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief Minister said the provisions of reservation would be implemented immediately after the Governor\u2019s assent to the Bill. \u201cA request would also be made to the Central government to include this Act in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution. We have not only maintained the reservation provisions of BC-A and B categories, but also extended some more benefits to them through this Bill.\u201d Mr. Khattar said a notification enhancing the reservation under Economically Backward Class would be issued shortly.",
