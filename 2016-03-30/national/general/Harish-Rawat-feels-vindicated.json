    "text": "Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said on Tuesday he felt vindicated by the High Court ordering a floor test. \u201cThe High Court\u2019s decision shows the Central government was wrong [in persuading the President to impose Central rule on the State]. The Governor had ordered that I prove majority in the Assembly on March 28. But President\u2019s Rule was imposed to prevent me from proving majority in the House.\u201d\n\nTaking a dig at the BJP, he said the High Court had, through its decision, challenged the BJP\u2019s practice of \u2018toppling\u2019 State governments. \u201cThe trend of dismantling governments shall stop after this judgment and the High Court has ensured that the other States will not have to undergo this trauma,\u201d he said. The High Court ruled that the nine rebel MLAs who were suspended on Sunday by the Speaker shall also vote in the Assembly.",
