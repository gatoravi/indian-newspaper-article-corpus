    "text": "Humanitarian aid organisation M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) has questioned the Indian government\u2019s decision to have patent officers trained by the United States Patent & Trademark Office after the recent controversy over compulsory licensing.\n\nThe government gave private, verbal assurance to U.S. industry lobby groups \u2014 the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 that it would not use \u2018compulsory licensing\u2019 for commercial purposes, indicating that the Indian patent office won\u2019t readily give out patents to domestic pharma companies for low cost generic versions of patented drugs.\n\nRights-based access campaigners say that the USIBC, which receives funding from multinational pharmaceutical companies, has been conducting training sessions for Indian patent examiners. It is likely to orient them to the narrative of Big Pharma, they fear.\n\nThe USIBC training module, a patent examiner in the Mumbai patent office said, was helping Indian examiners assess applications of life saving pharmaceutical products. \u201cWe have training by senior examiners from US PTO. Sometimes these training sessions are 3-6 days, sometimes they last six months. We have had officers sent from India to the U.S. for training. Our examiners usually learn as much as they can from the U.S. but try not to compromise our policy on Section 3(d). There is no doubt a clash of interest but these decisions are taken at a policy level.\u201d\n\nDespite repeated attempts, O.P. Gupta, Controller General of Patents, Trademarks and Design was unavailable for comment.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Leena Menghaney, South Asia head of the MSF\u2019s Access Campaign, said, \u201callows the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, which wants a more favourable patent regime to influence India\u2019s patent office decisions.\u201d\n\nThe MSF maintains that this is a part of the U.S. policy to single out India \u2014 the world\u2019s principal producer and supplier of quality generic medicines \u2014 for lax enforcement of intellectual property.\n\n\u201cThe Indian FDA has independent regulatory pathways to register low cost generic versions of new drugs, which has led to millions of people living with HIV receiving treatment supplied by Indian manufacturers. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry, backed by the USTR, wants Indian authorities to relax their patent examination system and is now even training patent examiners through business associations,\u201d Ms. Menghaney added.",
