It\u2019s the question in the region where Maoists no longer have a presence\n\nast week, when Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announced that she would always \u201ctake care of the residents of Jangalmahal\u201d, Niyoti Mahato, a homemaker in her early 40s, fumed.\n\n\u201cWe know her commitment; she has turned Jangalmahal into a military hub,\u201d said Ms. Mahato, standing in the veranda of her house, a few hundred yards from the field at Lalgarh where Ms. Banerjee was addressing a public meeting.\n\nMs. Mahato is the wife of Chhatradhar Mahato, the key leader of a Maoist-backed people\u2019s movement at Lalgarh, who had been a close aide of Ms. Banerjee till 2011.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, he contested from prison and got nearly 20,000 votes. What does that indicate,\u201d Ms. Mahato asks.\n\nThat is a complex question in the forest areas of the south-western districts of West Bengal, named as Jungle Mahal by the British. Do the Maoists still cross the Ayodhya Hills on the Bengal-Jharkhand border to enter the villages of Purulia and Paschim Medinipur? The answer is \u2018No\u2019, and the Chief Minister is correct to underscore that \u201cpeace has returned to Jangalmahal.\u201d\n\nThe writing on the wall\n\n\u201cGraffiti is crucial in the Santhal Paragana,\u201d says Jayanta Das, Editor of the local newspaper Seemarekha . \u201cIn tribal areas, people largely vote for the party whom they allow to paint the symbol on their wall.\u201d Going by Mr. Das\u2019s observation, the competition is tough for the Trinamool. At least 30-35 per cent of the walls are captured by the Left alliance, unlike in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism of exploitation \u2014 put in place by the local CPI(M) leaders in the past \u2014 was only accelerated by the police. Similar police action is making a comeback,\u201d says Ms. Mahato. Many allege that they are often picked up in the erstwhile Maoist stronghold for asking simple service-related questions.\n\n\u201cMy son was arrested as he had a minor altercation with the officer in charge of the local police station. He was charged for waging war against the state as a youth leader of Maoists,\u201d says Bhajahari Kumar, a senior leader of the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) of the Baghmundi block in Purulia. Nearly everyone acknowledges that the Maoists have left the area, while the joint forces stayed. \u201cWasn\u2019t it TMC\u2019s commitment to remove paramilitary forces after coming to power,\u201d Mr. Kumar asks.\n\nThere is a long list of such unfulfilled promises in the erstwhile Maoist stronghold of Purulia, Paschim Medinipur and Bankura districts, where polling will be held in 40 constituencies on April 4 and 11. Ms. Banerjee has not released the political prisoners as promised. An acute shortage of water in the summer, lack of work to sustain households throughout the year \u2014 the list of grievances is long. Moreover, nepotism to consolidate the party at the grassroots level is increasing.\n\n\u201cLook at that canal made of cement,\u201d says Srikanto Lohar, who owns the first house in Kashmar village in Medinipur. \u201cIt remains dry throughout the year as the water flows in the opposite direction.\u201d Such pointless construction \u2014 whether they are canals, check dams or huge administrative buildings \u2014 are plenty and so are the complaints. \u201cThese have only benefited the contractors of the TMC,\u201d alleged Mr. Lohar\u2019s family members.\n\nEven then, the Trinamool may not find it difficult to win a majority of seats in the region. A senior IAS officer told The Hindu that the dearness allowance paid to government employees in West Bengal was at least 40 per cent less than the amounts in other big States. \u201cMy batch mates in Bengal get Rs. 30,000 to 40,000 less than what I do,\u201d said the officer, who hails from a small State. The money so saved by the government is spent on rural infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to spend the money that should have gone to middle-class government employees on rural infrastructure \u2026 the number of government employees is much smaller than that of the rural poor,\u201d the officer said.\n\nEven Ms. Banerjee\u2019s biggest critics would accept that the Trinamool had hugely invested in rural roads. \u201cIf I compare the rural roads of Bengal with those of other States, it is way above average,\u201d said a senior poll observer.\n\n\u201cThough being the biggest critic of the Trinamool, I would have to acknowledge that electricity has reached many parts of the district, and we have no power cut,\u201d says Mr. Das, the Editor. And even Chhatradhar Mahato\u2019s wife accepted that foodgrains are sold at Rs. 2 per kg in rural areas.\n\n\u201cBut at what cost,\u201d she asks.\n\nThe cost indeed is huge. Many are dead or on the list of disappeared, while the rest joined the ruling party to survive. However, the region\u2019s infrastructure has improved.\n\nMs. Mahato feels her husband initiated this \u201cmarginal improvement\u201d by launching the people\u2019s movement, thus ensuring the Trinamool\u2019s victory in 2011. \u201cBut he is in jail as we go to another polls \u2026\u201d she stops as Ms. Banerjee starts listing achievements at a rally, almost in the backyard of her house.\n\nEven Mamata Banerjee\u2019s biggest critics will accept\n\nthat rural roads\n\nhave improved",
