    "text": "Pakistani Lieutenant-General Asim Bajwa addresses journalists in Islamabad on Tuesday, giving details of Kulbhushan Yadav (on screen), who is suspected of being an Indian spy.\u2014 PHOTO: AFP\n\nHe said he used to report to an R&AW officer named Anil Kumar Gupta.\n\nRAW officials weren\u2019t available for comment. However, the MEA said that the video has \u201cno basis in fact.\u201d \u201cThat the individual claims to make the statements of his own free will not only challenges credulity but clearly indicates tutoring,\u201d the MEA said, asking Pakistan to provide consular access to Mr. Yadav. It is necessary to find out how he landed in Pakistan \u201cunder unexplained circumstances,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nThe former Foreign Secretary, Kanwal Sibal, told The Hindu that the entire sequence of events leading up to the arrest indicated Pakistani officials wanted to push back on allegations of terror.\n\n\u201cPakistan wants to get some propaganda advantage as the U.S. has stepped up pressure after the Pathankot attack. Pakistan has accused the person of being a serving naval officer. This is incredible as no intelligence agency sends serving naval officers with passports.\u201d",
