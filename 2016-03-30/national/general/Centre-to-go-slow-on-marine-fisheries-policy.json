Murti, president, Federation of Indian Fishery Industries, told The Hindu on Monday.\n\nThe proposals to allow foreign trawlers and the silence on carving out a separate Ministry for fisheries, granting ST status and agriculture status to the fishery industry, social security for small and medium fishermen, introduction of pension and ban on bottom trawling have angered fishermen across the country.\n\nIts possible fallout on elections in five States seems to have forced a rethink",
