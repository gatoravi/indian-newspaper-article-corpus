    "text": "The second batch of Netaji files, released on Tuesday, reveal that Suresh Chandra Bose, brother of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, had, without permission, published secret government documents in his book \u201c Dissentient Report \u201d, violating the Official Secrets Act. The government discussed if some action should be taken, but then decided to let the matter rest.\n\nSuresh Bose was part of the three-man Netaji Enquiry Commission, headed by Shah Nawaz Khan, which was constituted in 1956, to investigate the death of Netaji. While two members of the Commission concluded that Netaji had died in an air crash, Bose rejected the theory. In his book, he accused then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, of not being interested in any enquiry as he was \u201cconvinced\u201d about Netaji\u2019s death.\n\nIn the book, Bose wrote: \u201cI consider myself exceedingly fortunate to have succeeded in securing some top secret reports\u2026.and in my being able to secure a few photographs, sketches and other papers, which along with other papers were indispensably necessary for writing my report and which our Government have intentionally withheld from me.\u201d",
