Hoardings in Guwahati, however, presage the imminent political storm. And while the dour promises and exhortations are but a political necessity, humour \u2014 albeit of the black kind \u2014 has made a surprise appearance on Guwahati billboards.\n\n\u201cBaad diya hai BJP\u2019r leksar, eibar hobo Congressorei sorkar\u2026 Misa koley ki hobo! (Never mind the BJP\u2019s lecture, it\u2019ll be a Congress government this time\u2026 the BJP\u2019s lies won\u2019t help!),\u201d proclaims a hoarding [see picture] joining the Maligaon flyover. Posters showing Sarbananda Sonowal, the BJP\u2019s chief ministerial candidate, touching the feet of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley \u2014 with an accompanying poser about how someone who surrenders Assam\u2019s pride at Delhi\u2019s Rajpath can protect regional interests \u2014 were reportedly taken down after the BJP threatened to complain to the Election Commission.\n\nHowever, a wall-to-wall visage of Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi still stares at passers-by on G.S. Road, proclaiming, \u201cWill take what is Assam\u2019s due by fighting courageously, not by bending the knee.\u201d\n\nThe no-holds-barred election that this is, the BJP isn\u2019t taking it lying down. Close to the Congress headquarters, it has put up a caricature of a sleeping Tarun Gogoi with the caption: \u201cThe Bogibeel bridge [on the Brahmaputra river in Upper Assam, which will be India\u2019s longest rail-cum-road bridge when commissioned] hasn\u2019t been completed in 15 years. Even the Taj Mahal didn\u2019t take so long! Mr. Gogoi, the time for you to answer is over.\u201d There are variations on the sleeping CM theme across different parts of the city.\n\nThe rhyming, catchy \u2014 and stupendously successful \u2014 general election slogan of \u201cAbki baar, Modi sarkar\u201d has found currency even in the Congress camp, of course with the requisite tweak: \u201cAxomot uthise Congressor juwar, Tarun Gogoi akou ebar (The Congress tide surges in Assam, it\u2019s Tarun Gogoi once more).\u201d\n\nNot to be left behind, the All India United Democratic Front, the principal Opposition party in the outgoing Assembly, has rustled up its own poetry: \u201cBJP\u2019r bhal dinor porinam, axohishnuta, niboniyo xomosya, boy-bostur sora dam? (BJP\u2019s achche din \u2014 intolerance, unemployment, price rise?\u201d)\n\nabdus.salam@\n\nthehindu.co.in\n\nNo party is\n\ntaking things\n\nlying down in the\n\nno-holds-barred\n\nelections",
