    "text": ": The Delhi High Court on Monday sought a list showing which of the pharmaceutical companies that have approached the court against the Centre's decision to ban some fixed drug combination (FDC) medicines have obtained licences from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and which ones from the State bodies.\n\nHearing a batch of writ petitions challenging the Union government\u2019 s March 10 notification banning over 300 FDC medicines, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw asked whether the Centre could take action against the companies manufacturing drugs with licences from the State authorities. There was a lacuna in the system if the State bodies were not under the control of DCGI, observed the court.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, defending the government\u2019s decision during the hearing, said the primary focus was on the lack of safety and efficacy of FDC drugs, because of which the ban had been imposed, while the lack of approval was a secondary issue.\n\n\u2018No reason given\u2019\n\nSenior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Pfizer, said the Kokate Committee on whose recommendation the ban had been notified, was not a statutory body. Besides, no reason was given for banning the FDC medicines other than saying that these combinations were not rational and lacked therapeutic justification.\n\nThe High Court has stayed the operation of the Centre's ban on FDC drugs of a large number of pharma companies after initially giving interim relief on March 14 to Pfizer's cough syrup, \u201cCorex\u201d.\n\nCompanies such as Cipla, Procter and Gamble, Lupin, Piramal, Manking Pharma, Glaxo Smithkline, and Glenmark have obtained relief from the court.",
