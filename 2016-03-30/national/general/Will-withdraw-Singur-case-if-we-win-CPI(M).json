    "text": "The party says industrialisation will be its poll plank in West Bengal\n\nOnce again making it clear that industrialisation will be its key plank in the West Bengal elections, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra on Tuesday said that if voted to power, the Left Front would withdraw the case in the Supreme Court regarding the land acquired for the Tata Motors factory at Singur in Hooghly.\n\nIn June 2012, the Calcutta High Court struck down the State government\u2019s Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011 terming it \u201cunconstitutional and void,\u201d following which the government challenged the verdict in the apex court. The law had been enacted by the Trinamool government to return a portion of the land acquired for the Nano factory to \u201cunwilling farmers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Left, democratic and secular government comes to power, our first priority will be to withdraw the case. There is no use continuing with it as the Act in defence of which it was filed is unconstitutional,\u201d said Mr. Mishra.\n\nHe said they would \u201ctry to\u201d set up industry at Singur without harming the interests of farmers. \u201cWe will work together with farmers for this. It is not just Singur and Salboni but there are many places where land is available for industry,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged false cases against Left Front workers, the CPI(M) leader said they would be withdrawn.",
