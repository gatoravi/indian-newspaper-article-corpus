What does the BJP want in Assam? First they will come and ask for your votes and then Assam will not be run from here, but from Nagpur or the Prime Minister\u2019s Office,\u201d he said at a poll rally here in Karbi district.\n\nMr. Gandhi said that wherever the BJP won, it disturbed the peace and cited the example of Haryana where within months of its coming to power, there was violence between Jats and non-Jats.\n\n\u201cYou have seen what happened in Gujarat. In Bihar, they tried to bring violence before polls, and in Assam too they are trying to spread violence. They don\u2019t think about you or Assam, they just want to impose one ideology and thought on the entire country, what the RSS people say,\u201d he said.\n\nHe accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making false promises, and said the people of Bihar sent him packing in a \u201cdirect flight\u201d from the State as he failed to fulfil any of the promises made to them during the Lok Sabha polls. \u2014 PTI\n\n\u201cBJP stokes violence wherever it goes\u2026 look at Gujarat, Haryana\u201d",
