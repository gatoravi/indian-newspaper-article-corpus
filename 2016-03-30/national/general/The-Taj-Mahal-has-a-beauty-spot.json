    "text": "Software scan finds the central dome is not perfectly symmetrical\n\nThe immaculate Taj Mahal isn\u2019t perfect after all, researchers have reported in the latest edition of the peer-reviewed science journal Current Science .\n\nThe key blemish lies in the iconic central dome long been considered the epitome of bilateral symmetry. By scanning several photographs, Dilip Ahuja and MB Rajani at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore, found the edges were off in some places by 0.5% to as much as 5.5%.\n\nDr. Ahuja told The Hindu that Ms. Rajani, a satellite imagery specialist, divided a photo of the dome into several horizontal lines and, using software, counted the number of pixels that make up these lines. Perfect bilateral symmetry would mean an equal number of pixels from the central axis to the left and right edges of the bulbous dome and the researchers found that except for the base and the pinnacle, this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nThe researchers \u2014 who have visited the monument multiple times \u2014 say the flaw can even be crudely discerned if one cut out a picture of the dome along its edge and folded it across the centre.\n\nDr. Ahuja, who specialises in energy and environment policy but also has an interest in Mughal architecture, said he was surprised that no one had written about the anomaly before.\n\n\u201cThe Taj\u2019s architecture has been criticised and Rajani\u2019s teacher \u2014 John Marr \u2014 a British art historian too referred to the asymmetry. But we couldn\u2019t find any analysis in the literature,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers, however, emphasise that the flaw doesn\u2019t mar the beauty of the edifice but maybe a reason to investigate if the discrepancy poses a structural risk to the monument.",
