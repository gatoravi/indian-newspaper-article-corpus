    "text": "Another fire broke out at the Deonar dumping ground on Monday night even as fire and rescue personnel were dousing the blaze that continued over the week, covering the area in smoke.\n\nFire officials, however, said the blaze that broke out on Monday night was minor, resulting from last week\u2019s fire possibly fuelled by methane from garbage dump, rising temperature and winds.\n\nAround 60 fire personnel were fighting the blaze that first started in January. The Mumbai fire department has also installed a chowkie in place inside the dumping yard with a wireless set to enable better communication and ensure quicker response.\n\nHowever, local residents have expressed their frustration over the continuing fire.",
