It was designed by engineers at a DRDO laboratory based in Pune and manufactured by Kineco Ltd., a Goan company.\n\nThe dome will be delivered later at Mazgaon Docks, Mumbai, to be attached to a warship.\n\nOnly a couple of companies in the world have the capability to make such a structurally demanding structure in composites, said Shekhar Sardesai, Executive Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Kineco Limited.\n\nThe sonar functions as the ship\u2019s underwater eyes and ears.\n\nThe dome is a structure fitted over the sonar array so that its electronics and sensors are not exposed to surrounding hostile environment. The sonar dome has to be structurally sound as well as acoustically transparent.\n\nKineco has a joint venture with Kaman Aerospace group of the U.S., which has also become a significant player in the field of aerospace composites.\n\nIt was designed by DRDO engineers and manufactured by a Goan company",
