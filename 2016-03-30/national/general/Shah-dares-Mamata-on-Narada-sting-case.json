    "text": "BJP president Amit Shah dared Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to ask for a CBI probe into the Narada sting video if she believes that the Trinamool Congress MPs, allegedly shown taking bribe, are innocent.\n\nAddressing the media here on Tuesday, he asserted that if Ms. Banerjee requests the Centre for a CBI probe, then within \u201c36 hours the truth\u201d would come out.\n\nMr. Shah denied the allegation of the Left and the Congress that the Centre was \u201cgoing soft\u201d on the Trinamool. \u201cIf Mamata Banerjee has the guts then she should seek a CBI probe. Journalists often ask me what the BJP is doing about it. The BJP has nothing to do here. Ms. Banerjee should expel the party leaders concerned on moral grounds,\u201d said Mr. Shah.\n\nHe said he was convinced that the Chief Minister would not take any action against the party leaders as \u201cpower is more important to her than curbing corruption.\u201d\n\nCM fumes at remark\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Banerjee sharply reacted to Mr. Shah\u2019s comment that the sound of Rabindra Sangeet was getting suppressed by bomb blasts in the State. \u201cIf anyone insults Bengal I will be their worst enemy\u2026 I have heard that he [Mr. Shah] has said something about Rabindranath Tagore,\u201d she said at a rally in Howrah.",
