I believe the time has come for the two countries to set up Truth and Reconciliation Commission to look into the cases of the past 26 years,\u201d said the former Chief Minister during a party function in Srinagar.\n\nNC president Farooq Abdullah asked New Delhi and Islamabad \u201cto actively work towards opening additional trade and travel routes along the Line of Control\u201d.\n\n\u201cTime has come to open the Jammu-Sialkot route for travel and trade. The Kargil-Skardu route should be thrown open and efforts should be made to open every possible route along the Line of Control to connect people on the two sides.\n\n\u201cSimilarly New Delhi and Islamabad should encourage people to travel to each other\u2019s countries and experience the commonalities in culture and philosophy and the universal bonds of brotherhood,\u201d he added.\n\nDr. Abdullah said there was no alternative to Indo-Pak friendship and cooperation.\n\nDescribing terrorism as \u201ca universal enemy\u201d, Dr. Abdullah said, \u201cThere could be no possible distinction between acts and ideologies of terror and violence. What happened in Lahore is heart-rending and painful. Time has come when we realise we need to be united in fighting violence and terror and safeguard the future of our coming generations.\u201d",
