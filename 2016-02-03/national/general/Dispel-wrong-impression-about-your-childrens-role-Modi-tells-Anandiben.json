The Prime Minister and others have conveyed to her to rectify and improve the image,\u201d said a top source close to her and the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cNot only in Gujarat, even in Delhi her children\u2019s involvement in the governance process has become a point of discussion,\u201d he said, stressing that \u201cthis perception has been created by her rivals from within the party as well as opponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither of the two, Anar or Shwetank, has ever tried to interfere in our work,\u201d the official added.\n\nIt is learnt that Mr. Modi had a word with Anandiben on the issue when she visited Delhi on January 25, the day Amit Shah was elected BJP president.\n\nSome BJP workers and bureaucracy have even started drawing comparisons between her government and that of Keshubhai Patel, who also faced allegations of interference and corruption by his family members, which eventually led to his removal in October 2011.\n\nEver since the 73-year-old Anandiben Patel took over as Chief Minister of Gujarat succeeding Mr. Modi following the May 2014 Lok Sabha polls, an impression has gained ground that her two children wield influence in the government.\n\nShwetank Patel, (who changed his name from Sanjay) is a businessman and owns a Bombay stock exchange-listed company Anar Industries Ltd, which, as per its website, \u201cis an integrated construction, infrastructure development and management company in India.\u201d\n\nHis 44-year-old sister Anar is a social entrepreneur and business woman.\n\nA prominent factor that has apparently given rise to the perception is their proximity to top builders and real estate players in Ahmedabad where land and realty prices have skyrocketed in the last decade.",
