However, six months after the students\u2019 admission to the college, the State government allegedly stopped the payment of the stipend, despite repeated requests by the college authorities.\n\nUnder the Dalit Students Stipend Scheme, the State government pays Rs.1.1 lakh for each student annually. One of the 60 students, Gajendra Kumar, said: \u201cThe college authorities forced us to leave the institution and the hostel on January 8 this year, saying the Bihar government had failed to pay our stipend despite their repeated requests\u201d.\n\nAnother student, Mukesh Kumar, told The Hindu over the phone, \u201cthe principal asked us to come only after our dues are cleared.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, if the Bihar government fails to pay our stipend, there will be no option left for us except to commit suicide\u201d, said a group of students, all in the second year of their course. The parents of some of the students had met officials of the department concerned, but \u201cdespite assurances, nothing has been done yet\u201d, said the father of a girl student, Pooja Kumari.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav said the issue would be resolved soon, and appealed to the students \u201cnot to take extreme steps\u201d. State Minister for Welfare of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes, Santosh Kumar Nirala, said there might be some mix-up in the bank account numbers given by the students. \u201cThe stipend for the students was released on January 22. The government is sensitive to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students and nobody will be denied stipend\u201d, said the Minister.\n\nThe Odisha govt.\n\nhas allegedly stopped paying their stipends to the college",
