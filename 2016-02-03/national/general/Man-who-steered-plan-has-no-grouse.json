The flagship programme of the UPA government had been handed over to Mr. Singh, a member of the Lalu Prasad-led Rashtriya Janata Dal, in the division of portfolios within the alliance.\n\nBetween the reformist leanings of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Deputy Chairperson of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and the rights-based approach advocated by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her National Advisory Council (NAC), it was Mr. Singh\u2019s obduracy that carried the day.\n\n\u201cIt is 10 years since the programme was launched, first implemented in 200 districts, then 120 and then the whole country. Over Rs. 3,14,000 crore have been spent on this programme. As a poverty alleviation programme, it has no parallel the world over,\u201d he told The Hindu from Patna.\n\nMr. Singh says that he feels no bitterness towards the Congress or the government for shutting him out of the celebrations to mark 10 years of the scheme. \u201cThey are all using either party platforms or official ones for it, why should they call me? I got the opportunity to do a particular job and I did it. Haani laabh, yash apyash, vidhi haath (profit and loss, fame and notoriety is all in the hands of fate),\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Funds not enough\u2019\n\nHe did, however, feel upset over the \u201cdilution\u201d of the job guarantee act. \u201cThe NDA government is not allocating enough funds for it. There has to be more transparency on payouts.\u201d\n\nNowadays, Mr. Singh is busy with the Madhesi movement in the Terai region bordering Nepal. \u201cThis blockade is ruinous and the Indian government, that played such a positive role in the past in Nepal, has sold out on the interests of the Madhesis,\u201d he said.",
