    "text": "Mounting the pressure on the Kolkata Police in connection with the Air Force personnel hit-and-run case, the Defence Ministry on Tuesday reiterated its demand for joint investigation and sharing evidence.\n\nWing Commander S.S. Birdi, spokesperson, Defence, Kolkata Region, told The Hindu that the Kolkata Police had only a few days ago responded to the Air Force\u2019s communication on a joint probe and sharing evidence.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Commissioner, Crime, has responded to the Air Force request for a joint investigation by stating in writing that \u2018one officer may be deputed to keep close coordination with us\u2019. The letter is silent on the joint probe,\u201d Mr. Birdi said.\n\nThe other issue raised by the Air Force in the death of its personnel Abhimanyu Gaud, who was allegedly run over by a speeding Audi car while supervising the Republic Day parade on Red Road last month, is providing the Air Force access to the evidence in the case.\n\nSpecial Additional Commissioner of Kolkata Police (Crime) Debasish Boral said a fresh case had been registered against Mohd. Sohrab, former MLA, whose son Sambia Sohrab is the prime accused in the case. The former MLA has been absconding since the hit-and-run incident came to light on January 13. Three persons have been arrested in the case so far.",
