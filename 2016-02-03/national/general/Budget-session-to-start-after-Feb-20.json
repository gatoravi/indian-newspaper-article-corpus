Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday made it clear that it would commence only after February 20.\n\nA clear picture on the dates for the session would emerge when the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs meets in New Delhi on Thursday.\n\nAt a press conference here, Mr. Naidu said he had invited some of the political leaders from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, which are going to the polls in April, for an informal meeting on the occasion to know their views on the session schedule. He clarified that it was not an all-party meeting.\n\nThe intention was to know about the convenient time for holding the budget session without affecting their poll campaign, the Minister said.",
