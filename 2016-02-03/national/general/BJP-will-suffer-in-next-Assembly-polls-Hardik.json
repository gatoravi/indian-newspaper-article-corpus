However, the government\u2019s efforts and offers to buy peace with Hardik don\u2019t seem to have cut ice with him.\n\nIn his latest letter addressed to some prominent Patel leaders, Hardik has stated: \u201cThe BJP will suffer in the next Assembly polls the way it suffered in the recently held local panchayat polls.\u201d",
