    "text": "An eviction team authorised by the Union Ministry of Urban Development on Tuesday cut water and power supply to a government-owned bungalow that was occupied by West Bengal Congress chief and MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.\n\nWhile Mr. Chowdhury described the eviction as \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d, the Directorate of Estates said the MP was not entitled to the property since he was no longer a Union Minister.\n\nMr. Chowdhury was allotted another house on Humayun Road, but he did not move there, the directorate said.\n\nThe eviction team arrived at Mr. Chowdhury\u2019s New Moti Bagh residence early in the morning. Apart from disconnecting the electricity and water supply lines, his furniture was moved out.\n\nThe Lok Sabha member from West Bengal\u2019s Murshidabad district moved the Delhi High Court, but it refused to step in to reverse the disconnection of utilities. The court, however, ordered status quo until the matter is heard on Wednesday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, West Bengal Congress leaders protested outside the BJP headquarters in north Kolkata against the eviction, alleging political vendetta by the BJP.",
