The subject and director of documentary film Sonita are seen accepting an award at this year's festival.\u2014 File Photo\n\nMany of the movies that played at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which ended on Sunday, have already been forgotten. It is harsh but true. Buzz comes and goes fast in the social media age.\n\nBut David Larkin says he believes he has a digital solution. Mr. Larkin is chief executive of Plexus Entertainment, a startup behind the website and app GoWatchIt. The service has multiple functions, but a primary one allows users to add the titles of unreleased movies to a digital queue. When the film does become available, GoWatchIt sends an alert. Mr. Larkin\u2019s research indicates that Sundance entries are released, on average, 206 days after their festival premieres.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that more people read about and are interested in Sundance films than actually go to Sundance, but the challenge is converting that buzz into paying customers,\u201d Mr. Larkin said. \u201cGenerating awareness is great, but it does very little good unless the consumers you have made aware are then escorted to a purchase.\u201d\n\nGoWatchIt expanded its partnership with Sundance this year \u2014 there was a GoWatchIt button on each page of the festival\u2019s digital program guide \u2014 and Larkin said that \u201clow tens of thousands\u201d of people added films to queues. For the art films that play Sundance, that could be a significant number, \u201chelping kick-start word of mouth for a limited theatrical run or helping get on the iTunes top-seller list,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Larkin said tests showed that GoWatchIt users opened emails notifying them of film availability in theaters, or on sites like Amazon, Netflix and iTunes, at a rate of up to 62 per cent and then click through to a movie service where a film can be bought or rented in up to 18 percent of cases. Those rates are sharply higher than the industry norm for entertainment-related emails, according to Constant Contact, an online marketing company.\n\nGoWatchIt makes money by charging fees to studios access to the site\u2019s data for specific films.
