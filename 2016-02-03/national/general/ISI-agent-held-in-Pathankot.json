A third accused, Akram, also part of the spy ring, was arrested on Tuesday from Jammu.\n\nThe arrest is considered to be important as Pathankot is still said to be on the radar of terrorist outfits.\n\nThe Indian Air Force base in Pathankot was stormed by militants reportedly belonging to Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad on the intervening night of January 1-2 that resulted in the death of seven security personnel.\n\nIrshad took up the job of a casual labourer inside the Army Cantt on January 22 with the help of a labour contactor. He was assigned to lay cables and wires inside the Army campus. Sajjad was allegedly passing on pictures sent to him to an ISI official in Pakistan through e-mails and web-based application services.\n\n\u201cIrshad had already received Rs. 10,000 for the first cache of pictures he sent to his handler. He was to get the remaining amount on reaching Jammu,\u201d said an official.",
