    "text": "Ten years ago the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) ushered in a paradigm shift in the development of the nation and there have been several significant achievements over the past decade, yet, certain issues in implementation remain.\n\nSocial activists Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey, associated with the People\u2019s Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) on Tuesday said: \u201cTen years of the MGNREGA should have been a time for celebration. However, the anniversary is marked by a continuing struggle for the release of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were expecting the Finance Minister to announce the release of at least Rs. 3,000 crore \u2014 the balance of the amount promised in his budget speech. However, this announcement was not made, and today the MGNREGA faces a negative balance of funds in 14 States,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Finance Minister had, in his budget speech in February 2015, promised an additional Rs. 5,000 crore, and though the funds with the Ministry of Rural Development have depleted, only Rs. 2,000 crore of the Rs. 5,000 crore have been released.\n\nThe inability to provide the money required as per work demand is a blatant violation of law, the activists said.\n\nIn spite of achievements, certain issues in implementation remain",
