Ten additional laboratories would be provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\u201d\n\nThe Health Ministry has set up a joint monitoring group under the Director-General of Health Services (DGHS) to follow the events daily. The NCDC and the Focal Point for International Health Regulations (IHR) have been tasked with sharing of information with the IHR focal points of the affected countries and to be in constant touch with the WHO for updates. Public health experts say poor vector control in India could lead to a possible outbreak. \u201cSince India has the mosquito [ Aedes aegypti ] responsible for the spread of the virus, the same one that causes dengue and chikungunya, if an infected individual comes here, infection can be spread by mosquitoes biting this person, acquiring the virus and then passing it on to those who are bitten subsequently,\u201d said Vivekanand Jha, executive director, George Institute for Global Health.\n\nRapid response teams will be activated at the Central and State surveillance units. In addition to strengthening laboratories, the government will activate the teams at Central and State surveillance units, the Health Ministry said. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme would track clustering of acute febrile illness and seek primary cause, if any, among those who travelled to areas with the ongoing transmission in the two weeks preceding the onset of illness.\n\nPublic health experts say poor vector control in India could lead to a possible outbreak",
