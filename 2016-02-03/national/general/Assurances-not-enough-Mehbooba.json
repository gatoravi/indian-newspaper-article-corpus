    "text": "Earlier, the senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister, Nirmal Singh, met Ms. Mufti in Jammu. Describing the meeting as \u201ca courtesy call,\u201d Mr. Singh said: \u201cEverything is all right between the PDP and the BJP. And we are in favour of continuing our coalition with the PDP.\u201d\n\nIn the past few weeks, BJP leaders in Delhi said the PDP had put forward many issues as part of the \u201cconfidence-building measures,\u201d including the handover of the Dulhasti and Uri Hydroelectric power plants from the National Hydro-electric Power Corporation (NHPC) to the State government, removal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and dropping a plan by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to open an office in Jammu.\n\nTough stance\n\nReflecting a hardening stand on the part of the BJP, the party general secretary, Ram Madhav, told The Hindu in Jaipur: \u201cThe next government, if it is with the PDP, will be formed only on the basis of the common minimum programme of the agenda for alliance that was agreed to with Mufti Sahab. No new demands or elements can be added to that. As far as confidence-building measures are concerned, the BJP works for confidence with the whole country and not just for Jammu and Kashmir.\u201d\n\nWith no end to the impasse, it is being hoped that the meeting between Ms. Mufti and Dr. Nirmal Singh, the first formal contact between the two parties after Mr. Mufti\u2019s death, would signal a new beginning for the alliance.",
