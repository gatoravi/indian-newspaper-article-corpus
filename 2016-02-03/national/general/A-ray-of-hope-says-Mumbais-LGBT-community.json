We are also tax paying citizens of this country.\u201d\n\nWhile members of the LGBT community face a slew of problems from not finding houses on rent and discrimination at workplace and general society, Bajaj hoped that a favourable judgment in the end would take the \u2018criminal\u2019 tag off homosexuality.\n\n\u201cAt least we won\u2019t be blackmailed and shamed,\u201d Bajaj said. \u201cThis is a stepping stone to an open dialogue. At workplaces we are still checked for criminal records. In rural areas, the situation in worse.\u201d\n\nGender rights activist Harish Iyer, whose matrimonial ad for an Iyer groom created a flutter last year, also welcomed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt is a positive step. It gives me hope that we haven\u2019t closed our ears and that we are parallel to science,\u201d said Iyer.\n\nHailing Tuesday\u2019s decision as \u201ca progressive step\u201d Ashok Row Kavi, founder chairman of Humsafar Trust and editor of \u2018Bombay Dost\u2019 said, \u201cThe very fact that the curative petition has been admitted is a big step forward. With more number of judges, we will have more opinions and the chances of success will be greater. This is the beginning of the fight for LGBT rights. In Mumbai, we have waged a 20-year-long struggle.\u201d",
