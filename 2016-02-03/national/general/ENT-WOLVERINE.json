    "text": "An unenviable task\n\nDirector Bryan Singer and producer Simon Kinberg say it recasting Wolverine in the future seemed to be kind of impossible. Actor Hugh Jackman, who has been playing the clawed mutant since 1999, expressed that he won\u2019t be back to reprise his role as Wolverine after The Wolverine 3 , X-Men Apocalypse . The duo said that they couldn\u2019t imagine that the iconic character would be played by someone other than Jackman, 47, reported Digital Spy. \u201cI do think you would want to figure out how to tell more Wolverine stories. So either we would try to entice Hugh to come back and eat more chicken and work out for a few months, or we would have to figure out a creative way to move forward.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
