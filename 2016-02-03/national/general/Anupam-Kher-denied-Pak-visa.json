    "text": "Was invited to Karachi Literature Festival beginning later this week\n\nActor Anupam Kher found himself in the middle of yet another controversy on Tuesday when he announced that Pakistan had denied him a visa to attend the Karachi Literature Festival beginning Friday.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan High Commission said the actor had never applied for one.\n\nMr. Kher was one of the 18 Indians invited to the four-day literary event. The 17 others, including senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid and actor Nandita Das, have been granted visa.\n\n\u201cOut of 18, why was I singled out? It could be either because I am a Kashmiri Pandit. I am not playing a card of Kashmiri Pandit and trying to divide people, or because I\u2019ve spoken about the issue of intolerance,\u201d he told presspersons at his acting school here on Tuesday evening.\n\nPakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit said:. \u201cNo visa application was submitted to us, this is what the reality is.\u201d\n\nMr. Kher tweeted: \u201cDear@abasitpak1, Reality remains that Pak Interior Ministry refused to grant NOC for my visa. 17 others invited also didn\u2019t apply for visa.\u201d",
