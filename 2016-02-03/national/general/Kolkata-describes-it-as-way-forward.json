    "text": "With only a few activists initially assembled before a prominent landmark here, the numbers swelled within hours and the mood grew celebratory when the news arrived that the Supreme Court on Tuesday referred a curative petition challenging Section 377 of the IPC to a five-judge constitution bench for hearing.\n\n\u201cLike many, I was apprehensive that the petition would be dismissed outright. Now that I am discovering the details of the order, I find positive signs. This is what we wanted to give a listening to our argument,\u201d Pawan Dhall, a sexual rights activist, told The Hindu .\n\nMr. Dhall, who was among those who assembled in front of the Academy of Fine Arts along with fellow activists, said the judgment \u201chas not been dismissive\u201d of the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community.\n\nRanjita Sinha, a transgender activist and member of the State transgender board said: \u201cI think it is a way forward. Now the matter has been pushed to a five-judge bench, we can hope for the best.\u201d",
