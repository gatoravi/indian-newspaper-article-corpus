The vitals are the states that have given support to terror. There must be adequate deterrence for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen states feel they can outsource the instrument of coercion to some of the non-state actors to achieve their political objectives, this has proven to be the most counter-productive method. All countries who have tried it have had it boomerang on them, and they have faced the brunt of their own terror groups,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Doval said the world must identify states that give terrorists \u201carms, funds, safe havens and support .\u201d\n\nEarlier, President Pranab Mukherjee spoke of \u201caddressing issues of ideology and dealing with countries that sponsor or support terrorism.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, Afghanistan\u2019s Chief Executive Dr. Abdullah Abdullah said it was necessary for a \u201cregional forum\u201d to counter terror in South Asia.\n\nSignificantly, no speakers are expected from Pakistan or Saudi Arabia at the conference attended by 350 delegates from 25 countries.",
