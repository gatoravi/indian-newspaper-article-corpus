Thakur and Justices Anil R. Dave and J.S. Khehar, hearing a batch of curative petitions against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, senior advocate Kabil Sibal said: \u201cAny provision that penalises an adult person\u2019s expression of consensual sexuality in private is significantly unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThere was a galaxy of senior lawyers representing the petitioners, including senior advocates K.K. Venugopal, Ashok Desai, Shyam Divan, Anand Grover and Colin Gonsalves.\n\nThe open court hearing was the fruit of two years of waiting since the batch of eight curative petitions was filed in March 2014 by parents, civil society, scientific and LGBT rights organisations against a January 28, 2014 apex court verdict dismissing their review petitions on the ground that Section 377 is Constitutional and applies to sexual acts irrespective of age or consent of the parties.\n\nThe Review Bench in January 2014 had agreed with its original appeal judgment on December 11, 2013, setting aside the historic and globally accepted verdict of the Delhi High Court. The High Court had declared Section 377 unconstitutional, and said it was in violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.\n\nThe High Court, led by its then Chief Justice A.P. Shah, had read down Section 377 to apply only to non-consensual, penile, non-vaginal sex, and sexual acts by adults with minors.\n\n\u201cYour past judgments not only affect the present but will bind future generations to a life of indignity and stigma,\u201d Mr. Sibal submitted. \u201cIf not corrected now, your verdicts may result in \u2018immense public injury,\u2019\u201d he argued.\n\nMr. Sibal, joined by Mr. Grover, appearing for petitioner Naz Foundation, argued that the apex court struck down the 2009 Delhi HC judgment despite the Centre not challenging the lower court\u2019s verdict.\n\n\u201cThe matter is of such importance that it should go to a five-judge bench,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur responded.\n\nMeanwhile, when Chief Justice Thakur asked if there was anyone opposing the petitioners, the Apostolic Churches Alliance made it clear that \u201chomosexuality is an abomination in the Bible\u201d and decriminalisation of Section 377 would lead to legalisation of homosexuality. It argued that such a situation would make the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act redundant. The petitioners have contended that homosexuality was not a mental disorder, but a normal and natural variant of human sexuality. Even the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) of the American Psychiatric Association, the globally accepted standards for classification of mental health, no longer considered non-peno-vaginal sex between consenting adults as mental disorders.",
