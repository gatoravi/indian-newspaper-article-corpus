Saif\u2019s body was the last to be retrieved by the search teams on Tuesday morning. \u201cThe family is yet to come to terms with the tragedy. He was alive and well a few hours before the mishap \u2026 and then he was no more,\u201d said a neighbour. Anger, recrimination and confusion permeated the tense atmosphere on the Abeda Inamdar College campus on Monday night with fraught parents and relatives of the students angrily questioning the authorities on how the group could venture into the sea despite the presence of teachers in the picnic.\n\n\u201cI am told my brother risked his life to save other students ... he was fond of cricket ... he died a hero\u2019s death,\u201d said Parvez Shaikh, younger brother of Iftekar Shaikh who died in the tragedy.\n\nThe tragedy has triggered a debate as to who was responsible for the accident. While heart-broken parents have accused the college authorities of \u2018negligence\u2019 for failing to dissuade the students from entering the treacherous waters, the college authorities deflected the blame on lack of adequate security personnel on the beach. \u201cThe tragedy might have been averted had there been enough lifeguards on the beach,\u201d said P.A. Inamdar, president of the Maharashtra Cosmopolitan Education Society which runs the college.\n\nAccording to some locals, the students plunged into the waters recklessly, ignoring warnings.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, the Deputy Director of Education has issued a circular prohibiting picnics around risky places.",
