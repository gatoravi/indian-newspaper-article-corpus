With a strong Buddhist undertone to it, the function was heavily attended by members of the Most Backward Castes, in particular, Kushwaha, Nishad, Saini and Maurya.\n\nCaste arithmetic\n\nThe JD(U) has already made overtures to some regional parties, Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Peace Party and Apna Dal\u2019s breakaway faction led by Krishna Patel, the wife of Kurmi leader Sone Lal Patel.\n\nThrough an alliance with the RLD, the JD(U) hopes to revive the Jat-Muslim combination, scarred by the 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal violence, in west U.P. While the Apna Dal commands support among Kurmis, a caste which Mr. Kumar belongs to, the Peace Party has Muslim support in pockets of Purvanchal.\n\n\u201cU.P. has more challenges than Bihar. Our fight is against the increasing communalism of the BJP. No party is in a position to defeat the BJP on its own,\u201d JD(U) general secretary K.C. Tyagi told The Hindu .\n\nIt plans to forge an anti-BJP alliance in the poll-bound State",
