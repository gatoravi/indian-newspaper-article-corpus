    "text": "The Bihar government on Tuesday decided to scrap the requirement that those who contest local government elections must have a toilet in his/her house, making a U-turn in its own policy.\n\n\u201cToday, the State Cabinet approved a proposal to provide relief to the poorest of the poor not having toilets at home, by ending the mandatory requirement of toilets for contesting the local body panchayat polls\u201d, Brajesh Mehrotra, Principal Secretary to the Cabinet Coordination Department said. The elections to the local bodies in the State are scheduled for March-April.\n\nIn August last year, the State government had, through an amendment to the Bihar State Panchayati Raj Act, 2006, provided for disqualification of a person wishing to contest panchayat elections if he/she did not have \u201cat least one toilet\u201d in the house by January 1, 2016.\n\nAccording to estimates, about 1.5 crore households in Bihar have no toilets, despite several Central and State government schemes for constructing toilets. \u201cMost of the cases of rape happen in the State when girls and women go out for answering nature\u2019s call in the dark\u201d, said a non-governmental organisation official working for toilet construction in the villages of north Bihar.\n\nThe Opposition BJP welcomed the government\u2019s move.",
