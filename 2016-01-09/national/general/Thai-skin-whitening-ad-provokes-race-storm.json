Another post said: \u201cHaving dark skin can be beautiful \u2014 without being ashamed as well.\u201d\n\nThere was also speculation that the advertisement was intentionally provocative as part of a marketing ploy to grab attention.\n\nCalculated strategy?\n\n\u201cI don't think the ad agency made this ad out of ignorance,\u201d a prominent Thai culture blogger, called Kaewmala on her thaiwomantalks.com website, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been living on the moon, I\u2019m certain they knew it would be controversial... It was most likely a calculated strategy, which in my view makes it even more objectionable.\u201d\n\nWhile there has been a growing awareness about racism among Thais in recent years, those views have yet to be reflected in a media, which still readily equates dark skin with \u201clow class\u201d, she added.\n\nSeoul Secret has yet to issue a public statement on its decision to remove the video. \u2014 AFP",
