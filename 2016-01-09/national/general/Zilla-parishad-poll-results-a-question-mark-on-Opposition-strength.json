    "text": "The most significant fact that emerges from the just held Zilla Parishad elections in Uttar Pradesh \u2013 that come just a year ahead of assembly elections \u2013 is that candidates of the ruling Samajwadi Party that won 60 of the 74 districts, won 36 of them unopposed: that would imply that the BJP (that won 71 of the State\u2019s 80 Lok Sabha seats in last year\u2019s Lok Sabha polls), the Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party either did not have candidates in these 36 districts or chose not to field anyone.\n\nSo, while it is a well-known fact that ruling parties tend to win local elections and that often has no bearing on Assembly or Lok Sabha polls (in 2010, the BSP that was in power, won ZP polls two years before being trounced in Assembly elections), staying out of the electoral fray would suggest lack of a strong organisation on the ground, especially for the BJP and the Congress.\n\nIndeed, the BJP appeared not to have a decent organisation in Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s constituency, just as the Congress did not have one in Amethi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency. In Varanasi, SP candidate Aparajita Sonkar defeated the BJP-Apna Dal combine candidate Amit Kumar Sonkar; in Amethi, the SP candidate was elected unopposed after the Congress candidate Krishna Chaurasiya withdrew his nomination, embarrassing his own party.\n\nA Congress leader from party vice president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency, Amethi, told The Hindu that he was shocked when the party\u2019s candidate from the district withdrew on the last day of withdrawal on January 4 in favour of the SP.\n\nIn the case of the BSP, a party whose voters tend to be from the most vulnerable and weaker sections, opting out of such local elections is more understandable. Also, the BSP can draw comfort from the fact that in last year\u2019s gram panchayat elections held in November, it made a splashy showing, announcing its return, a little over a year after it scored a duck in the 2014 LS elections. The ruling SP, on the other hand, did not do as well as expected.",
