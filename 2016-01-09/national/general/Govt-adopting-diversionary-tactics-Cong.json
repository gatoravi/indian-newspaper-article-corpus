    "text": "The Congress on Friday described the meeting Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu had with its president Sonia Gandhi to gather support for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill as a tactic to \u201cdistract\u201d the attention from the alleged mishandling of the Pathankot terror attack.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Naidu met Ms. Gandhi to discuss passage of the Bill in the budget session of Parliament. Senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil said Mr. Naidu had nothing new to say about the Bill. \u201cHe did not talk about the Congress\u2019s objections. He just said the government was considering our suggestions and would take a decision soon.\u201d\n\nRejecting the government\u2019s charge that the Congress was blocking the Bill, Mr. Gohil said it was the BJP government that had been following the RSS-driven plot of \u201csabotaging\u201d it. \u201cThe real truth is that the GST stands red-flagged for the past nine years by the RSS and its affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch,\u201d Mr. Gohil said.",
