The Home Ministry officials said The Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 only empowers the Central and State governments to order a probe and the Delhi government had no power to take any disciplinary action as it is not a 'full-state'.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, reasoned that the Commission was appointed in accordance with the law. In a flurry of tweets on Friday, Mr. Kejriwal said \u2014\u201cDDCA Enquiry Commission set up by Delhi Govt (government) is as per law and the Constitution of India. The Centre\u2019s opinion not binding on Del govt. The Commission will continue work. If LG (Lieutenant Governor) or MHA or PMO (Prime Minister Office) aggrieved, they may approach Court. Only a court order can stop commission\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung had asked the Centre for its opinion on the Commission of Inquiry, following which the Centre replied on Thursday that it was null and void and the Delhi government had no power to conduct such inquiry.\n\nThe Delhi government has appointed the former Solicitor General, Gopal Subramaniam, to head the probe panel.\n\nUnion Home Ministry has termed the inquiry commission\n\nnull and void",
