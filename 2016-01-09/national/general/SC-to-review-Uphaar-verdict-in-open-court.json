    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday decided to hear in open court the separate petitions filed by the CBI and the family members of the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy victims to review its judgment allowing real estate magnates Gopal and Sushil Ansal to get off by paying a fine of Rs. 60 crore for negligence leading to the death of 59 people in the incident.\n\nThe CBI contended that the Ansals should pay for their \u201ccallousness, greed and avarice\u201d with the jail sentence provided for criminal negligence under the law and not a Rs. 60 crore fine.\n\nA Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave, Kurian Joseph and A.K. Goel had spared them prison terms, though it had found the duo guilty of flouting public safety norms. However, the Bench, in chamber hearings, has now decided to review their judgment in open court. The date of the open-court hearing has not been fixed.\n\nThe Supreme court justified in its judgment that there was nothing \u201cfruitful\u201d in sending the Ansals to prison for their negligence. Countering this, the CBI blamed the \u201cIndian law for failing to keep pace with the needs of society by providing too lenient punishment for criminal negligence resulting in large casualties\u201d.\n\nCBI blames outdated law for providing too lenient punishment in Uphaar case",
