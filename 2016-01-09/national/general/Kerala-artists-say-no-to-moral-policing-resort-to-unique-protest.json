Our aim is to evolve a cultural means of protest that\u2019s consistent with the emerging socio-cultural narratives against dominant orthodox narratives,\u201d said Lasar Shine, as artists sculpted, painted and performed in protest at the Vanchi Square on the tri-junction near the High Court.\n\nArtist Chithra E.G. hid her face under thick cakes of clay and made masks at Vanchi Square in a performance, as inquisitive walkers stopped by. In another performance, Anupama Elias had her body covered with texts suggesting emotions and living beings, but her efforts to cull out \u2018love\u2019 was masked by P.S. Jalaja, who wrapped Anupama in a plastic sheet, leaving just the nose out for her to breathe.\n\nCampaign mascot\n\nArtists Anil Xavier, Manu C.A., and Arun Poulose, who had been hospitalised following the alleged attack, were joined by Jasinther Rockfeller in carving sculptures of Lisa Herzeline Raphael, the artist who had allegedly been verbally abused by the police on New Year. \u201cWe portrayed her as the icon, the mascot, of the campaign against moral policing,\u201d said artist Jalaja.\n\nDrawing inspiration from master painter Edward Munch\u2019s iconic work, The Scream, they sculpted Lisa even as her portraiture in pastel was done by painters, including Jalaja.\n\nA while later, Lisa, Anil, Arun, Jasinther, Manu and Vipin Dhanurdharan trapped themselves in an iron cage as some 150 artists and supporters took out a procession to the Commissioner\u2019s office. As the police stopped them on the way, they came out, cutting open the iron bars of the cage.",
