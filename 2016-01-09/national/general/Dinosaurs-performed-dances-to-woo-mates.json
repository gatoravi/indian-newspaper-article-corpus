Lockley\n\nPredatory dinosaurs performed a ritual, bird-like dance to woo their mates, according to paleontologists who have studied huge scrape marks left behind by the animals in western Colorado.\n\nPaleobiologists have long speculated that dinosaurs had mating rituals like those of their descendants, modern birds, but the scrapes would be the first physical evidence of \u201cdinosaur foreplay\u201d, lead scientist Martin Lockley said.\n\n\u201cWe know they had feathers and crests and good vision,\u201d Prof. Lockley said, speaking of theropods, the carnivore family of Tyrannosaurs rex .\n\n\u201cThey were visual animals, but there\u2019s never been any actual physical evidence that their anatomy and behavior was co-opted for fairly energetic display. This is physical evidence.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 50 scrape marks were found in 100m-year-old sandstone, in irregular groupings that look like the display arenas some birds gather in to compete for mates. The scrapes run in five- and six-foot patterns that resemble the traces left behind by courting birds.\n\nIn a paper published on Thursday in Scientific Reports , Prof. Lockley and his co-authors compared the patterns to those left by puffins and ostriches, and deduced that the marks did not represent nests or digging for water or food.\n\nProf. Lockley, a professor of geology with the University of Colorado Denver, said the scored and scratched patterns converged nicely with longstanding interpretations of dinosaur behaviour and the study of modern birds.\n\nHe added that he thought the dinosaurs made vocal sounds as birds do during their mating ceremonies. \u2014 \u00a9 Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016\n\nthe dinosaurs made vocal sounds as birds do during their mating ceremonies",
