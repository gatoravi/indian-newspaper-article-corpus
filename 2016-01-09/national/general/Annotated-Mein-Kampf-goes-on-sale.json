    "text": "An annotated edition of Mein Kampf , the first version of Adolf Hitler\u2019s notorious manifesto to be published in Germany since the end of World War II, went on sale on Friday.\n\nThe Munich-based Institute for Contemporary History has worked for several years on the plain-covered volume, officially titled Hitler, Mein Kampf \u2013 A Critical Edition . It launched the book days after the copyright of the German-language original expired at the end of 2015 70 years after Hitler\u2019s death.\n\nOver the years Bavaria\u2019s finance ministry had used its copyright on the book to prevent the publication of new editions. The book wasn\u2019t actually banned in Germany, though, and could be found online, in secondhand bookshops and in libraries.\n\nThe new edition \u201csets out as far as possible Hitler\u2019s sources, which were deeply rooted in the German racist tradition of the late 19th century,\u201d said the Munich institute\u2019s director, Andreas Wirsching. \u201cThis edition exposes the false information spread by Hitler, his downright lies and his many half-truths.\u201d \u2014 AP",
