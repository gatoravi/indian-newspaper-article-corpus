It was an admirable initiative to normalise bilateral ties,\u201d Mr. Kumar told mediapersons on Friday.\n\nHowever, just an hour later RJD chief Lalu Prasad slammed Mr. Modi. \u201cWhat happened to Mr. Modi\u2019s 56-inch chest which he earlier used to brag about? How did the terrorists enter our airbase? The BJP and the PM must explain,\u201d said Mr. Prasad here.\n\nAlliance partner Lalu slams PM for Pathankot attack",
