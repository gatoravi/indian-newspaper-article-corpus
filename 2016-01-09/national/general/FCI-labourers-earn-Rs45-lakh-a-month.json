    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday expressed shock at the revelation that labourers at the Food Corporation of India (FCI) earned a whopping Rs. 4.5 lakh as monthly wages, considerably more than the salary of the President of India.\n\nA Bench led by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur said the revelation was an example of the \u201cmalpractices\u201d in the FCI system. The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by the FCI Workers\u2019 Union against a series of directions passed by the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court on the basis of a scathing report on the FCI by a High Level Committee headed by senior BJP leader Shanta Kumar.\n\nThe Bench, while refusing to intervene in the High Court decision, said there had been \u201cRs.1,800 crore of loss per year\u201d to the FCI where departmental labourers engaged proxy workers.\n\n\u201cHow can a labourer carrying sacks earn Rs. 4.5 lakh per month? You (departmental labourers) are today earning wages more than that of the President of India,\u201d the Bench observed.",
