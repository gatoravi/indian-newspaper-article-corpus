A senior functionary of the government, however, said the notification has been issued without the Cabinet passing it. Sources say it was just mentioned at a Cabinet meeting without being on the agenda.\n\nA source in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, however, explained this by claiming that the notification just \u201cclarified\u201d the previous notification of 2011, an argument with uncertain legal standing.\n\nThe notification\u2019s bid to regulate the sport is being seen as an attempt not to attract accusations of sidestepping concerns altogether. \u201cWhat we have allowed is with safeguards ensuring that there is no cruelty to animals,\u201d Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.\n\nBJP spokespersons skirted the issue, with three national spokespersons choosing not to respond to the move.\n\nThe Congress on its part advised qualified caution.\n\n\u201cThe Congress respects traditional sports that have come down generations. The important issue, however, is to ensure there is no cruelty to animals and that the sport is safe for participants and onlookers. This is something the government must ensure,\u201d spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.\n\nWhile Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan of the BJP was seeking a government initiative to permit the event as Pongal comes, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi had early in 2015 said that jallikattu was a \u201cwestern concept,\u201d supporting the ban on the grounds that both animals and humans were killed because of it.\n\n\u2018Congress respects traditional sports... However, it is vital to prevent cruelty to animals\u2019",
