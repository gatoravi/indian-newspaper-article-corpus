    "text": "Days after the attack on a police station in Malda district during a rally of a minority organisation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said \u201clocal problems cannot be linked to communal tension.\u201d\n\nShe, however, did not mention the incident.\n\nHer comments come on a day when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) demanded that the State government publish a \u2018White Paper\u2019 on the incident.\n\n\u201cA police station was set ablaze in an area like Kaliachak where opium smuggling and printing of fake Indian currency notes take place. The State government should immediately seek a report from the Superintendent of Police concerned,\u201d RSS West Bengal unit secretary Jishnu Basu said here on Friday.\n\n\u2018Were case diaries burnt?\u2019\n\nCriticising the Trinamool Congress for not \u201cdoing enough\u201d on the issue, Mr. Basu also said the report should mention how many firearms were stolen from the police station and how many case diaries burnt.\n\n\u2018Kaliachak attack is tantamount to waging war against the state\u2019",
