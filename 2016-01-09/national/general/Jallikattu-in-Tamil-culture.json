    "text": "How far is \u2018jallikattu\u2019 a part of Tamil culture and ancient tradition? A translation of Kalitogai , a major work in Sangam literature by A.K. Ramanujan, gives a vivid description of the ancient sport known as \u2018Eru Thazuval\u2019: \u201cThat the bull is wilder than an elephant gone wild; do not loosen your hand\u2019s grip on him, and the shoulders of our girl will bring you victory flags.\u201d\n\nNoted historian A.L. Basham in his book, \u2018The Wonder that is India\u2019 says the bullfight was seen as a test of manhood. However, he hastens to add that \u201cthough Tamil literature gives no evidence of this, the bullfight had certainly some ritual significance.\u201d\n\nBasham also appears to note that far from being associated with glory, it was a gory sport.",
