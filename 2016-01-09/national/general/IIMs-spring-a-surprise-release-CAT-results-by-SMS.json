    "text": "The Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) sprung a surprise on candidates who took the Common Admission Test 2015 by sending their percentiles on Friday afternoon via SMS, with no prior announcement on the date of the declaration of results.\n\nThe official CAT website (iimcat.ac.in) put out a notice saying: \u201cCAT 2015 percentile is sent to the candidates through SMS. Score cards will be available by 8th Jan. 2016 evening.\u201d Soon after this, the scorecard was enabled on the website for viewing. The CAT, which was conducted by IIM-Ahmedabad, was held on November 29, 2015.\n\nCandidates, who received the SMSes, said they had only been told that the results would be announced some time in the second week of January, but had not expected the results to be declared without prior notice. Rajesh Kumar was in office when he received the SMS, which simply stated: \u201cDear candidate, your percentile for CAT 2015 for application number XX is XX. Regards, IIM CAT.\u201d\n\n\u201cI initially thought it was a prank because there were rumours doing the rounds that the results had been leaked. But I realised the message was from the same number that had sent us the password for our application. That is when I realised it was actually my result,\u201d he said.",
