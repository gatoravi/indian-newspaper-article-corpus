    "text": "The banking system came to a grinding halt on Friday with nearly 3.50 lakh employees owing allegiance to the All India Bank Employees\u2019 Association (AIBEA) taking part in the nationwide strike. As a result, customers were unable to deposit or withdraw cash in branches. The strike also affected other basic services.\n\n21 lakh cheques uncleared\n\nAbout 21 lakh cheques worth about Rs.16,000 crore could not be cleared, said AIBEA general secretary C.H. Venkatachalam.\n\nThe strike was to protest against the actions of five associate banks (State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur) that went against the industry-level settlement on wages and service conditions signed in June 2015.\n\n\u201cThe strike was forced on us because of the adamant approach of the management. We hope that the government and the Indian Banks\u2019 Association will resolve the demands of the employees,\u201d Mr. Venkatachalam said.\n\nAIBEA officials claimed that the strike was a total success in major metros and in secondary cities. The office-bearers will meet in Chennai on January 13 to take further decision.",
