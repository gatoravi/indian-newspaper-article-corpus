    "text": "The Judicial First Class Magistrate Court here on Friday issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Mahendra Singh Dhoni for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Hindus by posing as Lord Vishnu on the cover page of a magazine.\n\nA case was filed by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist, Y. Shyam Sunder, from Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh in April 2013, stating that the cover page of the magazine carried a picture of Mr. Dhoni posing as Lord Vishnu with his hands holding various products of a brand which he endorsed. Mr. Dhoni has been summoned before the court.\n\nThe court here on Friday took into account the fact that Mr. Dhoni had not appeared before the court and issued an NBW. However, the other accused in the case, editor of Business Today magazine, Chaitanya Kalbag, is yet to be served summons. The petitioner had urged the court to try the accused under Section 200 of the Cr.PC and Sections 295A, 298 and 499 of the IPC.",
