The CSR initiative in Palghar was being undertaken by the Nuclear Power Corporation Limited for construction of roads in the remote regions of Dahanu taluka.\n\n\u201cMassive irregularities were found in road works carried out by Meghana Enterprises. While much of the road work was never done, Rs 21.78 lakh was pocketed by the gram sevaks and sarpanch with the help of the engineers. We have ordered an FIR after hearing all sides. There is very little monitoring of CSR funds in the village areas, and the system must be improved by various auditing mechanisms,\u201d a Lokayukta official said.\n\nActivists working in the region say in the absence of sustained funding from the government for local works, CSR activities are a much-needed relief to complete smaller projects.\n\nHowever, they are not monitored efficiently by the district authorities. \u201cIn Thane and Palghar districts, development is continuous, carried out with the help of local people and non-profit organisations working with CSR funds in the area. There is little or no monitoring of how these funds are spent,\u201d said forest rights activist Milind Thatte.",
