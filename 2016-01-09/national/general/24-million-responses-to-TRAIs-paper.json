    "text": "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has received an unprecedented 2.4 million responses on its consultation paper about differential pricing for data services by telecom operators that triggered a shrill debate over Facebook\u2019s Free Basics platform that proposes to offer free access to a bouquet of websites and applications to its users.\n\nFacebook\u2019s effort to drum up support for Free Basics, accompanied by a high-pitched advertising campaign, has yielded 18.94 lakh responses from its users to the regulator, but it is not clear if they will be considered for consultation.\n\nStressing that consultation papers are not opinion polls, TRAI chairman R.S. Sharma had extended the December 31 deadline for comments by a week, in order to allow lakhs of Free Basics supporters to reframe their comments as simply saying \u2018I love Free Basics\u2019 didn\u2019t constitute a response to its questions.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 13.5 lakh comments received through @supportfreebasics.in \u2026 and these are basically template responses and the contents are identical in nature. These responses do not contain the individual e- mail IDs of the senders or their name,\u201d TRAI said in a statement on Friday evening, adding that only mobile phone numbers had been shared of such senders.\n\nWhile another 5.44 lakh comments emanated from facebookmail.com accounts, just one of them answered the questions raised by TRAI and a few conveyed that they did not support Free Basics.\n\n\u201cMost of these responses are in support of a specific product \u2018Free basics\u2019, even though the consultation paper had not raised any issue on such specific product without addressing the questions raised in the consultation paper,\u201d TRAI said.\n\nDifferential pricing is just one component of Free Basics and there could be many more products built using the strategy, Mr. Sharma had told The Hindu on December 31. TRAI\u2019s consultation paper is about whether such architecture should be allowed.\n\nNet neutrality activists, fervently arguing against services like Free Basics, also sent 4.84 lakh comments through fora such as Save The Internet opposing differential pricing for data services. Though those responses are also in template form, most have addressed the questions asked by TRAI. Another 2,000 responses have been received from individuals, half of which are identical in nature.\n\nWhile telecom firms, including Reliance Communications which had put its Free Basics offering on hold, asked the regulator to let market forces prevail in order to expand connectivity, larger industry groupings were split down the middle on the idea.\n\nTelecom industry groups backed the differentiation of price on the grounds that it improves economic efficiency, fosters competition and benefits consumers, Internet service providers.",
