    "text": "The Surat police on Friday filed a charge sheet in a local court against the Patel quota agitation leader, Hardik Patel, charging him with sedition during and after the stir in which 11 persons were killed in police firing.\n\nThe police said Hardik, 22, lodged in a Surat jail, had incited violence against the police, asked his followers to damage public property and made inflammatory speeches. They submitted a CD containing call records of Hardik and his aides and taped conversations in which they were heard asking the members of the community to use violence, when necessary, to press their demand for OBC status and a quota in education and government jobs.\n\nHardik was arrested by the Surat police in October after a video clip surfaced, purporting to show him advising a distressed youth to \u201ckill 3-4 policemen instead of committing suicide.\u201d Later, the Ahmedabad police arrested him and his top aides on the charge of sedition.\n\nAfter the High Court rejected his bail petition, he approached the Supreme Court, which set the January 8 deadline for filing a charge sheet against him.\n\nIn July 2015, the Hardik-led Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti launched an aggressive agitation against the BJP government of Anandiben Patel.",
