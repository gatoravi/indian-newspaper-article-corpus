We\u2019ve to see how much techno-savvy we can make the Bar, the Bench and the courts by using digital technology in their functioning and help work towards improving the quality of judgments.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarlier, a lot of time was spent doing research in the legal field, but today Google is a bar member which digs out what you need for your cases,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\nPM flags off rail projects\n\nIn another programme in Chhaukia village in Hajipur of Vaishali district, Mr. Modi flagged off railway projects and said India could not be a developed country unless its eastern States made progress. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to the development of the eastern States\u2026The nerve centre of India\u2019s development lies in eastern India\u2026 For India\u2019s sustainable development, it is important that the eastern States develop.\u201d He also thanked Mr. Kumar for extending support to the Centre for Bihar\u2019s development. While listing the priorities of projects of his government for Bihar like providing gas connectivity and electricity to every household, Mr. Modi said that in the past 18 months, his government had completed 34 per cent of unfulfilled projects in Bihar.\n\nWhen Mr. Kumar thanked Mr. Modi for visiting Bihar and hoping that he would keep coming to the State for its development, some people kept chanting Modi\u2026Modi\u2026Modi. The Prime Minister himself had to get up from his chair and asked them to sit down.",
