The statues date back to the 8th Century A.D. and the 10th Century A.D.\n\nThe seizure comes days before the March 15 \u2018Asia Week New York\u2019 festivities, as part of which Christie\u2019s is organising the auction titled \u2018The Lahiri Collection: Indian and Himalayan Art, Ancient and Modern\u2019.\n\nThe artefacts are a buff sandstone statue of Rishabhanata, believed to be from Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh belonging to the 10th Century A.D. It depicts the first Jain Tirthankara and is valued at approximately $1,50,000 (Rs.1 crore). The second artefact is a buff sandstone panel depicting Revanta, a rare representation of an equestrian deity. It dates back to the 8th Century A.D. and is valued at approximately $300,000.\n\nThe statue of Rishbhanata appears to have been sold to London-based Brandon Lynch Ltd between 2006 \u2013 2007. Christie\u2019s said that it would never knowingly offer a stolen work of art and it was cooperating with authorities. \u2014 PTI",
