Srikrishna said that it had been challenged on several occasions even before it had become the subject of recent controversy.\n\nSpeaking at an event organised at IIT Bombay, and in response to a question about whether the law on sedition interferes with the right to free speech, he said the courts in India had adopted a British era federal court stand on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen the British introduced the law on sedition their version was that anybody who said anything that generated disaffection with the elected government was guilty of sedition. The High Courts upheld this, but the federal court took a different view, saying that unless people were incited toward an act of violence it was not sedition,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile the case went to the Privy Council at the time, which upheld the earlier views of the High Courts that merely saying anything against the British government amounted to sedition, Mr. Srikrishna said a case regarding sedition came up before the Supreme Court soon after independence. \u201cThe Supreme Court read down the law and said that the decision of the federal court was right,\u201d he said.",
