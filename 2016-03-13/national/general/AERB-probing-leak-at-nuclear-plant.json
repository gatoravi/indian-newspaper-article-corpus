There is no increase in radiation level,\u201d Lalit Kumar Jain, Director of the plant, said on Saturday. He said two experts from the AERB had arrived at the plant to take stock of the situation and help plant engineers in the normalisation process.\n\nAccording to Mr. Jain, the radiation level is being constantly monitored.\n\n\u201cThe probe is to identify the cause of the leakage in the primary heat transport system [PHTS],\u201d he said.The leakage occurred in one of the operation units at the plant as another unit has been shut for maintenance since July 2015.\n\nNPCIL probe\n\nNuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) will investigate what led to the rupture in a feeder pipe in the heavy water system, which led to the spilling of heavy water on the floor of the reactor building on Friday. Following the incident, a plant emergency was declared. The plant emergency signifies a heightened state of alert for the plant personnel and management.\n\n\u201cThese feeder pipes, which carry heavy water, are made of high-grade carbon steel. We will do a metallurgical examination [of what led to the rupture in one of the pipes]. It is not a phenomenon which is frequent ... But the fact that all the safety systems came into operation immediately after the leak of the heavy water and the reactor was shut down automatically proves the robustness of the system,\u201d said N. Nagaich, Director (Human Resources), NPCIL.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure of one component. We will investigate how it happened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NPCIL is tasked with building, operating and decommissioning nuclear reactors. There are two indigenously built Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), each of 220 MWe capacity, operating at Kakrapar in Vyara district of Gujarat, about 80 km from Surat. These PHWRS use natural uranium as the fuel. Heavy water acts both as a coolant and moderator in the reactor.\n\nMr. Nagaich said there was \u201cno cause for worry\u201d and it had been \u201cestablished\u201d that there was no release of radiation into the atmosphere. Several samples had been taken from the environment and \u201cthey indicated that there is no rise in the radioactivity levels either in the plant site or outside,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday, the situation is that the reactor is under cold shutdown. The [natural uranium] fuel core has been cooled. The coolant temperature has come down. It is around 30 degrees centigrade. It has come to normal temperature,\u201d Mr. Nagaich said on Saturday.\n\nAbout 2,500 tonnes of ordinary/light water was used for long-term cooling of the natural uranium fuel core. This had led to the temperature of the fuel core coming down.\n\nWhen contacted, S. Harikumar, Secretary, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), which keeps a watch on safety in nuclear establishments in the country, said on Saturday that \u201cthings are close to normal\u201d at Kakrapar-1. The situation was under control and \u201cplant parameters are almost normal\u201d.\n\nThere are 306 small feeder pipes in the reactor system and they carry heavy water. Each feeder pipe has a diameter of about an inch and a half. Around 9 a.m. on Friday (March 11, 2016), when the reactor was generating its full power of 220 MWe, one of the feeder pipes ruptured, which led to the leak of heavy water, and its spilling on the floor of the reactor building. The reactor tripped immediately. Several safety systems kicked in and the reactor shut down automatically. The safety systems performed according to design. Cooling systems sprayed water on the fuel core, to ward off any possibility of the fuel core from melting. Asked how many tonnes of heavy water leaked into the reactor building, Mr. Nagaich said: \u201cWe will estimate it now. The first priority was the safe shutdown of the reactor. All safety systems are under close watch.\u201d\n\nAutomatic shutdown\n\nWhat was significant, he said, was that the reactor shut down automatically, all the safety systems came into operation and there was no radiological consequence. As part of laid-down procedures, the management and plant personnel were alerted. A plant emergency was declared and the staff members were asked to be available at the plant site.\n\nAnil Kakodkar, former Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, said what was important was that after the heavy water leak occurred, \u201cthe safety systems of the reactor took over and acted according to design.\u201d\n\nPlant authorities say all safety systems kicked in soon after the leak was detected",
