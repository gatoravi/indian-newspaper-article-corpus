The video showed one boy completely naked and the other with only a shirt on his body crying incessantly and trying to cover their private parts with their hands.\n\nThe video, which was shared widely, reached some police officials, and the Malwani police were instructed to look into the matter. Inquiries in the area helped the police trace the boys, and the police spoke to their families.
