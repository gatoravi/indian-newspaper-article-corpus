But the new strategy has helped my Ministry cut down the time for various clearances to an average of 190 days. We intend to further improve this to 100 days in the next one year,\u201d Mr. Javadekar said at a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.\n\nHe said during the UPA regime, the time-consuming process of environment clearances for big investment projects led to delays, stunting growth, increased unemployment, a large number of incomplete projects, and a sharp increase in non performing assets of banks.\n\n\u201cThe Environment Ministry had earned the nickname of Roadblock or Speedbreaker Ministry. Our sustainable development policies will increase investment inflow, ensure completion of projects on time, boost employment and development without compromising with environment. We don\u2019t just believe in Ease of Doing Business, but Ease of Doing Responsible Business,\u201d said the Minister, who, earlier in the day also delivered the keynote address at the 11th National Convention on Sustainable Development Goals held in Mumbai.\n\nMr. Javadekar told journalists that the Modi government was committed to sustainable development. He said climate change was a reality with one degree of temperature rise caused by 150 years of uncontrolled carbon emissions by the developed world.",
