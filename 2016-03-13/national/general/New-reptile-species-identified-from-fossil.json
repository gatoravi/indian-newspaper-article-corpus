    "text": "Scientists have discovered a new fossil reptile that lived 250 million years ago in Brazil, which may help understand the origins of dinosaurs, flying reptiles and crocodiles.\n\nThe species has been identified from a mostly complete and well-preserved fossil skull that the team has named Teyujagua paradoxa .\n\nThe fossil was discovered last year by a team from the Paleobiology Laboratory of the Federal University of Pampa (Unipampa) in Brazil, in a Triassic rock exposure near Sao Francisco de Assis.\n\nThe discovery helps clarify the initial evolution of the group that gave rise to dinosaurs, pterosaurs (flying reptiles), crocodiles and birds. Teyujagua is very different from other fossils from the same age. Its anatomy is intermediate between the more primitive reptiles and a diverse and important group called \u2018archosauriformes\u2019, researchers said.\n\nArchosauriformes include all the extinct dinosaurs and pterosaurs, along with modern-day birds and crocodiles.\n\nThe discovery of Teyujagua is important because it lived just after the great Permo-Triassic mass extinction event that occurred 252 million years ago. Archosauriforms and their close kin like Teyujagua became the dominant animals in ecosystems on land and eventually gave rise to dinosaurs.\n\nTeyujagua was a small, quadrupedal animal, and grew up to about 1.5 metres in length. Its teeth were recurved with fine serrations and sharply pointed, indicating a carnivorous diet.\n\nThe nostrils were placed on the upper part of the snout, a typical feature of some aquatic or semi-aquatic animals, such as modern day crocodiles. \u2014 PTI\n\nTeyujagua paradoxa helps scientists understand the evolution of various species",
