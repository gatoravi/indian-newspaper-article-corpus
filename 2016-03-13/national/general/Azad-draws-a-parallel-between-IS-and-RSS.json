    "text": "RSS threatens legal action, BJP seeks apology\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday sparked off a controversy when he drew an equivalence between the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) the ideological mentors of the ruling BJP and the terror outfit Islamic State (IS).\n\nHe was speaking at an event organised by the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind and his remarks prompted a furious reaction from both the RSS, which threatened legal action, and the BJP, which demanded an apology from Mr. Azad.\n\n\u201cSo, we oppose organisations like IS, the way we oppose the RSS. If those among us in Islam too do wrong things, they are no way less than the RSS,\u201d Mr. Azad had said in his speech. During his speech, Mr. Azad made a strong case for fighting communalism of \u201call types,\u201d whether indulged in by Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs, as they are a \u201cthreat to the world and the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey create distances between a man and another. Let them be of any religion, we will have to fight them. Hence, all the secularist forces need to come together to eliminate these forces. The fight is between communalism and secularism; let\u2019s see whether communalism wins or the secularism,\u201d he said. \u201cIndia belongs to all religions, which means majority is with us,\u201d he added.\n\nBJP demands apology\n\nThe RSS, whose top leadership is meeting at a conclave in Nagaur in Rajasthan said \u201cAzad comparing the IS with the RSS exhibits the intellectual bankruptcy of the Congress and its unwillingness to deal with fundamentalist and cruel forces like the IS.\u201d\n\nThe BJP demanded an apology from Mr. Azad for defaming the RSS which it termed a \u201cnationalist\u201d organisation.",
