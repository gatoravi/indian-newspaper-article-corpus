They were later rescued by Army personnel.\n\nReports of moderate snowfall were also received from other high altitude areas, including the Amarnath cave shrine and \u2018Peer Ki Gali\u2019 in south, Sonamarg and Zojilla Pass in central, and adjoining areas, the officials said.\n\nThe maximum temperature in Srinagar was 10.8 degrees Celsius, a drop of almost 10 degrees since Friday.\n\nThe night temperature also dropped to 4.4 degrees Celsius from 8.5 degrees Celsius on Friday.\n\nRescue mission\n\nAn Army team launched a rescue mission on Friday night in Tangdhar at Nasta Chhun Pass after it received information about stranded vehicles full of passengers including women, children and the elderly, and an ambulance with a critically-ill heart patient, an Army spokesman said on Friday. Incessant rain and heavy snowfall in higher reaches of Tangdhar triggered avalanches on Tangdhar-Nasta Chhun road, causing road blocks at various places, the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThe Army\u2019s avalanche rescue team of Nasta Chhun Pass immediately sprang into action in the wake of harsh weather conditions, snow blizzard and zero visibility \u201d, the spokesman said. \u2014 PTI",
