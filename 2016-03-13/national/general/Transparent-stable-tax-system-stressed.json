Narayana Murthy said here on Saturday that reducing friction for conducting business and creating an easy to comply with tax system can help shore up the Human Development Index (HDI) of the country.\n\nHe also called for jailing people, who do not pay tax as it is used to create infrastructure and facilities for the poor.\n\nIn an interaction programme with students of the National Institute of Engineering (NIE), Mr. Murthy said making it easier to do business and reducing friction will facilitate faster growth of businesses and encourage both domestic and foreign investors to invest in entrepreneurs in India, thus leading to creation of more jobs and better income.\n\nHe underlined the importance of creating an easy to comply with, transparent and stable tax system, which will go after tax collection in a very rigorous way and punish people who do not pay tax.\n\nCiting a 1980s case of Leona Hemsley of the U.S., who was jailed for tax evasion, Mr. Murthy said \u201cPerhaps she ignored paying tax imaging she was a very big person like our friend Vijay Mallya.\u201d\n\nIf the tax laws are easy to comply with and the evaders are punished, then there will be no problem of taxes, said Mr. Murthy in the context of reports that the amount of tax under contention in India was huge.\n\n\u201cUse the part of the tax collected to build infrastructure for the country to pave way for growth of businesses and invest in providing basic education, health, nutrition and shelter for the poor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Jail people who do not pay tax as it\n\nis used to create facilities for\n\nthe poor\u2019",
