    "text": "\u201cInadequate allocation for education and lack of priority for education in the government policy during the preceding years have left open this field to institutions aiming for profits,\u201d the resolution said.\n\nIt made no reference to \u201canti-national\u201d activities on campuses, a key RSS theme that also figured in the report of Sangh general secretary Suresh (Bhaiyyaji) Joshi on Friday. RSS Akhil Bharatiya Sampark Pramukh Aniruddha Deshpande refused to discuss the issue at his press conference.\n\nThe resolution, however, did call for value-based, nationalistic, employment-oriented and skill-based education for each child.\n\nThe health resolution called for medical facilities in small towns and villages and made out a case for more philanthropic health care efforts. It also called for medicines to be brought within the reach of the people.\n\nWhile there was much emphasis on social justice and a call to end caste discrimination, an insider said he had not yet seen the draft of any resolution on the issue.",
