Two years later it acquired the then low-cost Air Deccan. It was grounded in October 2012 by its chairman Vijay Mallya due to non-availability of funds. It lost the flying permit in December 2012.\n\nAccording to the letter, there were about 7,000 direct as well as indirect employees who were affected by the closure of Kingfisher Airlines and a majority of them cannot even afford to fight it out in courts. \u2014 PTI",
