This will give them more say in collective decisions at the IMF,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\nReforms an on-going process, says Modi\n\nReform of global institutions should be an on-going process, he said, which must reflect changes in the global economy, and the rising share of emerging economies.\n\n\u201cEven now, IMF quotas do not reflect the global economic realities.\u201d The change in quotas was not an issue of increasing the \u201cpower\u201d of certain countries. It was an issue of fairness and legitimacy.\n\nHe also welcomed the IMF's decision to finalise the next round of quota changes by October 2017.",
