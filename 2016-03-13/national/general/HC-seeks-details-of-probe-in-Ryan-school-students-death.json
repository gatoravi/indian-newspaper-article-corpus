    "text": "The Delhi High Court has sought details of investigation into the death of a six-year-old student at Ryan International School in Vasant Kunj recently.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) will appear in person in the court next week to submit a detailed status report. Justice Siddharth Mridul of the High Court, hearing a writ petition moved by the boy's father, asked the senior police officer to remain present in the court on March 18, when arguments will be heard on the petitioner\u2019s allegation that the police officers probing the death were acting in connivance with the school management.\n\nPetitioner Ramhet Meena said the police, in an attempt to protect the school management, had intentionally registered the first information report under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) instead of Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code. The petitioner's counsel Aditya Aggarwal submitted that the court may order incorporation of Section 302 in the case and hand over the investigation to an independent body, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nDivyansh, a student of Class I at the school, was found dead on January 30 in the water tank on the school campus.",
