The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are northwest of the Strait of Malacca, offering control of a so-called choke point that is one of China\u2019s greatest marine vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is also testimony to the unfolding relationship between India and Japan, which is also funding a $744 million road building project in the northeastern Indian border regions of Mizoram, Assam and Meghalaya. Like the Andaman and Nicobar chain, the northeastern region is a strategic area that has remained relatively undeveloped because of its separation from the mainland.\n\nJapan\u2019s marshalling of official development assistance in the region has drawn less attention than the effort that China calls \u201cOne Belt, One Road,\u201d a network of roads, railways and ports intended to link China to the rest of Asia and to Europe.\n\nBut it fits logically into the web of strategic projects taking shape as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi enters into closer relationships with Japan, Australia and the United States, as well as regional powers like Vietnam, to counter China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nA senior Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said China\u2019s project would be answered by \u201ca more decentralised, local but organic response.\u201d\n\nThe official described proposed infrastructure projects in the Andamans as \u201cnot of a big scale, and not of a big value,\u201d but added that New Delhi was intent on developing its \u201cfrontier\u201d regions.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the frontier should be left undeveloped, I think people have rejected that approach,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u201cThere is a realisation that it doesn\u2019t help to leave part of any part of India undeveloped.\u201d Japan\u2019s vision for contributions in the island chain goes far beyond the proposed power plant.\n\nThe plan was submitted in Tokyo more than a year after Japan\u2019s Ambassador made a visit to Port Blair on South Andaman Island and, in a meeting with the territory\u2019s top official, offered financing for \u201cbridges and ports.\u201d\n\nAkio Isomata, Minister for Economic Affairs in the Japanese Embassy, said the country\u2019s aid agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency, could only respond to \u201cformal requests\u201d from the Indian government.\n\nHe said Japan would consider \u201cany other requests\u201d on the Andaman and Nicobar chain or elsewhere and was eager to use official development assistance to enhance India\u2019s \u201cconnectivity\u201d with countries that were members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe usually start with small projects and go bigger,\u201d he said. \u2014 New York Times News Service\n\nBid to counter China\u2019s efforts to expand its maritime\n\nreach into the Indian Ocean",
