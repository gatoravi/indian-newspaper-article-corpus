    "text": "Google is about to embark on an old-school search, swapping its Internet algorithm for a custom-built van that will cruise across the U.S. to find out how people use its online services and react to new features.\n\nThe white van emblazoned with Google\u2019s colourful logo and an invitation to \u201cshape the future\u201d of the world\u2019s most powerful Internet company is scheduled to pull out Monday on a six-week road trip.\n\nGoogle is using the van to help it break out of its Silicon Valley bubble. The van will make multiday stops in seven states, stopping near colleges, libraries, parks and some of Google\u2019s own regional offices in hopes of finding out how average Americans are using the company\u2019s multitude of digital offerings.\n\nAbout 500 walk-up volunteers will be invited to step inside the van designed to serve as a mini-version of Google\u2019s Silicon Valley laboratories, where most of the company\u2019s user studies are conducted.\n\nOnce inside, researchers will watch, question and record how the volunteers use apps and other services on their smartphones in sessions that will last 15 to 90 minutes. They will receive gift cards and Google t-shirts in return for their time.\n\nA few may even get a glimpse at ideas that Google\u2019s engineers are still refining before the company decides whether to release them as products to the public.\n\nThe plan to build a research lab on wheels grew out of Google\u2019s recognition that most people don\u2019t live and think the same way as the population living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the company does most of its user research. In this geeky and affluent area, the day\u2019s biggest worry sometimes boils down to how long it will take to summon a Uber ride.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to understand the whole end-to-end experience, which is why we are trying to get out to more locations and see more people so we can gather more context,\u201d says Laura Granka, a lead Google researcher focusing on Internet search and maps. \u2014 AP",
