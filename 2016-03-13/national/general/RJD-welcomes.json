If the Centre and the Bihar Government work closely, the State will make progress and India can progress,\u201d PM Modi said.\n\nBJP leaders from Bihar who are in the Modi Cabinet, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Ravi Shankar Prasad, told journalists that \u201cwe all should work together for the development of Bihar and if Nitish Kumar is cooperating with the Central Government we must welcome it.\u201d\n\nThe Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Mr Kumar\u2019s coalition partner, welcomed the personal chemistry. RJD leader and Finance Minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui said: \u201cThe Prime Minister should be impartial to everyone and that is what I found in him today.\u201d\n\nHis party, however, struck a discordant note and was unhappy at party chief Lalu Prasad not being invited for the Hajipur function.\n\nThe Congress also was not impressed. \u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s speech was more political in nature,\u201d party leader Sadanand Singh said.",
