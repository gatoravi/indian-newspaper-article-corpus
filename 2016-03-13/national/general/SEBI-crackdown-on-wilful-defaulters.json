    "text": "Reacting to the decision by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to ban wilful defaulters from tapping the capital market, Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader, financial services at consulting firm EY, says the SEBI\u2019s strictures on wilful defaulters, though conceptually correct, have serious limitations as it pre-requisites banks to be judicious in their call on such entities.\n\n\u201cThe RBI guidelines state that funds diversion by a defaulter classifies as wilful. Given that our bad debt problem has been built over years of successive CDRs [corporate debt restructuring] and restructurings where additional debt raised for growth was used for interest payments to protect NPAs [non-performing assets], pricing diversion is easy not realising that some of these may be conscious. Also, one bank can declare a defaulter wilful when the fact that such diversion was known or not at the time of sanction can never be proven,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has decided to significantly increase its activities related to investor education and awareness, and plans to appoint at least one \u2018resource person\u2019 in each district for conducting such programmes on a regular basis in all areas.\n\nIn the financial year 2016-17, the SEBI also plans to encourage delisting of suspended companies, strengthen its surveillance mechanism, enhance the functioning of credit-rating agencies and encourage the use of technology to streamline \u2018know your customer\u2019 procedure\n\nIn another move that would help investors take a better informed decision, the capital market watchdog has said companies will have to disclose the impact of all remarks \u2014 qualifications in accounting parlance \u2014 in a separate statement along with the annual financial statements. While the new mechanism will be applicable from the financial year ending March 31, 2016, the management of a company will have the right to give its views on the qualifications along with the impact.",
