They hail from various parts of Saurashtra, which has a long coastline.\n\nOver 500 fishermen are still languishing in Pakistani jails. They were held by the Pakistan Marine Security Agency while fishing along the International Maritime Boundary Line. The PMSA patrols the coastline in Pakistan. \u201cBesides the fishermen, 891 boats of Gujarati fishermen are in the custody of Pakistan,\u201d said Manish Lodhari, secretary of an advocacy group working for the welfare of fishermen in the State. Each boat cost Rs. 40-45 lakh and fishermen suffered as the boats and trawlers were not returned.\n\nEarlier, the government used to offer financial assistance to those whose boats were seized by the PMSA.\n\n\u201cBetween 2003 and 2007, 326 boats were seized by Pakistan. The then government offered Rs. 11 lakh each to 200 owners who boats were seized. But that scheme is no long operating,\u201d Mr. Lodhari said.\n\nRecently, Gujarat officials visited Pakistan to inspect 22 boats that Pakistan agreed to release.\n\nThey were arrested by the authorities while fishing along the International Maritime Boundary Line",
