    "text": "Cost of making the film to be twice that of India\u2019s most expensive films, about USD 50 million\n\nThree young film-makers have come together to make a film in English on the Ramayana for a global audience.\n\nDirectors Vineet Sinha and Sean Graham with Creative Director Ronnie Allman from the U.S .want to recreate \u201cRamayana\u201d using latest film technology.\u201cHollywood, Japan and China make and market their stories such as Batman , Superman , Star Wars and Pokemon to the whole world. But Indian stories are not as well known,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.\n\nMr. Graham said they want to narrate the tale in 3D and Imax formats.\n\nThe biggest challenge is to balance the expectations of the audience both in India and abroad, said the film-makers.\n\n\u201cWe want this film to appeal to the fantasy action adventure audience who watch Lord of the Rings or Planet of the Apes . We are also making sure people at home (India) don\u2019t feel too distanced with our portrayal,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.\n\nMr. Allman said, \u201cCreating a world that is thousands of years old means heavy designs. We have to make sure we are keeping true to the time, while also adding our own spin on things. The biggest challenge has also been the most fun to figure out. How do you get a Rakshasa (demon) to fly in the air after being hit by Hanuman\u2019s gada (mace),\u201d he added.\n\nThe film-makers visualise Ravana differently. \u201cWe believe he (Ravana) was a very wise, rational, caring, creative, strict and humorous ruler. We see his ten heads as ten human characteristics that everyone possesses,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u2014 PTI",
