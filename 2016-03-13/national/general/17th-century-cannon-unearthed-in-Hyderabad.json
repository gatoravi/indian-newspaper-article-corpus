At 2 a.m. I got a call. I immediately rushed and asked them to remove it carefully and keep it aside and I alerted the police about it,\u201d said Mohammed Hanif.\n\nBut unlike the cannon that was discovered last year only a few yards away in Naya Pul which was cast in bronze, this one is cast iron. The seven-foot iron cannon with encrustations caused by time has not yet been inspected by the State Department of Archaeology and Museum. \u201cAs the police have taken custody of the cannon, we are not worried about its safety and we will inspect and take custody on Monday,\u201d said an ASI official.\n\nThrough the day, visitors thronged the area as the news spread about the cannon being unearthed in the open area behind the AD 1762 era Masjid e Buland Haji Moulana.\n\nProbably mounted on the old wall that girdled Hyderabad, the spot of the cannon is also closer to Petla Burj, one of the bastions of the old city. What lends credence to this is the cannon\u2019s small pivot, unlike what would be needed to mount it on a carriage. Unlike the Qutb Shahi and Mughal cannons with their tapering form, the cannon unearthed on Saturday is a straight piece with serrations all around it, and an elemental design in the front.",
