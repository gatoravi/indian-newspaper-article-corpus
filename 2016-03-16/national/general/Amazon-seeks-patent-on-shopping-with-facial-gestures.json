    "text": "Online retail colossus Amazon is seeking a U.S. patent on using selfies \u2014 instead of passwords \u2014 for shopping when using smartphones.\n\nAmazon reasoned that combining sensor and camera capabilities in smartphones with face and gesture recognising software results in higher security than passwords or identification numbers.\n\n\u201cSuch approaches provide for user authentication without the user having to physically interact with a computing device, which can enable a user to access information by looking at a camera, performing a simple gesture such as a smile, or performing another such action,\u201d Amazon said in a patent application filed late last year. Such an application would be more user-friendly that remembering long passwords, it added. \u2014 AFP",
