But experiments at the time produced only a minuscule amount of current in a simple lab setup.\n\nIncreased efficiency\n\nNow, researchers have increased the efficiency of the process and produced devices that can put out power comparable to what can be produced by today\u2019s best batteries. They caution, however, that it could take several years to develop the concept into a commercialisable product. Much of researchers\u2019 work has focused on not just improving the efficiency of the process but also \u201cdeveloping the theory of how these things work.\u201d\n\nThe latest experiment shows how good agreement between theory and experimental results, providing strong confirmation of the underlying mechanism, said Michael Strano from MIT.\n\nThe effect arises as a pulse of heat pushes electrons through the bundle of carbon nanotubes, carrying the electrons with it like a bunch of surfers riding a wave, researchers said.\n\nKey finding\n\nOne key finding that helped to verify the theory is that sometimes the wave of heat produces a single voltage, but sometimes it produces two different voltage regions at the same time, they said.\n\n\u201cOur mathematical model can describe why that occurs,\u201d said Strano, whereas alternative theories cannot account for this.\n\nAccording to researchers\u2019 theory, the thermopower wave \u201cdivides into two different components,\u201d which sometimes reinforce one another and sometimes counter each other.\n\nThe improvements in efficiency \u201cbrings [the technology] from a laboratory curiosity to being within striking distance of other portable energy technologies,\u201d such as lithium-ion batteries or fuel cells, researchers said. \u2014 PTI",
