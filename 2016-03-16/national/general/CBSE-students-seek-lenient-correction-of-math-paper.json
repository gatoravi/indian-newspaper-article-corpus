An official statement from Change.org said they had demanded that the Board be lenient in the correction of the exam papers.\n\nAmong the petitions, one from Guwahati urged the Board to award grace marks to students; this petition had over 5,000 signatures on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cEven though we were prepared for a challenging paper, this was unexpectedly tough. Most of us are trying to put this behind us and prepare for our accountancy papers on March 17,\u201d said L. Aditya, a student from Chennai.\n\nA petition from Utraksh, a student, to Union Minister Smriti Irani, has further urged the CBSE to take cognisance of the NCERT textbooks while setting question papers.\n\nAnother petition started by a student who signed off as a \u2018disappointed student\u2019 reads: \u201cI agree all you wanted to do was increase the standard of the paper... But all of that by keeping us at stake? These marks are not just going be buried away. They are going to stay with us for a good lot of time...\u201d\n\nManila Carvalho, principal, DPS Bangalore East, said some of the questions were beyond the comprehension of the students. Every mark would make a difference to a child in securing a seat in a professional course.\n\nA class 12 student from National Public School, Bengaluru, who is looking for an admission in IIT, said his aim was to score a centum in mathematics. \u201cBut I was unable to attempt two questions.\u201d\n\n(With inputs from Tanu Kulkarni in Bengaluru.)",
