    "text": "Pointing out that the RSS and the Jana Sangh were able to wriggle out of their political isolation following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, thanks to the Emergency, historian K.N. Panikkar said the RSS was now hard at work to replace the liberal and secular nationalism that emerged through the anti-colonial struggle with an aggressive Hindu fundamentalist nationalism.\n\nDelivering the eighth G. Rajesh Kumar Memorial Lecture here on Monday, Prof. Panikkar said that apart from being a modern phenomenon, nationalism was also a modernising phenomenon.\n\nIts ideological legacy was liberalism, rooted in the enlightenment values of humanism, rationalism and universalism.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in India today is a deliberate attempt to transform the character of Indian nation and nationalism from democratic-secular-liberal to religious-fundamentalist. Those who oppose the attempts to transform the character of the Indian nation and nationalism are being branded anti-nationalists and charged with sedition. The success or failure of this communal agenda would largely depend upon the resistance from civil society. How civil society would respond to this challenge is a matter of great consequence for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Panikkar said there were enough indications that India was moving towards authoritarianism. The emerging fascist tendencies such as authoritarianism, religious hatred, violence and presentism were unmistakable signs of fascism, he said.",
