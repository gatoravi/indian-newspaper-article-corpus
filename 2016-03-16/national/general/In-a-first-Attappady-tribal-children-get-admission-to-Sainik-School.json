The children selected to the school are Binuraj of Karara U.P. School, B. Hari and R. Vishnu of Kottathara U.P. School, M. Midhin, B. Shivakumar and R. Aneesh of Puthur U.P. School.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would crack a national-level competitive examination and subsequent interview. It looks like a miracle,\u2019\u2019 said Hari.\n\nHari and others were part of a group of 24 tribal students from Attappady who appeared for the examination this year under the guidance of the 1991 batch students of the Sainik School.\n\nBuoyed by the success, the alumni association is planning to train at least 100 tribal children from the region for the examination next year.\n\nThe students underwent a six-month training session under the initiative Project Shine. Former student Babu Mathew led the initiative. \u201cOur alumni association undertook the task in its silver jubilee year and it was dedicated to the memory of a batchmate, Shine P. Baby, a lecturer at Rajagiri College, Kalamassery, who passed away in 2006,\u201d says Mr. Mathew.\n\nAlumni bear expenses\n\nThe classes were held on Saturdays.
