    "text": "Since Manipur is geographically close to poll-bound Assam, the leader said, Ms. Gandhi did not want \u201canother stamp of rebellion\u201d on the party. \u201cIt [intra-party rift] affects the morale of the leadership in the neighbouring States,\u201d he said.\n\nThree days ago, 25 Congress leaders, who have gridlocked with Mr. Singh over a Cabinet reshuffle and a change in the PCC leadership, met Ms. Gandhi at 10 Janpath. They brought to her notice Mr. Gaikhangam\u2019s signed memorandum which demanded unification of the \u201cNaga areas of Manipur\u201d with Nagaland. Since the need for signing the memorandum could not be explained to the voters, they told Ms. Gandhi, the Congress suffered a defeat in the November by-elections in two constituencies.\n\nThe dissident leaders also told Ms. Gandhi that the Ministers who lacked transparency and whose performances were unsatisfactory should be replaced. They also reminded her of the assurance of Mr. Singh at the time of forming the Congress Ministry for the third consecutive term in 2013 that in two-and-a-half years there would be a major Cabinet reshuffle and other leaders would be given a chance to prove their administrative skills.\n\nThe dissidents have knocked on the doors of Ms. Gandhi in the past as well. However, they seem relentless this time as they have hinted at crossing over to the BJP if their demands are not met.",
