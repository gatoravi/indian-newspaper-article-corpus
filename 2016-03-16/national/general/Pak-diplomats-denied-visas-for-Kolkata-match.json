    "text": "India on Tuesday denied travel permission to five Delhi-based Pakistan diplomats who wanted to visit Kolkata for Saturday\u2019s Twenty20 cricket match, officials have confirmed.\n\n\u201cWe have denied travel permission to five Delhi-based Pakistani diplomats. We have allowed two Pakistani diplomats based in Delhi to travel, but the other five were denied as they did not apply in the prescribed proforma, giving the flight details\u201d, said a government source, indicating that the five were attached with the ISI and the Pakistan military and, therefore, were usually not allowed to travel outside Delhi.\n\nIndian government sources said that the denial of permission to a few was done as per the usual practice as the entire list of visa requests was usually not accepted. India has, however, promised that Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and his family would be issued visas for whichever match they wished to attend during the ICC World Cup series.\n\nHowever, Pakistan diplomats have termed the episode of visa denial as \u201cunfortunate\u201d which would hurt the necessary supportive role of the officials from the Pakistan High Commission for the match.\n\nIndia has, however, issued visas for 100 Pakistan spectators for Saturday\u2019s match which has been at the centre of a diplomatic tug-of-war for the past few weeks.\n\nPakistan diplomats have termed\n\nthe episode of\n\nvisa denial as \u201cunfortunate\u201d",
