    "text": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu spoke in favour of a probe into a sting operation in which leaders and MPs of the Trinamool Congress were seen accepting money from a fictitious private company in lieu of favours.\n\n\u201cThe prestige of Parliament is at stake. We have to establish the truth. Simply saying it is a conspiracy is not enough and will not satisfy the public,\u201d Mr. Naidu said. Either the government can carry out an inquiry or the Speaker can order one, he said.\n\nCPI(M) MP Mohammad Salim raised the issue during Zero Hour and was followed by BJP\u2019s S.S. Ahluwalia and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury of the Congress who slammed the Trinamool. \u201cIt is an embarrassment for our democratic system. The matter must be referred to the ethics committee,\u201d Mr. Ahluwalia said.\n\nSaugata Roy of the Trinamool, who was seen in the video, wondered under what rule the Speaker allowed members to raise the issue. \u201cI had to live to see this day. It [sting] is part of conspiracy before the West Bengal polls where the CPI (M), the Congress and the BJP are destined to lose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prestige of Parliament is at stake. Truth must be established, the Minister says",
