    "text": "The VIP security cover for some of city\u2019s richest citizens is taking its toll on the government machinery and exchequer. According to latest data, nearly 62 VVIPs owe Rs. 5 crore as dues to the Maharashtra Home Department and despite reminders by district collectors in South and North Mumbai, have refused to pay up.\n\nThe list includes leading industrialists, politicians, actors, producers and directors, and is drawn up at the end of 2015. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in his written reply to the Lower House on Tuesday refused to give reasons for the delay but assured that necessary follow up was being carried out to recover the dues.\n\nThe Z, Z+, Y and X, category security covers are provided by a Chief Minister-led Security Review Committee depending on the threat perception assessed by intelligence agencies. While a person under Y-Category gets 11 police personnel along with one personal security officer and an armed guard, the Z category includes an additional escort jeep, while Z+ is considered equivalent to an SPG cover involving over 30 personnel with advanced weaponry.",
