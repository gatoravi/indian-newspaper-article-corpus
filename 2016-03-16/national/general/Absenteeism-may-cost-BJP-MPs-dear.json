Moorthy\n\nThe BJP Members of Parliament who are members of Standing Committees of Parliament and have below 50 per cent attendance in the meetings of these committees may be replaced.\n\nAt a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party here on Tuesday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu told the members as much, saying that it was necessary for those appointed to key Standing Committees to be regular in their work.\n\nMeanwhile, sources said that some changes had been sought by the party to the key committees of Estimates, Public Accounts and Public Undertakings, something which made many wonder whether this was related to Mr. Naidu\u2019s words of caution.\n\n12 members removed\n\nIt is believed that the party has decided to replace Vinod Khanna, Kirti Azad and four others from the Estimates Committee, S.S. Ahluwalia, Dushyant Singh and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank from the Public Accounts Committee and Varun Gandhi, apart from two others, from the Committee on Public Undertakings. In all, 12 replacements are believed to be in place.\n\n\u201cI have not filed my nomination. I did not do so in 2014 too, when the party nominated me. There is no question of replacement when I did not file my nomination. It is the party\u2019s choice whom to nominate,\u201d Mr. Ahluwalia told The Hindu .\n\nIn the meeting, Mr. Naidu is believed to have commended the work done by BJP MP Anil Madhav Dave in the committees. Mr. Dave has been on the Public Accounts Committee and has headed three Select Committees since 2015, including the one on the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, which has been passed by both Houses of Parliament.\n\nMr. Naidu also spoke on the controversy over the suicide of Dalit student Rohith Vemula and the booking of JNU students on charges of sedition, saying the Congress had scored a \u201cself-goal\u201d by opposing the government on the issue.\n\nHe said there were 11 cases of suicide at Hyderabad University prior to Vemula\u2019s case and that six of these were Dalit students. Yet, the Congress did not react and Rahul Gandhi did not visit the campus earlier, he added.\n\nHe is believed to have told the BJP MPs that a factual counter-offensive worked in such cases and the members should also take the message to the people.",
