Vohra\u2019s unprecedented reforms in his two-month rule seems to have unnerved coalition partners Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and BJP, putting extra pressure on the combine to form a government as key public issues offering huge political capital stand settled by the Governor.\n\nIn a landmark decision, Mr. Vohra on Monday revised the foodgrain allotment under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) following growing street protests. Subsequently, the State Administration Council (SAC), appointed by Mr. Vohra, increased the allotment per person to 7 kg from 5 kg for Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Priority Sector House Holds.\n\nFast-paced reforms\n\nThe Governor\u2019s rule has witnessed other swift measures and reforms across the board. The SAC has addressed long-pending cases on retirement benefits for employees, cleared the Free Drugs Policy, created vacancy for 100 doctors by terminating services, passed the much-delayed new media advertisement policy, approved the Industrial Policy-2016, begun massive dredging on the Jhelum river and passed amendments to the J&K Medical Education (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1979 to conform to the Medical Council of India (MCI) norms.\n\nBesides, Mr. Vohra\u2019s tenure has seen a major reshuffle in the bureaucracy and the police. The Governor has also been tough on political appointments, asking all political appointees such as the Advocate General to resign. Similarly, both PDP and BJP Ministers were served notice to vacate their ministerial bungalows.\n\nThe most far-reaching decision has been disbursement of flood relief of around Rs. 500 crore, apart from implementation of the Prime Minister\u2019s Rs. 80,000 crore package.",
