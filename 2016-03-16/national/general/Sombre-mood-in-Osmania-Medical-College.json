    "text": "A sombre mood prevailed on the Osmania Medical College (OMC) on Tuesday morning as the news of the death of a few students in an accident near Vijayawada spread within the campus.\n\nShocked students began talking about the accident and recalled their association with some of the students.\n\n\u201cLaxman and Vijay Teja would have bagged jobs next month. They would have finished their house surgeon course in two weeks.\n\nFate has been very cruel to them and their families,\u201d Kalyan, a student leader said.\n\nThe college management declared a two-day holiday on Tuesday and Wednesday to mourn the death of the students. The college corridors wore a deserted look as was the canteen that usually bustles with students and the noise of plates and pans.\n\nAround afternoon, the students who stayed back organised a candle light prayer. While most of the male students left for Vijaywada to help the injured students and donate blood, the girl students attended the candle light prayer and observed a two-minute silence.\n\nAs students trooped in front of the photographs of the four boys with their smiling faces, they broke down. All through, there was a feeling of distrust about the role of college authorities in the accident.\n\n\u201cHad the authorities taken personal interest, the incident would have been avoided,\u201d many of the students said.\n\nThroughout the day, media OB vans and reporters stayed put in the college. Leaders of various medical associations also came and met college officials and students.",
