    "text": "Palaeontologists have found the presence of a gender-specific reproductive tissue in a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T. Rex) that roamed Montana in the U.S. 68 million years ago, thereby allowing them to determine the gender of this fossil.\n\nThe T. Rex femur may be the key to discerning gender differences among theropod, or meat-eating dinosaur species. The findings shed light on the evolution of egg-laying in modern birds. The femur was a medullary bone found only in female birds. \u2014 IANS",
