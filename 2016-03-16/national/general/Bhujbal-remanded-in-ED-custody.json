He said statements of bank accounts of various entities were collected from the banks concerned and analysed.\n\nSeeking Mr. Bhujbal\u2019s custody for three days, he said that it had also been revealed that certain individuals/entities had provided payments through cheques against cash to the Bhujbal companies in the guise of dubious real estate deals.\n\nMr. Venegavkar also informed the court that Mr. Bhujbal had not cooperated and not answered questions related to contractors, relationship between the contractor and the sub-contractor, why meetings were held and contracts were given to certain contractors.\n\nHe said a former employee of the Mumbai Education Turst, Amit Balraj, had disclosed that he was witness to huge leather bags containing Rs. 1 crore of the Rs. 1000 currencies being brought to the MET office.\n\nOpposing the agency\u2019s application seeking Mr. Bhujbal\u2019s custody, senior counsel P.K. Dhakephalkar said Mr. Bhujbal had fully cooperated with the ED and that he was willing to be at their office from morning to evening to answer questions. He said since there were allegations of kickbacks in the construction of the Maharashtra Sadan, it should be a case of Prevention of Corruption Act, not Prevention of Money Laundering Act.",
