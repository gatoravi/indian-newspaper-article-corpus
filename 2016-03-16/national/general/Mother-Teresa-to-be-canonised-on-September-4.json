He later joked that she had seemed so formidable he \u201cwould have been scared if she had been my mother superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe built an empire of charity,\u201d said the Rev. Bernardo Cervellera, editor of the Vatican-affiliated missionary news agency AsiaNews. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a plan to conquer the world. Her idea was to be obedient to God.\u201d \u2014 AFP/AP",
