This means that the particles are capable of being produced in colliders, researchers said.\n\nThis theory\u2019s dark particles are called weakly-interacting massive particles, and are thought to have been created in an inconceivably large number shortly after the birth of the universe 13.7 billion years ago.\n\nResearchers call their version of such a heavy particle a PIDM particle (Planckian Interacting Dark Matter). In their new model, they calculated how the required number of PIDM particles could have been created in the early universe.\n\n\u201cIt was possible, if it was extremely hot. To be more precise the temperatures in the early universe must have been the highest possible in the Big Bang theory,\u201d said Sloth.\n\n\u201cIf the universe indeed was as hot as calculated in our model, several gravitational waves from the childhood of universe would have been created. We might be able to find out in the near future,\u201d he said. The study was published in the journal Physical Review Letters . \u2014 PTI",
