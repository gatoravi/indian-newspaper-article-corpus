    "text": "Two weeks before pictorial warnings covering 85 per cent of the principal display area of the front and back sides of all tobacco products can become effective, a Parliamentary Committee on Subordinate Legislation report on Tuesday said that the requirement will be \u201ctoo harsh\u201d on the tobacco industry and will result in \u201cflooding of illicit cigarettes\u201d and affect the livelihood of thousands of tobacco farmers and workers.\n\nThe committee has recommended that pictorial warnings be restricted to only 50 per cent on both the sides of the cigarette packets.\n\nIn the case of beedis, chewing tobacco and other tobacco products, the committee recommended that the warning be restricted 50 per cent of the display area and on only one side of the packet.\n\nIn the case of beedis, it said that there would be \u201cvirtually no space left for printing the brand name and logo\u201d if 85 per cent of area is earmarked for printing the warning on both sides. The committee has not stated the logic for restricting the warning to only one side in the case of chewing tobacco products.\n\n\u201cBeing a Committee on Subordinate Legislation, its mandate is only to look at whether the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Amendment Rules, 2014 are in confirmation with legislation under which they are made,\u201d said Amit Yadav, Director of Public Health Law and Advocacy at the Delhi-based Hriday.\n\n\u201cThey are supposed to look if legislation violates the constitutional principle and are not supposed to frame the regulation or legislation.\u201d",
