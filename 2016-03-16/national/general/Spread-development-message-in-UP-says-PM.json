    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah met the party\u2019s Members of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh at a dinner meeting on Monday night, and asked them to stay abreast of the Modi government\u2019s development initiatives to successfully take its message to the people.\n\nUttar Pradesh, which has 403 Assembly constituencies, goes to the polls next year and is crucial State for the BJP\u2019s overall electoral prospects. The BJP has slated six rallies to be addressed by Mr. Shah and Home Minister Rajnath Singh in the State in April, with Mr. Modi also scheduled to address a rally at Kanpur. Sources said Mr. Modi asked the MPs whether they knew how many villages had been energised under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Jyoti Yojana that aims at the electrification of all villages by March 31, 2017.\n\nHe also asked them how many had downloaded the Grameen Vidyutikaran Android app, which gives users real-time information on the scheme.\n\nThe Prime Minister cautioned that without the MPs themselves aware of the work done by the Centre, the party would lose the opportunity to connect with the people, one of the MPs said.\n\nMr. Shah is believed to have discussed the Modi government\u2019s move to set aside Rs. 8,000 crore to give free cooking gas connections to poor households.",
