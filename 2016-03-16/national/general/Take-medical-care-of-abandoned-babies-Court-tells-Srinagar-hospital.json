    "text": "The High Court on Tuesday took cognizance in the case of two babies abandoned by parents for suffering from medical deformities here and later admitted to the G.B. Pant hospital.\n\nTaking suo motu cognizance on the basis of media reports, Justice Muzaffar Hussain Attar directed the hospital authorities to take \u201cmedical care of the babies\u201d and \u201cnot to hand them over to any unregistered organisations\u201d.\n\nBoth the cases were reported in the last one month. While one baby, suffering from Down\u2019s syndrome, was left outside the hospital itself, another month-old-baby boy was abandoned at a shrine in the old city.\n\n\u201cThe authorities were finding it difficult to keep the babies in the hospital for long. We are providing necessary healthcare, but we can\u2019t keep them here forever,\u201d said Medical Superintendent Dr. Shafaqat Khan.\n\nAfter media reports caught the attention of the general public, a number of individuals and groups have approached the hospital authorities seeking adoption of the infants.",
