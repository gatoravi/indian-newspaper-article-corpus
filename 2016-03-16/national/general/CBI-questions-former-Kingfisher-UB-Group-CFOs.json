    "text": "ED had already examined them in connection with money laundering charge\n\nThe CBI on Tuesday questioned former Chief Financial Officers of the grounded Kingfisher Airlines and the UB Group in the case of the alleged Rs. 900-crore loan default by the company to IDBI.\n\nFormer Kingfisher Airlines CFO A. Raghunathan is an accused along with businessman Vijay Mallya in the case registered by the CBI. The bank had, following his letters citing Mr. Mallya\u2019s meetings with top bank officials, sanctioned short-term loans of Rs.150 crore and Rs. 200 crore to the airline in October-November 2009. The CBI had earlier questioned him.\n\nApart from Mr. Raghunathan, former UB Group CFO Ravi Nedungadi was quizzed by the CBI on Tuesday.\n\nThe development comes days after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned and examined Mr. Nedungadi, Mr. Raghunathan, former IDBI chairman-cum-managing director Yogesh Agarwal and others in connection with the allegations of money laundering.\n\nWhile the CBI had suo motu registered the case in the matter of the IDBI, the agency earlier said the 17 other banks to which Kingfisher Airlines owed over Rs. 9,000 crore had not filed any complaint seeking criminal action and therefore, no case could be registered in those matters.\n\nHowever, the CBI now plans to include all the alleged wilful default matters pertaining to Kingfisher Airlines. The agency is also preparing to approach the court to get letters of judicial requests issued to foreign jurisdictions to gather information on the overseas assets of Mr. Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines.",
