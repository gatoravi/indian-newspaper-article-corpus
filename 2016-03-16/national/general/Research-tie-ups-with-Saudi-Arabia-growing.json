This has skyrocketed to 1,303 in 2013-2014, making the oil rich kingdom India\u2019s 12th most important contributor, surpassing Switzerland, Russia, The Netherlands and Poland. In other words, from having merely 0.1 per cent of India\u2019s total collaborative research publication output in 2005, Saudi Arabia contributes now 1.25 per cent \u2014 a 10-fold increase. In comparison, the U.S. has only increased from 6.67 per cent to 7.47 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis was a voluminous report that looked at various aspects of India\u2019s research publication trends\u2026.we will look at the Saudi Arabia aspect more closely shortly. It\u2019s an interesting find,\u201d said Praveen Arora, a DST official involved with commissioning the study.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s engagement with India is a point highlighted by the authors of the DST report, which has been prepared by Thomson Reuters\u2019 Research and Data Services unit. \u201cCollaboration with Saudi Arabian universities increased dramatically\u2026 Many Saudi Arabian institutions now rank among India\u2019s top 10 collaborating organisations.\u201d\n\nFor their analysis, the report employs a tool called \u2018Web of Science\u2019, a popular, online search tool, used often by scientists to search for research related to their sub-fields. The most prolific Saudi Arabian university mentioned in the analysis is the King Saud University, which is now among the top collaborators with Indian institutions.\n\nWhile the Indian institutions, who\u2019ve been involved with Saudi Arabia, are wide ranging such as the IITs, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Delhi University, there\u2019s been a significant increase in collaborations involving researchers at the Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia and many Saudi Arabian universities.",
