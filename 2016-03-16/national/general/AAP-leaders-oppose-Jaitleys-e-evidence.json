    "text": "The Aam Aadmi Party leaders, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Tuesday took exception to the electronic evidence filed by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in a civil defamation suit filed against them in Delhi High Court.\n\nThe six AAP leaders objected to the admissibility of print-outs of evidence, which Mr Jaitley has filed before the High Court's Joint Registrar allegedly without furnishing a certificate required under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act. They also said that the plaintiff had not filed an affidavit supporting his evidence.\n\nMr. Jaitley's counsel Pratibha M. Singh said this was a delaying tactic by the defendants and the court could go ahead with the proceedings as the Minister had furnished an affidavit. Any objection regarding documents could be raised before the court at the stage of admission and denial, she said.\n\nThe Joint Registrar fixed the issue for March 29 for hearing arguments of both the parties.",
