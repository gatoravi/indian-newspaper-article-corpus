We were clear that the new rules would apply to migrants who entered Tier-2 from April 6, 2011. Those individuals were aware when they entered that new settlement rules would apply to them,\u201d a Home Office statement said.\n\nIndian professionals have formed the largest category of individuals issued such visas over the years. \u2014 PTI",
