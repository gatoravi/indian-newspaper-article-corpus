    "text": "Excerpts of what Kanhaiya Kumar said during the video recording by team of Supreme Court lawyers:\n\n\u201cThe police got me here. First of all I was brought from the gate this way. I don\u2019t know the gate number. The media people surrounded me near the gate. No sooner did the police escort me out of the media, and inside the gate, a mob, dressed in advocate attire attacked me. As a result I fell down.\n\n\u201cIt seemed as if they were waiting with full preparation to attack since from amongst the people who were beating me, some were calling out others by shouting, aa gaya, aa gaya .\n\n\u201cI was pushed inside it (X-ray machine) in such a manner that my pants came down. My leg was injured and I was kicked and punched in my abdomen. As soon as I managed to rescue myself from the clutches of one person, another person would start beating me up. The policemen with me also got beaten up. A policeman has been attacked with a blade. \u201cAfter that I managed to get inside the gate. Thereafter one of them chased me and managed to get inside the adjoining room and went and sat behind. I told my teacher that his man was beating me. The police enquires about the identity of that person. However, he replies who are they and asks for their I-card. He managed his exit right in front of them [police]. He could have been nabbed right there.\n\n\u201cI don't know they are lawyers or not but what they are saying, I think they are highly politically motivated persons. By portraying me as a traitor, media is conducting my trial, not the entire media though... I have full faith in my Indian constitution.\n\n\u201cI told the Judge that Sir, please note that I am terrorised and I am in a state of fear.\u201d",
