Venkaiah Naidu had taken serious objections to the manner in which some political parties are supporting the people who are supporting anti-national elements.\n\nIn an indirect reference to the developments in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) over the past few days, he wondered how these parties are supporting the \u201canti-nationals\u201d who were eulogising people like Afzal Guru, who attacked the Parliament. The manner in which slogans were raised in praise of Afzal Guru and the assertions on completing his unfulfilled task should be opposed, he said.\n\n\u201cThey speak about the unfulfilled aspiration of Afzal Guru. What does that mean, attacking the Parliament, killing the MPs and bringing down democracy?\u201d he asked appealing to leaders of political parties not to support such elements.",
