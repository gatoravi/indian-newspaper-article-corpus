I feel like I\u2019m back in the early days of the battle for HIV treatment, where you live or die based on where you live\u201d, he said.\n\nOn January 14, 2014, India\u2019s Deputy Controller General of Patents had rejected the company\u2019s patent claim, allowing generic drug makers to manufacture affordable versions of the drug.\n\nThe verdict was set aside by the Delhi High Court on January 30.\n\nIt is estimated that 150 million people are infected by hepatitis C globally, and 700,000 die of the disease each year. Untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer.",
