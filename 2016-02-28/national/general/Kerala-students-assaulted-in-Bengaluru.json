At 1.30 a.m., a group of four to five men armed with lathis barged into the house and began raining blows on Mervin. When Kameshwar and Mashood tried to intervene, they too were attacked.\n\nEarlier skirmish with locals\n\nMervin told the police that the local people in and around Shani Mahatma temple in Bhoopasandra had objected to the noise their motorcycles made. On Friday night, a few locals deflated the tyres of two motorcycles that belonged to the boys. This led to a heated argument between Mervin and the locals.\n\nThis could be the reason behind the attack, T.R. Suresh Deputy Commissioner of Police (north) said adding that efforts were on to nab the attackers.\n\nPolice refused to take up a complaint and asked them to resolve the issue with the gang",
