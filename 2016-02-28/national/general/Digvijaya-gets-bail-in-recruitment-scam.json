Mr. Singh, along with his lawyers, appeared before the Additional District and Session Judge Kashinath Singh, a day after the court issued a non-bailable warrant against him for not turning up before it.Mr. Singh furnished a bond of Rs. 30,000.\n\nA 169-page supplementary charge sheet was filed on Friday in the case which pertains to alleged irregularities in recruitment in the State Assembly Secretariat.\n\nMr. Singh has been charged with forgery, cheating, conspiracy and misuse of office as well as offences under Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\n\u201cThe case is \u2018politically motivated\u2019 and is a fallout of the Vyapam scam [alleged recruitment scam in government jobs and also in admission to medical and dental colleges]. Even the probe committee had not found anything against him,\u201d said Mr. Singh\u2019s lawyer Vivek Tankha.\n\nAs the prosecution did not raise any objection to Mr. Tankha\u2019s submission, the court granted bail to Mr. Singh. \u2014 PTI",
