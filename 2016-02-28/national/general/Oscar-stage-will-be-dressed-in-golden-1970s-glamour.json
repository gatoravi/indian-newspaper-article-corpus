So many exciting movies were made then. And that sense of high glamour from that period really feels like a certain type of Hollywood that is sexy and glamorous and meets the fantasy of people who dream about what Hollywood is.\u201d\n\nThe gold lame look also goes with the Oscars\u2019 theme this year, \u201cWe all dream in gold.\u201d\n\nMcLane said he was still waiting for a few more stage elements to be delivered and will be tweaking things until Saturday night\u2019s dress rehearsal. The 88th Academy Awards (and Mr. McLane\u2019s fourth as production designer) will be broadcast Sunday on ABC. \u2014 AP",
