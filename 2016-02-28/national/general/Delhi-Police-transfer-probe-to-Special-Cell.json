    "text": "The probe into the sedition charges against some JNU students was transferred to the anti-terror Special Cell on Saturday. \u201cI have directed my officers to transfer the case to the Special Cell as the matter needs focused investigation. In a case registered under Section 124-A (sedition), the Special Cell shall do justice.\u201d\n\nThe process of transfer is expected to take two days, he said, adding that the local district police would not be able focus on the case they way it demands as it has to deal with numerous routine law and order affairs.\n\nA few days after registering the case in connection with the February 9 event at the JNU campus, Prem Nath, DCP (South), had written to Commissioner of Police B.S. Bassi, requesting him to transfer the case to the Special Cell. Mr. Bassi had refused initially, saying the concerned police district had enough capacity to deal with the matter.\n\nThe transfer could mean an extended stay in jail for Kanhaiya Kumar and the other two arrested students Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya \u2014 if the duo is sent to jail at the end of their police custody. The Special Cell will begin a fresh probe into the matter.\n\nWhile the Special Cell will get all the documents, including the interrogation reports of the three arrested students, they may seek the suspects\u2019 police custody again.",
