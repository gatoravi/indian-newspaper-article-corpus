The Opposition parties are taking his mother\u2019s line, endorsed by Scheduled Caste Commission Chairman P.L. Punia: She, as a Dalit, brought up her son, who was a Scheduled Caste as per law and had a certificate.\n\nBSP chief Mayawati had also attacked HRD Minister Smriti Irani in Parliament, saying the judicial inquiry into the suicide was not under a Dalit judge. The Office of RG, the Twitter handle of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, tweeted on Saturday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should hear the words of Vemula\u2019s mother.\n\nThe Left parties will move privilege motions against Ms. Irani, for her statements on the suicide and for her reading out a pamphlet, allegedly put out by some students of JNU celebrating Mahishasura and using remarks derogatory to Goddess Durga. \u201cWe want to know what was the pamphlet she read out, what is its authenticity and why she read it out. Will a Minister read out any material circulating anywhere outside?\u201d CPI leader D. Raja told The Hindu .",
