Section 123-A (acts damaging the sovereignty of the country) carries the maximum punishment of 10 years in jail or fine or both.\n\nMr. Daraz said he had no idea that he had committed a crime, urging the authorities concerned to pardon him as he should be seen as \u201can Indian cricketer\u2019s fan and not a spy\u201d. \u2014 PTI",
