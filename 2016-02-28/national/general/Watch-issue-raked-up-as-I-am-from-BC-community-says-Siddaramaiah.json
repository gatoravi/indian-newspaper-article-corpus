Kumaraswamy over the luxury watch got a backward classes twist on Saturday.\n\nWhile Mr. Siddaramaiah accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of gunning for him because he was \u201cjealous\u201d of a backward classes\u2019 leader becoming Chief Minister, the latter attacked the former for \u201cusing the backward classes tag\u201d to protect himself from the issue, which has reached the party high command.\n\n\u2018Wild allegations\u2019\n\nA day after Mr. Kumaraswamy accused the Chief Minister of wearing a \u201cstolen\u201d watch, an enraged Mr. Siddaramaiah retaliated on Saturday by stating that Mr. Kumaraswamy was making wild allegations out of frustration as \u201che could not digest a backward classes\u2019 leader occupying the top post.\u201d\n\nCiting instances from the political history of Karnataka on how backward classes\u2019 leaders were hounded out of power, Mr. Siddaramaiah said S. Bangarappa, senior Congress leader, who was a backward classes\u2019 leader, was removed from the post of Chief Minister in 1992. Similar was the fate of M. Veerappa Moily, another OBC leader.\n\n\u201cNow, a similar attempt is being made, as Mr. Kumaraswamy and others could not tolerate a leader from the backward classes leading the State,\u201d Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged.\n\nResponding to this, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that the Janata Dal (Secular) had no hand in either unseating Mr. Bangarappa or Mr. Moily. It was the Congress, which was instrumental in removing both, he said. \u201cIn fact, it was the JD(S) which promoted backward classes\u2019 leaders and Mr. Siddaramaiah could become the Chief Minister because he was groomed by the Janata Dal,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Siddaramaiah, who has forgotten his socialist roots after joining the Congress, is now using the backward classes tag to protect himself,\u201d he said.",
