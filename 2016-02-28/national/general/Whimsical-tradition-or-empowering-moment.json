    "text": "Some women say the belief that they can propose only on a Leap Day is outdated\n\nLeap Day will soon be here, and jokes surrounding it have been doing the rounds on social media over the last week. There\u2019s one that reads \u2018Leap Year gives me extra time to reflect on how unproductive I am with extra time\u2019. And then there\u2019s this \u2014 \u2018If Christmas was today, I would only have to see my family every four years!\u2019\n\nJokes apart, February 29 has a definitive air about it. If you\u2019re tired of waiting for him to get down on one knee to propose marriage with a rock bigger than your head, apparently today is that one day when you can pull off a Margaret Tate from The Proposal . And if you\u2019re worried about him saying \u2018no\u2019, you must know that he cannot get away without paying a fine.\n\nThe tradition, which has its origins in Ireland, was also subscribed to by the Scots. Legend has it that in Denmark, if a man turns down a proposal today, he would have to give the woman 12 pairs of gloves (the gloves are meant to hide the woman\u2019s embarrassment of not having an engagement ring), and in Finland, the penalty is fabric for a skirt!\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind proposing to my boyfriend on Leap Day, but then again, I don\u2019t want to celebrate my engagement anniversary only every four years. And perhaps for that very reason, if I proposed, my boyfriend would happily say \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d quips Ariana Gonsalves, a lifestyle blogger.\n\nHowever, Shipra Rajeev-Kumar, a social activist, thinks: \u201cThis is easily the most anti-feminist practice. We live in a time and age where we are advocating gender parity, so a woman should be allowed to propose or do anything else she wants to (and that society perceives is only a man\u2019s thing to do) whenever she wants to. We don\u2019t need an extra day every four years to take a leap of any sort.\u201d\n\nApart from bizarre customs such as this, does the leap year make much of a difference to anyone?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just another day added to the year, and unfortunately this time, I will be getting my salary one day later than usual. So, that\u2019s the only bummer,\u201d laughs Nitish Desai, a copy editor. He adds: \u201cBut I have friends who wouldn\u2019t start anything auspicious on February 29. Even in Greece, people don\u2019t get married on Leap Day, as it\u2019s considered unlucky!\u201d\n\nFor leaplings (those who are born on February 29), celebrating an official birthday, there is some amount of excitement. \u201cI\u2019m turning five this year, and unlike other five-year-olds, no colouring books for me! My parents are gifting me my dream bike and my friends and I are going to party at a farmhouse. I love that I get to do something extra special every four years,\u201d says Aymaan Khan, a college student.",
