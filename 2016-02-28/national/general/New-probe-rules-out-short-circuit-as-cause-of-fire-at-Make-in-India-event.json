    "text": "A day after an FIR was booked against Wizcraft for the fire at the Maharashtra Night event at Chowpatty on February 14, an independent agency that probes major fires has ruled out short circuit as a possible cause of the fire and has held pyrotechnics responsible for the blaze that gutted the stage where a live dance performance was being held when the fire broke out.\n\nThe Mumbai Fire Brigade\u2019s fact-finding report on the fire during the Maharashtra Night cultural event has cited short circuit in the electric wiring under the stage as the reason. A detailed analysis of the incident by a U.S.-based certification firm Underwriters\u2019 Laboratory (UL) has now raised0 question marks over the original report, concluding that the incident could have been a result of the flames of the pyrotechnic fireworks on the stage.\n\nA detailed analysis by the certification and analytical firm has concluded that short circuit was not a possibility as \u2018fuse circuits were still live when the fire was engulfing, with music blaring and lights continue to stay on.\u201d The fire brigade had based the short-circuit theory on three phase fuses found blown connected to a meter at the location, but the UL analysis claims if the three fuses had blown up, the \u2018electric supply should have disconnected immediately\u2019. That did not happen.\n\n\u201cHad the fire brigade even checked if an arching took place near the blown fuse, they would have made a different conclusion,\u201d said P.D. Karguppikar, former chief fire officer and member of UL analysis team.\n\nSays pyrotechnics responsible for blaze that gutted stage during dance performance",
