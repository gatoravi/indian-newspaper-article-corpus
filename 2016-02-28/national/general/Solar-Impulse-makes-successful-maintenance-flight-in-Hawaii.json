    "text": "The sun-powered plane Solar Impulse 2 has made a successful test flight in Hawaii, where it has been grounded for repairs on its round-the-world trek, the Swiss-based project said Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe first Solar Impulse 2 maintenance flight took place on Friday 26 of February (and) was uneventful. The plane took off from Kalaeloa airport at 4:32PM UTC [GMT] with our test pilot, Markus Scherdel, in the cockpit, and landed at 6:05PM UTC,\u201d it said on its blog.\n\nStability check\n\nLasting an hour and a half and reaching an altitude of 8,000 feet, the flight enabled technicians to run checks on the stabilisation and cooling system, \u201cwhich both performed superbly,\u201d the project said.\n\nThe plane completed nearly half of an unprecedented round-the-world journey without using a drop of fuel before battery damage during a gruelling five-day leg from Japan to Hawaii in July forced its grounding.\n\nOn December 20, Solar Impulse spokeswoman Alexandra Gindroz said that, after securing funds to complete the repairs and finance the next phase of operations, the plane would be ready to fly again by April 20.\n\nThe aircraft took off from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 9, powered by 17,000 solar cells, with the aim of promoting renewable energy through a round-the-world flight.\n\nPilots Andre Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard have divided the flying throughout the groundbreaking project. \u2014 AFP",
