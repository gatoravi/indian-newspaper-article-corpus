    "text": "Parliament\u2019s Standing Committee on Defence has expressed dismay over the government\u2019s reluctance to commit to a minimum percentage of its expenses for the armed forces, despite its recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe committee also feel dismayed to note that although the Ministry of Defence has reportedly conveyed the concern expressed by them to the Ministry of Finance on 14 January 2015, the response of the Ministry of Finance is still awaited,\u201d said an action-taken report submitted to Parliament on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe committee desire that this declining ratio should be arrested in the next financial year itself, so that the services are provided adequate funds, and hence they are not deprived of essential equipment and ammunition,\u201d it had said earlier.\n\nThe committee had then told the government that it should \u201cconsider fixing a minimum benchmark for this percentage, which should be adhered to, in every case\u201d.\n\nThe Defence Ministry told the committee that it had written to the Finance Ministry on January 14 last year, drawing its attention to the recommendation of the parliamentary committee. The Ministry did not respond.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance was informed about the committee\u2019s emphasis on the need for increase in defence expenditure in proportion to the total Central government spending and fixing a minimum benchmark percentage in this regard. Response from Ministry of Finance is awaited,\u201d the Defence Ministry told the committee.\n\nThough the defence budget is increasing numerically annually, as a proportion of the Central budget, it has consistently been declining. In 2009-10, the defence expenditure of Rs. 1,41,781 crore was 13.84 per cent of the total expenditure. In 2010-11, the budget increased in absolute terms, but in percentage terms, it came down to 12.87 per cent. In 2011-12, the defence expenditure rose to Rs. 1,70,913 crore, but in percentage terms, it was merely 13.1 per cent of the government\u2019s expenditure. Since then, it has been sliding continuously.\n\nIn 2012-13, the defence expenditure was pegged at Rs. 1,81,776, which was 12.89 per cent of the government\u2019s expenditure. However, it further came down to 12.81 per cent under the revised budget.",
