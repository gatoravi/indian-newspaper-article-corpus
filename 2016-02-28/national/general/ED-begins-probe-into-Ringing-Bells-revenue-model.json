The company has already booked orders for about 7 crore mobile sets.\n\nThe ED has contacted the promoters of Ringing Bells seeking answers to the revenue model adopted by the company.\n\nThe agency will ascertain whether the firm has in any way violated rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act.\n\nSoon after the company announced the offer, the Indian Cellular Association had written to the Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, raising questions on the pricing of the smartphone. Taking cognisance, the Department of Electronics and IT held a meeting with the company representatives, during which the firm explained its business model.",
