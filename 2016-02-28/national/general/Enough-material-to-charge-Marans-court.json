The accused were charge-sheeted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.\n\nThe ED had claimed that there were money transactions allegedly showing that South Asia FM Limited (SAFL) and two firms, SAFL and Sun Direct TV Private Ltd. (SDTPL), had received Rs.742.58 crore as proceeds of crime from Mauritius-based firms in the Aircel-Maxis deal. SAFL was allegedly controlled by co-accused Kalanithi Maran.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation had also charge-sheeted the Maran brothers, two Malaysian nationals and four companies in the case in August 2014.\n\nAll the accused have denied the charges levelled against them by the investigating agencies.",
