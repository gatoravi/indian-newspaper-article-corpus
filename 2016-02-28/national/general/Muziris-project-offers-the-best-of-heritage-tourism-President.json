This is where the Muziris project offers the best of heritage tourism to global travellers,\u201d Mr. Mukherjee he said.\n\nHe noted the fact that various religions in the State share their traditions. \u201cMany churches light oil lamps and raise flags as is done in Hindu temples. Similarly, the Cheraman mosque has an oil lamp which is always lit. I am glad that the Muziris Heritage Project seeks to bring alive this wonderful mosaic of cultural influences in a holistic way.\u201d\n\nThe Muziris project would open up to Indian and foreign tourists a new destination, bringing economic benefits to the people of the region as well as knowledge and enjoyment for the visitors, he said.\n\nThe President also launched the website of the Muziris Heritage Project.\n\nGovernor P. Sathasivam presided over the function. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, V.D. Satheesan and T.N. Prathapan, MLAs, K.V. Thomas MP, Chief Secretary Jiji Thomson, and Kerala Tourism Secretary Kamala Vardhana Rao were present.",
