    "text": "Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has said that his visit to India had helped in \u201cimproving\u201d the ties that had \u201csoured\u201d during the anti-Constitution protests even as the agitating Madhesis called it a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d and warned of a fresh stir if their demands were not met.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the relations between the two neighbours had soured during the Madhesi agitation, but my visit has helped improve the relations between the two countries\u201d, Mr. Oli said, addressing a gathering in Bhairahawa on Friday.\n\nTerming his visit as \u201cfruitful\u201d, Mr. Oli said, \u201cAs we have no misunderstandings now, our focus will be on implementing the seven-point deal\u201d. \u201cAs we have delivered the Constitution, now is the time to focus on development. So, I call on the agitating leaders and Nepali Congress to join the government and participate in the nation-building process\u201d, he said.\n\nMr. Oli, however, said any demand against national interests would not be addressed.\n\nMeanwhile, the agitating United Democratic Madhesi Front (UDMF) on Saturday held a meeting here to review its protest programmes. In a statement after the meeting, the UDMF termed Mr. Oli\u2019s visit to India as a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d and said Prime Minister had made a mistake as he made the visit without any agenda.\n\nThe Madhesis, who had announced withdrawal of their protests, including the border blockade, warned that they would resort to fresh protests if the government did not address their demands promptly. \u2014PTI",
