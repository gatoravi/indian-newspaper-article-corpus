The good rain that the district received in the northwest monsoon had raised hope among the cotton farmers that they would get good harvest. However, field reports had suggested that the cotton production had taken severe hit because of crop failure.\n\nAs against the target of 13,600 hectares of land, hybrid cotton crop had been raised on 9,145 hectares of land, mostly in Ariyalur and Senthurai blocks, in the district. Farmers had started harvesting the crop.\n\nThe harvest was expected to be over in the next one or two weeks as the crop had reached its maturity stage. According to the ground reports received by the Agricultural Department, the yield was down by 40 per cent this season. As against the average yield of 10 to 12 quintal per acre, the current season yield hovers between six and eight quintal.\n\nA senior official of the Agricultural Department told The Hindu that water stagnation on cotton fields during the northwest monsoon had a huge impact on the yield of cotton. The cotton crop would not withstand excess moisture and stress. Moreover, farmers could not take up effective plant protection measures because of continuous rain.\n\nAdmitting that farmers had suffered heavy loss, an official said it was not possible for them to get back the investment on raising cotton crop.\n\nFarmers might have spent not less than Rs. 20,000 an acre for raising cotton crop.",
