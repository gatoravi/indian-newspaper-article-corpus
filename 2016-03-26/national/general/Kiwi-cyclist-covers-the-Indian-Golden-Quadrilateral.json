However, the inner and link roads were challenging. I had a close shave at least three times. Once I was almost mowed down by a truck and I narrowly escaped,\u201d the cyclist said.\n\nCurious questions\n\nMr. Chittock describes the people he met on the way as always affectionate and curious about his journey.\n\n\u201cPeople will always come for a handshake. They would ask me questions like \u2018Where are you from?\u2019, \u2018Where you have to go?\u2019, and \u2018What is the cost of your cycle\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chittock is attempting to set a Guinness World Record for cycling on the Indian Golden Quadrilateral in a limited time. He was contacted by Guinness and asked if would give it a try.\n\nMr. Chittock practices every day cycling about 80 km on average. \u2014 PTI\n\nThe national highways are okay for cycling.
