For the Prime Minister\u2019s events abroad, the BJP coordinates with local community groups who actually host the reception.\n\n\u201cThe event in Brussels is on as of now; we haven\u2019t been told otherwise by the Belgian government,\u201d said Mr. Chauthaiwale.\n\nAccording to sources, of the 12,000 strong Indian community in Belgium, around 5,000 have registered for the event, which will be held at the Brussels Expo.\n\nThe Prime Minister would be attending the India-European Union summit and bilateral talks.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong Gujarati Patel community in Belgium due to the diamond trade, and around 1200 students,\u201d said one of the organisers.",
