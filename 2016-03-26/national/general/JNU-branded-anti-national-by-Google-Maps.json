The results shown by Google\u2019s navigation service uses data from multiple points on the web, including news outlets, to optimise search results. Since, the terms \u2018anti-national\u2019, \u2018Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019, \u2018natio-nalism\u2019, \u2018patriotism\u2019 etc. have recently been used in news reports about JNU, the words have became associated in the Google Maps as well.",
