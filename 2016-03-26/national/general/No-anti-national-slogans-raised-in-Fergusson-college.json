The slogans raised by students during the event were only against alleged \u2018bad governance\u2019 and \u2018persecution of minorities.\u2019 We have studied the footage of the event carefully,\u201d said Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Pune.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Ambedkarite group and the right-wing ABVP verbally clashed at an event addressed by ABVP\u2019s student president in JNU, Alok Singh, forcing the college authorities to call in the police.\n\nPrincipal R.G. Pardeshi thought that the Dalit students had raised anti-national slogans and sent a complaint to the Deccan Gymkhana police.\n\n\u201cI request you to take stern action against individuals who raised anti-national slogans on the campus,\u201d Mr. Pardeshi had said in his letter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Pardeshi withdrew his complaint citing \u201ctypographical errors.\u201d Many Dalit representatives staged protests against the principal.\n\nPolice say they were against \u2018bad governance\u2019 and \u2018persecution of minorities\u2019",
