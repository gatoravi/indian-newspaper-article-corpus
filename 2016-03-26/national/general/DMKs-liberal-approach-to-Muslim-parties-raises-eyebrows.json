Just days ago, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a traditional partner of the DMK, was given an equal number of seats.\n\nHowever, some sections among Muslims feel that the DMK may be underestimating its own base in the community and was unnecessarily providing space for smaller groups.\n\nIn the 2011 Assembly elections, the AIADMK allotted three seats to the MMK of which the party won two. In the DMK front, the IUML was also given three seats, all of which the party lost.\n\nSources in the DMK said the situation was quite different from 2011.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t have too many partners this time. So, we have more seats to give. Even then, we have only given two more than 2011,\u201d said a spokesperson. In the past, Muslims traditionally identified themselves with the DMK, given prominent faces like Sadiq Pasha, who was once the treasurer, Nagoor E.M. Hanifa and former Minister A. Rahman Khan.\n\nDMK president M. Karunanidhi maintained close relationship with IUML stalwart Muhammad Ismail, popularly known as Quaid-e-Milleth.\n\nMuslim historian Kombai S. Anwar says that the community votes with the mainstream parties.\n\nIf you take constituencies with a high Muslim population, you will see that the major Dravidian parties get substantially more votes than these smaller groups.\n\nKombai S. Anwar\n\nMuslim historian\n\nThe Dravidian major has given five seats each to MMK and IUML",
