    "text": "MIT researchers have developed a new voice-controlled app that may help obese people to lose weight by logging calorie counts and other nutritional information after every meal.\n\nThe system parses the description and automatically retrieves the pertinent nutritional data from an online database maintained by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), researchers said.\n\nThe data are displayed together with images of the corresponding foods and pull-down menus that allow the user to refine their descriptions - selecting, for instance, precise quantities of food. But those refinements can also be made verbally, researchers said.\n\nA user who begins by saying, \u201cfor breakfast, I had a bowl of oatmeal, bananas, and a glass of orange juice\u201d can then make the amendment, \u201cI had half a banana,\u201d and the system will update the data it displays about bananas while leaving the rest unchanged, they said.\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) concentrated on two problems.\n\nOne is identifying words\u2019 functional role \u2014 the system needs to recognise that if the user records the phrase \u201cbowl of oatmeal,\u201d nutritional information on oatmeal is pertinent, but if the phrase is \u201coatmeal cookie,\u201d it is not.\n\nThe other problem is reconciling the user\u2019s phrasing with the entries in the USDA database.\n\nThrough the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform, they recruited workers who simply described what they had eaten at recent meals, then labelled the pertinent words in the description as names of foods, quantities, brand names, or modifiers of the food names.\n\nResearchers used machine-learning algorithms to find patterns in the syntactic relationships between words that would identify their functional roles. \u2014 PTI",
