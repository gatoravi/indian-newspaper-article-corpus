I am proud to have held a grand wedding ceremony for Poonam, who is as good as my daughter,\u201d said Vijaybhai, who set up the trust for cow protection.\n\nThe wedding procession of the bovine couple started from the Sola Bhagwat Vidhyapith in Ahmedabad.\n\nThe bride was taken on a palanquin installed on a decorated truck with orchestra.\n\nGujarat is in the grip of cow protection campaigns.
