A pass in the SET is a prerequisite for candidates aspiring to be appointed as assistant professors in colleges and universities. The UGC had assigned the university as a nodal agency for conducting the SET. Acting on a complaint that the university had wrongly included \u201ccreamy layer\u201d OBC candidates in the non-creamy layer category, UGC\u2019s Senior Statistical Officer Ravi Patwardhan has written to it seeking a response. Mr. Patwardhan pointed out that the complainant, R. Srikumar, an assistant professor in a Salem-based college, had also stated that he submitted numerous representations with material records but appropriate action was not taken in this matter.",
