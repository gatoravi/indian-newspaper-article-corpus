How much do you charge for your programmes,\u201d was the question that angered the actor, who is immediately said to have slapped the person who posed it.\n\n\u201cIt is true that she lost her temper when she was asked a question. But the person who asked the question was posing as a reporter. He was not a genuine scribe,\u201d said a journalist from Surat who was present at the hotel.\n\nFollowing the incident, Ms. Leone reportedly called the event organisers and asked them to ensure adequate security at the venue where she was supposed to dance in the event called \u201cHoli with Sunny Leone.\u201d\n\nHowever, as the media reported the news on Friday, Ms. Leone denied slapping the person.\n\nSources said her denial was about not slapping any scribe as that was never the case at all.\n\n\u201cThe person who was slapped was not associated with any media,\u201d a Surat-based journalist told The Hindu .\n\nNo police complaint\n\nNo police complaint was filed by either the actor or the organisers about the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, the organisers who had invited the Bollywood star for the event went underground as the news spread in the media, particularly social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe organisers turned off their mobile phones and were not reachable the whole day on Friday,\u201d said another reporter from Surat.\n\nThe actor was reportedly provoked by a question posed by a man during a Holi event",
