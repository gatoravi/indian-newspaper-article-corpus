    "text": "\u201cThe Indian High Commissioner was summoned by the Foreign Secretary and through a demarche, conveyed our protest and deep concern on the illegal entry into Pakistan by a RAW officer and his involvement in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi,\u201d a Pakistan foreign ministry statement said.\n\nHowever, officials denied that any documents had been handed over, and were able to verify the identity of the former Naval officer on the \u201cbasis of the name provided by Pakistan.\u201d The arrested former official is believed to have been flown to Islamabad, where he will be further interrogated.\n\nSources told The Hindu that during the conversation, Pakistani FS Mr. Chaudhury said the arrest was in line with previous protests by Pakistan over what it calls Indian support to Baloch national groups, waging an insurgency in Pakistan. India has denied the charges of any involvement, but this is the first time Pakistan has alleged it has arrested a serving officer of the external intelligence agency R&AW.\n\nThe case has dominated Pakistani headlines after the details of the arrest of Mr. Yadav on March 21 were disclosed to the media. According to State Interior Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti, the arrest took place in the Chaman area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and Mr. Yadav had disclosed his real name, and said he worked for the R&AW and the Afghanistan intelligence agency NDS. \u201c\u201cIt has been our contention that RAW has been involved (in creating unrest) in Balochistan,\u201d Mr. Bugti told reporters on Friday.\n\nAccording to intelligence officials in Pakistan, Mr. Yadav had entered Pakistan illegally through the border with Iran. While sources in the government said they had no information on why he would have crossed over from Iran, they said he was believed to be contracted privately with a construction project linked to the Chabahar port in Iran. Significantly, the arrest was announced on the day Iranian President Rouhani landed in Pakistan for a bilateral visit.\n\nIn India, military sources refused to comment on the issue. However one official, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, pointed out that the speed of the MEA statement acknowledging the identity of the arrested man indicated that India had been given prior information about the arrest.\n\nIt is understood that NSA Ajit Doval has been in regular contact with the Pakistan NSA Janjua, with unconfirmed reports that they had shared intelligence on terror inputs as well in the past two months. The arrest comes a week before Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif travel to Washington to attend the Nuclear Security Summit on March 31. While no bilateral meeting has been confirmed by either side, the arrest in Balochistan is likely to come up in future talks between both countries, officials said.",
