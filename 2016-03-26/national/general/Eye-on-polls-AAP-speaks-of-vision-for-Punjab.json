There are problems with health and education across the State,\u201d he said, adding that the deteriorating law and order under the Akali-BJP rule was another big issue.\n\nThe walk will culminate at Husainiwala in Ferozepur district on April 5 and will cover around 180 villages and towns. \u201cThere is great response for the Nawa Punjab march that is being carried out on the roads of Punjab with the youth energising for change,\u201d said Suchha Singh Chhotepur, State convener of the AAP, in a tweet.\n\nThe AAP, which has four Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab, sees itself as a major force in State\u2019s political arena.",
