    "text": "A face-scanning police car with cameras on its roof has been developed by a Chinese university and could help in chasing and arresting wanted criminals.\n\nThe intelligent vehicle, developed by University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in Sichuan Province, will be first tested in east Zhejiang Province in June, the university said.\n\nThe police car is equipped with rooftop cameras that capture faces within a radius of 60 metres, even at a speed of 120 km per hour.\n\nThe images are then sent through the police database and if matches are found, an alarm is sounded. Its other functions include detecting vehicle information and identifying mobile phones in its proximity. Its engines also consume less oil and discharge less carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cThe new car is not just a means of transportation. It is more like a smart law enforcement system on wheels,\u201d said Yin Guangqiang, director of the police-use advanced technology institute at the university.\n\nChina\u2019s police cars are mostly refitted with commercial car models according to the needs of local authorities.\n\nThe new cars will address many problems resulting from this poor standardisation, he said. The country\u2019s first standardised police vehicle was developed over seven months. \u2014 PTI\n\nIt is equipped with rooftop cameras that capture faces even at a speed of 120 km per hour",
