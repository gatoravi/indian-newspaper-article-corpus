Sanap in the 26/11 trial against Abu Jundal, one of the alleged plotters of the Mumbai attacks, Headley denied that former Pakistan Prime Minister was present at the funeral of his father on December 25, 2008. \u201cThe former Pakistan Prime Minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, visited my house a few weeks after my father\u2019s demise on December 25, 2008,\u201d he told the court. He said his father had objected to Headley\u2019s association with terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).\n\nIn another shocking disclosure, Headley said that in a conversation he had with fellow convict Dr Tahawwur Hussain Rana in September 2009, he had said that all the nine attackers who were killed in anti-terror operations during the 26/11 attacks should receive the highest gallantry awards of Pakistani military, \u201cNishan-e-Haider.\u201d\n\nReferring to the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the 55-year-old told the court that he had hated India and Indians since childhood as his school had been bombed in December 1971 by Indian fighter planes. The bombings destroyed the school and killed some employees, he said. Headley said he wanted to cause maximum damage and loss to India.\n\nHe said that one of the reasons for him joining the LeT was to avenge the bombing, and hence he travelled to Kashmir to assist separatists fighting the Indian troops.",
