They have said that it\u2019s a bug and will be fixed soon,\u201d JNUSU vice-president Shehla Rshid said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMy own take on it is that Google Locations are linked with the user reviews, apart from Wikipedia and news results. If we search \u2018leftist\u2019, for example, that too redirects to JNU on the map because many user reviews describe it as \u2018leftist\u2019. RSS trolls have systematically flooded the Google Reviews of the place (JNU) with tags like anti national, terrorist, etc. And then, when the algorithm was successfully manipulated, they took screenshots and are now circulating it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, who goes searching for \u2018anti-national\u2019 on Google Maps? We don't need to look for \u2018anti-national\u2019 on Google Maps when everyone knows that the address of anti-nationals is in Nagpur at (the) RSS headquarters,\u201d she added.\n\nLast month, JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and two other students were arrested on charges of sedition and jailed. All three are out on bail. They allegedly participated in anti-national activities on February 9 during an event organised on the campus to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.\n\nIn a similar incident last year, users of Google Maps were directed to the White House when they searched for \u201cnigger house.\u201d Google later apologised for it.",
