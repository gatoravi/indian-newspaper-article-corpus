The process involved a fair amount of research, interaction with rural women, disseminating information through videos and improving access to loans, seeds and fertilizers,\u201d says Ms. Aruna, adding that her husband and founder of the web portal, Gali Uday Kumar, supports her in every endeavour.\n\nApart from dealing with themes \u2014 Create a better world; Beware of Anti-Ragging Act; Domestic Violence against Women; Sanitation matters; environmental issues \u2014 in both English and Telugu, the blog also offers free downloads of e-books. \u201cWe conduct workshops in schools and colleges and encourage students to generate ideas on waste management and environment conservation. Incorporating games, radio activities and storytelling sessions, we try to bring about attitudinal change among young minds, making it easy for them to absorb, internalise the content and pass it on,\u201d explains Ms. Aruna who won the National Human Rights Champion Award and Best Performing Project Officer Award for promoting environment education.\n\nAruna Gali\u2019s work chosen for bringing to the fore issues faced by women in agriculture sector",
