However, in reality, she said the BJP and the Congress governments had through a conspiracy deemed the policy \u201cineffective,\u201d she said. A key constitutional right of the Dalits, the reservation were reduced to something only on paper and being cosmetic, she said. The Congress and the BJP governments were not honest in implementing the policy as part of a conspiracy, but were today talking of the review of reservations, she alleged.\n\nThe RSS-BJP\u2019s Hindutvavadi mentality was clearly reflected through its stance on reservations, she said. She urged the BJP to seek forgiveness from the real children of \u201cBharat Mata,\u201d the Dalits and backwards for the oppression faced by them and non implementation of the quota policy in its true spirit.",
