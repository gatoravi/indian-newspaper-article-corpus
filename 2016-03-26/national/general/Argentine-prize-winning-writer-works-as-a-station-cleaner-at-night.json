    "text": "Enrique Ferrari slips into a double life with ease - as a cleaner and prize-winning writer\n\nWhen the Buenos Aires subway closes at night, Enrique Ferrari goes underground to mop the platforms \u2014 and to polish his next thriller.\n\nThe Argentine station cleaner, 44, with bags under his eyes, is also a prize-winning crime novelist. He has been published in several countries, but it is the night-time cleaning job which puts food on the table for his three children. \u201cLive off writing? The money isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he says.\n\nA representative for cleaning and other unskilled staff in the subway workers\u2019 union, he is seen as a curiosity: a decorated writer who has never been to university. The author \u2014 and his gritty, succinct prose \u2014 has caught the media\u2019s eye, appearing on television, radio and in news reports where he has been dubbed the \u201csubway writer\u201d. But he is fed up with the sobriquet.\n\n\u201cI understand that people find it surprising, but I am not a strange creature,\u201d says Mr. Ferrari, an easygoing man who himself laughs about his disparate vocations.\n\n\u201cIt is a peculiarity of capitalists and the bourgeoisie to think that we workers have no culture,\u201d adds the novelist, whose many tattoos include one of Karl Marx on his left arm.\n\nMr. Ferrari has published five novels and two collections of short stories. His murder mystery Que De Lejos Parecen moscas ( They Look Like Flies From A Distance ) won a prize at the prestigious Gijon crime writing festival in Spain in 2012. That got him published in France, Mexico and Italy. Previously he won a prize in Cuba for Lo Que No Fue ( What Was Not ), a political thriller set in Barcelona during the Spanish civil war.\n\nWriting during breaks\n\nIn the subway, he clears up commuters\u2019 rubbish in an environment that reflects the dark settings of his crime fiction.\n\n\u201cI work in an abandoned city. In a universe which is always overpopulated, I come along after the party.\u201d In the brief breaks during his cleaning shift, he switches on an old laptop and polishes his manuscripts.\n\n\u201cI write whenever I can, wherever I can,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough during the day I\u2019m most interested in finding time to sleep.\u201d\n\nHis other work space is a little table piled with books in a corner of his apartment in the Once district of Buenos Aires.\n\nHe has worked as a baker, driver and street vendor. He spent three years living illegally in the United States before being deported, but came back home with his first novel, Operation Bukowski , published in Buenos Aires in 2004.\n\nA fan of River Plate football club and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music, Mr. Ferrari grew up in a modest home. When he was eight, his father gave him a book from the Sandokan series, pirate adventure novels by the early 20th-century Italian writer Emilio Salgari. \u201cInstead of dreaming of being a pirate, I dreamed of writing without stopping, like Salgari.\u201d\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to go the same way as his literary hero. \u201cSalgari ended up committing suicide. He was tired of the publishers sucking his blood,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wrote them a letter saying: \u2018I bid you farewell as I break my pen.\u2019 I\u2019m going to tattoo that on myself,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite the prizes he has won, Mr. Ferrari is on the margins of the literary scene, shunned by major publishers. \u201cI do not think of literature as a career,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut at quarter to eleven, 15 minutes before I go to mop the floors, I dream of winning an international prize or of Steven Spielberg wanting to film one of my books.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
