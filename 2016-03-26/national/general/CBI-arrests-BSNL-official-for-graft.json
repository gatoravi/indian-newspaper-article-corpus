    "text": "A general manager with the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from a contractor.\n\nAccording to CBI officials, Subhash Kamble was employed as GM of the Ratnagiri branch of the BSNL and was holding additional charge of the Sindhudurg branch.\n\nThe Ratnagiri branch had outsourced the job of installing cables for new connections and other related work to a private contractor in the area. The contractor had recently submitted his bills for the services rendered.\n\nIn exchange for getting the bills approved, Kamble was allegedly demanding a three per cent cut in the bill amount, which came up to Rs 2 lakh. The contractor then approached the CBI\u2019s Anti-Corruption Bureau.\n\n\u201cIn order to evade detection, Kamble had asked the complainant to pay the bribe amount through a civilian, identified as Tanveer. As a further precaution from authorities, Tanveer asked the complainant to transfer the amount to his friend\u2019s account,\u201d said a CBI official.\n\nActing on the CBI\u2019s instructions, the complainant transferred the money to the account specified by Tanveer.\n\nAs soon as the money was transferred, the CBI arrested Tanveer.",
