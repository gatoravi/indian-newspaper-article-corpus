    "text": "The 143 names had a fair share of Yadavs and Muslims\n\nThe ruling Samajwadi Party on Friday released the first list of candidates for the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.\n\nCabinet Minister and brother of SP supremo Mulayam Singh, Shivpal Singh Yadav, released the list of candidates for 143 seats. In the 403-member Assembly, the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP enjoys a convincing majority with 226 MLAs. The list of candidates named is from constituencies where the SP does not hold the seat. The 143 names had a fair share of the SP\u2019s core support communities, the Yadavs and the Muslims. The list included 12 women candidates. Twenty-one seats are reserved.\n\nMr. Shivpal Singh Yadav, PWD Minister, said the rationale behind releasing the names of candidates in seats where the SP lost in 2012 was to allow them time to prepare. The polls are expected in less than a year.",
