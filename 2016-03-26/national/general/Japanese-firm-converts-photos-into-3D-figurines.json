Well now you can be sure they are watching over you thanks to a Japanese company that can turn old photos into 3D figurines.\n\nRoice Entertainment is offering the full-body figures up to 30-cm tall in the spitting image of lost loved ones using 3D printing technology.\n\nAs an optional add-on, a tiny battery-sized container made of brass in which ashes can be kept is available and can be inserted in the figure, the Osaka-based company said. Its website shows a figurine of a silver-haired man in a Japanese yukata robe sitting on the floor, next to a photo of him alive in a similar pose.\n\nThe idea came after a mother who had lost her teenage daughter asked the company if they could turn old photos into a 3D likeness, company president Koichi Furusho said.\n\nA 20-cm plaster figure costs 100,000 yen (Rs. 60,000). \u2014 AFP",
