    "text": "YSR Congress MLA R.K. Roja has said that she is prepared to appear before the Privileges Committee of the Andhra Pradesh legislature but asserted that she will continue the fight against her suspension in court.\n\nThe ruling party was indulging in character assassination by distorting facts and she was determined to continue her fight against this. Ms. Roja made it clear that her suspension and the remarks she made against TDP MLA V. Anita were two different issues, but the ruling party was mixing them up to create confusion among the people.\n\n\u201cThe issue before the Privileges Committee is about my comments against Ms. Anita while my suspension came in the backdrop of the alleged remarks I made against Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu regarding the call money sex racket,\u201d she said exuding confidence that she would give a fitting reply to the TDP\u2019s efforts to malign her image.\n\nShe reiterated that her suspension under Rule 340 (2) was invalid as it did not permit suspension of the members for one year. The rule only allows suspension for the remainder of the session in question. Legislative Affairs Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu\u2019s claim that the rule had been wrongly quoted would not hold water as he had a long experience in the legislature in various capacities.\n\nShe also questioned the rationale behind her suspension for using the term Ca.Ma which was an abbreviation for call money. \u201cHow can I be faulted for raising the issue which rocked the State?\u201d she asked alleging that the TDP president was trying methodically to defame her. \u201cThis is evident from the fact that I had been singled out when more than 30 members were raising the slogans on the day,\u201d she said.",
