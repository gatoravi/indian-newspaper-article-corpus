One cannot segregate students from realpolitik in a democratic system as all decisions are taken in Parliament, and education is not an exception.\u201d\n\nMr. Kumar said universities were centres to promote critical thinking. \u201cThere is an allegation that we are indulging in politics. Who is indulging in politics, we or the government? It (the government) has a script to destroy the autonomy of universities. The motto of universities, intellectuals is to promote critical thinking,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said there were several movements taking place in India and elsewhere. The neo-liberal forces are getting aggressive. \u201cThe fine example is Donald Trump, the presidential candidate of the U.S. His policies could be dangerous,\u201d Mr Kumar said. The concept of a welfare state was gradually being demolished and the repercussions were felt by students as well. \u201cThis is not just happening in India \u2014 it is a world phenomenon.\u201d\n\nNeo-liberal forces getting aggressive in India and other countries, says the student leader",
