I also like Metallica and Megadeth,\u201d a soft-spoken Mr. Sekino said. \u201cThey may look demonic from the Christian church\u2019s point of view, but they are actually shouting to fight the world\u2019s injustice. They talk about truth, no hypocrisy,\u201d he said.\n\nMonk Yoshinobu Fujioka \u2014 head shaved and wearing a dark blue kimono \u2014 hits back with an acoustic guitar offering as head of the Bozu (monk) band.\n\n\u201cI love the Blues. I love Bob Dylan and sixties music,\u201d said the 39-year-old.\n\nSinging about pain\n\n\u201cLiving a worldly life, we always get hurt by pains and suffering which make us feel small. I like to sing about that pain in a tender way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe unlikely pair hope their musical duels help them reach more people in a country where Buddhists far outnumber Christians. Figures released by the government based on data supplied by temples, churches and shrines show that Buddhism accounts for about 46 per cent of religious followers, while Christians make up less than two per cent. About 48 per cent, meanwhile, follow Japan\u2019s native Shinto religion.\n\nBut for many Japanese, religion of any sort is more of a seasonal formality, paying homage at a shrine or celebrating Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually performing secular music. We have feelings just like other people and use the same language, sometimes even more crass,\u201d said Mr. Sekino, who turned to heavenly work after his sister became critically ill. \u201cBut I want people to know that God lives there (in people\u2019s lives). I want to share this,\u201d he said.\n\nOpened a bar\n\nMr. Fujioka and his fellow monk-cum-rockers also opened a bar in Tokyo, where they offer another outlet for troubled visitors seeking a better life \u2014 over cocktails.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who want to talk about their problems and go home with a lighter heart. It\u2019s our responsibility to meet with people like that,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sekino initially contacted the monk about his quirky idea for musical evangelism and now they perform several times a year \u2014 with backing from above. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should call this heaven or nirvana, but I think this is what the God would want to see \u2014 this is something the church or a temple couldn\u2019t do\u201d, he said. \u2014 AFP",
