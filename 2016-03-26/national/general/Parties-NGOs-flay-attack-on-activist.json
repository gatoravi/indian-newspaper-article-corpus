It was therefore premeditated,\u201d Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares claimed on Friday and said the NGO plans to move state Human Rights Commission. Alvares added the incident will delay total resumption of mining operations indefinitely.\n\n\u201cVelip has consistently exposed illegalities committed by mining lease holders in Caurem. It was due to the efforts of his group that authorities located lakhs of tonnes of iron ore illegally extracted and hidden in artificial mountains under layers of mud after mining was suspended by the government,\u201d Alvares said.\n\nHe said Velip had informed the State Mining Directorate that excess amounts of ore discovered by his group of villagers have now been removed in the name of e-auction, especially since the directorate has no staff to monitor movement of trucks. Alvares warned that the situation is fast reverting to unmonitored movement of ore in the mining belt.",
