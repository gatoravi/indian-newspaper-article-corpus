    "text": "The pontiff washed and kissed the feet of migrants at an Easter Week ceremony\n\nPope Francis washed and kissed the feet of Muslim, Orthodox, Hindu and Catholic refugees Thursday, declaring them children of the same God, in a gesture of welcome and brotherhood at a time when anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment has spiked following the Brussels attacks.\n\nThe Holy Thursday rite re-enacts the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his apostles before being crucified, and is meant as a gesture of service. The Pope contrasted that gesture with the \u201cgesture of destruction\u201d carried out by the Brussels attackers, saying they wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity represented by the migrants.\n\n\u201cWe have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,\u201d Francis said in his homily, delivered off-the-cuff in the windy courtyard of the refugee shelter outside Rome.\n\nSeveral of the migrants wept as Francis knelt before them, poured holy water from a brass pitcher over their feet, wiped them clean and kissed them.\n\nThe Vatican said that four women and eight men took part. The women included an Italian Catholic who works at the shelter and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria, three Muslims from Mali, Syria and Pakistan and a Hindu man from India. \u2014 AP",
