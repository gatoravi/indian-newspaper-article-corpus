The extradition cell of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has now initiated the process of confirming his identity before he can be extradited.\n\nRed Corner Notice\n\nThe Hindu had reported how Mohamed, who had landed in Mumbai from Qatar, was detained by the Immigration authorities at the Chhatrapati Shivaji airport after his name was flagged in an RCN, and handed over to the Extradition Cell.\n\nPrima facie inquiries indicate that Mohamed was part of the widespread violence that ripped through Egypt in 2013 following the ouster of the then President Mohammed Morsi.\n\nOn Friday, Mohamed was produced in a holiday court and was remanded in judicial custody till Monday. \u201cAs it was the weekend, we produced Mohamed in a holiday court. We will produce him in a regular court on Monday and will seek further custody while the necessary formalities are completed,\u201d said a Crime Branch officer.\n\nThe Crime Branch is now drafting a letter to be sent to Egypt through the Ministry of External Affairs, asking for particulars of Mohamed\u2019s identity, including his photographs and fingerprints. \u201cOnce these are received, we will compare them with those of the suspect in our custody. Once we have formal confirmation of his identity, the extradition process will begin. The identification process is crucial. Even when Kumar Pillai was held in Singapore, we had to wait till the Singapore government confirmed his identity before we could begin the extradition process,\u201d the officer said.\n\nThe Crime Branch has also sought details of the case against Mohamed from the Egyptian authorities.\n\nMumbai Police\n\nare trying to\n\nconfirm his\n\nidentity before extraditing him",
