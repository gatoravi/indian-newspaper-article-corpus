They will go back after three days,\u201d Ms. Banerjee said at a rally at Lalgarh in the Jangalmahal region, which will go to polls in the first phase of the Assembly elections.\n\nTo boost the confidence of her supporters, Ms. Banerjee said: \u201cI am not dead. I will always fight.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came on a day when a delegation of the ruling Trinamool Congress met the State\u2019s Chief Electoral Officer, claiming that six party workers were killed.\n\n\u201cEvery day they are killing (our party workers). Who gave them the right to kill? We will not tolerate killing. There is no place for political vendetta in Bengal,\u201d Ms. Banerjee said.\n\nTMC vice-president Mukul Roy asserted that in case of another murder, the party would bring the functionary\u2019s body to the CEO\u2019s office as law and order was \u201cthe responsibility of the Election Commission now.\u201d He claimed that no worker of other parties had died in this election season.\n\nOnly a few days ago, the Chief Minister took a jibe at the Opposition parties, asking them to get police \u201cfrom the United States\u201d if they did not have faith in the Bengal police.\n\nThe Chief Minister also tried to highlight the atmosphere of peace in Jangalmahal, saying her government had \u201cbrought back\u201d to the mainstream the youth who had strayed on to the path of left-wing extremism. \u201cHundreds of people were killed due to violence in Jangalmahal. There are no killings now,\u201d she said, adding that sports and cultural activities were flourishing there.\n\n( With inputs from PTI)",
