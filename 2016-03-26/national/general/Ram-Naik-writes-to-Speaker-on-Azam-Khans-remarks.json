    "text": "The U.P. Minister had accused Ram Naik of working under the influence of a party\n\nReacting to Uttar Pradesh Cabinet Minister Azam Khan\u2019s alleged controversial remarks about him in the Assembly, Governor Ram Naik on Friday said the statements raised \u201cquestions\u201d about his capability. Mr. Naik said he would discuss the issue with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, even as he shot off a letter expressing his concern to Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey.\n\nEarlier this month, concerned over Mr. Khan\u2019s critical references to him in his speech in the House, Mr. Naik asked the Speaker to provide him the unedited copies \u2014 audio and video CDs \u2014 of the statement. In his address to the Assembly on March 8, Mr. Khan had accused Mr. Naik of stalling several bills by not giving his assent and suggested that it gave an impression that the Governor was working under the \u201cinfluence of a party.\u201d\n\nReferences were made to the U.P. Nagar Nigam Amendment Bill 2015.\n\nAfter reviewing the unedited transcript of Mr. Khan\u2019s statement, Mr. Naik said the expunging of around 33 per cent of Mr. Khan\u2019s statement in the Vidhan Sabha showed that the Minister\u2019s \u201clanguage was not favourable to the dignity and tradition of the House.\u201d Out of 60 paragraphs in Mr. Khan\u2019s speech, 20 were expunged. Mr. Khan\u2019s statement raised a \u201cquestion mark\u201d on whether he was \u201ccapable\u201d of executing his duty, Mr. Naik said in his letter to Mr. Pandey.\n\nWar of words\n\nEver since Mr. Naik\u2019s appointment as Governor of U.P., he has shared a sour relationship with the SP leader, with the two engaging in a war of words on many occasions. Mr. Khan accused the Governor of acting like a \u201c karsevak \u201d and \u201ccommunally vitiating\u201d the atmosphere in the State at the behest of the NDA government at the Centre.\n\nMr. Khan had even written a four-page letter to Mr. Naik, accusing him of adopting a negative approach towards him.\n\nWhile Mr. Naik has taken veiled pot shots at the SP leader, last year he had suggested that the controversy surrounding his \u201cpro-activism\u201d stemmed from Mr. Khan\u2019s inability to digest his cordial relations with the junior Yadav.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Naik also asserted that he was sensitive to people\u2019s issues through his political journey to the Raj Bhavan.\n\nOut of 60 paragraphs in Azam Khan\u2019s speech in the Assembly, 20 were expunged",
