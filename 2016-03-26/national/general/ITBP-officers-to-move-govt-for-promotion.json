It merged all cadres of the ITBP, including drivers, telecom operators and engineers, with the general duty cadre who are deployed in combat roles. It also decided that promotion be done on the basis of the combined seniority list. The decision was challenged in the Delhi High Court, which stayed it in 2013. In May 2015, the High Court struck it down.\n\nOfficials say the MHA and the ITBP, headed by IPS officers, have failed to resolve the crisis. \u201cThough there are many vacancies in the rank of Deputy Commandant and Assistant Commandant, the inspectors have to retire without promotion. There is a lot of anger among the rank and file as they are deprived of their right owing to these bureaucratic procedures,\u201d an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn 2012 alone, 13 inspectors retired without any promotion.\n\nThe pattern followed in the following years: 19 inspectors retired in 2013 and 11 each in 2014 and 2015 without promotion.",
