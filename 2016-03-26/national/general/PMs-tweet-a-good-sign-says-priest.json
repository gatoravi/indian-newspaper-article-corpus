    "text": "Father Paul Thelakkat, a senior Catholic priest, said, \u201cNormally, people don\u2019t greet each other on the day Jesus was crucified. It is the tragedy of the cross which is remembered on this day. I do not wish to accuse them [Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Cabinet colleagues] as I wonder whether they are aware of the nuance of the day. This kind of niceties they need not know.\u201d\n\nAs some of the Ministers deleted their tweets after lessons were given to them on Twitter, @OfficeOfRg, the official website of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, \u201cOn Good Friday a day of reflection and prayer, may the spirit of love, compassion and sacrifice guide our thoughts and action.\u201d\n\nOn the PM\u2019s tweet, \u201cGood Friday is a day of prayer & a day to remember the noble, pious & compassionate thoughts of Jesus Christ that touched many lives,\u201d Father Thelakkat said: \u201cThe greeting was unusual as the Prime Minister is known to keep his silence. This time, he remembered. I think it is a good sign.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s tweet led to a minor change on Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu\u2019s twitter handle.\n\nHe struck a sombre note with this message, \u201cToday we commemorate the passion, suffering, death on the cross of Jesus Christ. May this day of prayer enlighten our mind and bring peace.\u201d\n\nThe observance of Good Friday was also noted by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose tweet \u201cDrawing inspiration from the teachings of Jesus on this Good Friday,\u201d was criticised for drawing political mileage.",
