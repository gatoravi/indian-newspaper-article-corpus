They also point out that while video conferences might work for technical conversations, most interlocutors will not discuss classified, political or strategic matters over a telephone or computer.\n\nThe MEA is equally upset by the stipulation that \u201cno officer shall undertake more than 4 visits abroad in a [calendar] year.\u201d\n\nWhile the rule on four visits was introduced in 2006, this year\u2019s memorandum says all visits by Secretaries to the government exceeding four visits must be approved by the Prime Minister himself, through the Screening Committee of Secretaries (SCoS).\n\n\u201cThe Foreign Secretary completed four visits abroad within the month of January itself,\u201d one official says, explaining that MEA officials, by definition must travel more than others, \u201cDoes that mean he has to submit himself to this process every time he travels in the next 11 months?.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the Prime Minister already too occupied, to have to clear these as well?\u201d asks another official.\n\nAsked for a response, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson refused to comment on \u201cinternal Government of India processes.\u201d The Hindu sent a detailed questionnaire to the Ministry of Finance on Friday, but received no official response.\n\nMEA officials say until the issues are resolved, however, their ability to give political clearances will be hampered by the new regulations.\n\nMost interlocutors will not discuss sensitive matters over a telephone or computer",
