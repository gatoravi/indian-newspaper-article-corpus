Sant Ravidas, who stood against institutionalised caste hierarchy, has a huge following among Dalits in Punjab and U.P.\n\nMr. Modi visited the Ravidas temple, where he also took part in a langar. He was soon followed by Mr. Kejriwal.\n\nBSP chief Mayawati said on Mr. Modi\u2019s visit: \u201cit is only by following the teachings and actions of Sant Ravidas can someone become a better human being.\u201d",
