The court held that the victim-petitioner would suffer tremendous mental trauma if she continued with the pregnancy which was the result of the rape.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner-victim has crumbled physically and mentally on account of rape \u2026 she has survived after consuming liquid in the form of acid and her condition is not sound that she may deliver the child inasmuch as her organs such as esophagus, liver, etc., are seriously damaged \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018Mental health affected\u2019\n\n\u201cSince this continuance of pregnancy involves grave injury to her mental health as her pregnancy being the result of rape, the anguish caused is also to be constituted as a grave injury to the mental health of the victim, and therefore also, termination of pregnancy is permitted,\u201d the court observed in its 15-page judgment.\n\nLast week, the court directed the civil hospital in Sola to examine the mental and physical status of the victim to check if the pregnancy could be terminated.",
