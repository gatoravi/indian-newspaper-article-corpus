Khehar, is looking into the constitutionality of State Governor J.P. Rajkhowa\u2019s move to advance the Arunachal Assembly session, which eventually triggered a political crisis that lead to the ouster of the Congress-led Nabam Tuki government and proclamation of emergency in the State on January 26 this year.\n\nEarlier in the day, the State\u2019s Congress leaders moved the apex court against the manner in which the President\u2019s rule was withdrawn without the Supreme Court\u2019s knowledge and the formation of the Pul government in the next three hours on February 19.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court hearing got over at 4 p.m. The proclamation of emergency is lifted at 6.30 p.m. and at 10 p.m., the new government under Kalikho Pul is sworn in on February 19,\u201d senior advocate Kapil Sibal submitted.\n\n\u201cArunachal Pradesh is an experiment... this is the way they will topple governments in other States. Everything we feared came true,\u201d Mr. Sibal, accompanied by senior advocate Fali Nariman, submitted.\n\n\u201cIf so, then this is a deadly experiment... there may be a thought that this is in distant Arunachal Pradesh. But even so, our judgment will have an impact all over the country,\u201d Justice Khehar responded.\n\nBut the Bench refused to take up the issue of the formation of the Pul government, saying \u201cthis is a legislative matter and we will not interfere\u201d.\n\nComprehensive dealing\n\nThe court told the Congress leaders that it should be allowed to comprehensively deal with the issue rather than in a piecemeal, \u201chotchpotch\u201d fashion.\n\nMr. Nariman pointed out that State Governor J.P. Rajkhowa was party to this litigation, his counsel was present in the courtroom on February 19, yet did not consider to inform the Bench about his plans to recommend to the President for withdrawal of the proclamation of emergency issued on January 26.\n\nThe senior lawyer said the court might continue to hear the case, but \u201cmeanwhile, they will buy more MLAs and go on to form a two-third majority\u201d. \u201cYou should have more confidence in us. We will consider all the issues. Please read the paragraph in the S.R. Bommai judgment on our powers of judicial review,\u201d Justice Khehar said.\n\nMr. Sibal pointed out that in the interim between 6.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. \u2014 from the moment the President\u2019s rule was withdrawn to the formation of the Pul government \u2014 no government was in power in Arunachal Pradesh. \u201cOur Constitution does not allow such hiatus,\u201d he submitted. Mr. Sibal contended that the Nabam Tuki government was only in a state of \u201csuspended animation\u201d when President\u2019s rule was proclaimed. On its withdrawal, they should have been re-instated, he said.",
