    "text": "Drawing from the ongoing Jat agitation in Haryana, Rajput organisations in Rajasthan have decided to launch a nation-wide agitation if their demands for reservation remain unmet.\n\nThe agitation would begin by the end of February and would be launched simultaneously in Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. \u201cWe have been peacefully pleading for reservation for the past 15 years. Look at the Jats in Haryana\u2026 they created such chaos that the government had to respond. We will do the same if our demands are not fulfilled,\u201d the Rajasthan president of Shri Rajput Karni Sena, Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, said here on Monday.\n\nThe Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party regimes in the State had, in the past, cleared Bills for reservation for the Rajputs and a few other sections.\n\n\u201cThe Congress and the BJP have been making a fool of us. We want reservation based on economic status and we will protest in front of the Vidhan Sabha [during the upcoming Budget session]. We will also tell the Rajput MLAs to place our demands in the Vidhan Sabha. If they [Rajput MLAs] want our votes, they will have to speak for us,\u201d Mr. Gogamedi said.",
