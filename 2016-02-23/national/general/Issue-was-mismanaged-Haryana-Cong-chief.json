They failed to take prompt action against anti-social elements who tried to disturb peace and harmony,\u201d State Congress chief Ashok Tanwar told The Hindu in an interview.\n\n\u201cCongress always championed the cause of the educationally, socially and economically backward classes and believes in their social empowerment and justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the Congress government that gave reservation to Jats in 2014, which was not handled properly by the State government now.\n\n\u201cThere has been irreparable damage to social harmony and an economic loss of more than Rs. 25,000-crore.\u201d He said the situation had become grim in Haryana in the last few days.\n\nJNU crisis\n\nMr. Tanwar, an alumnus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, blamed the BJP and the RSS for the crisis that has gripped the institution after the arrest of its students\u2019 union president Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\n(For full interview visit http://bit.ly/1RXiUnq)",
