The exact spot where Lord Rama was born [Ram Janmabhoomi] has been, and remains, firmly identified in the Hindu mind and is held as sacred.\u201d\n\nA Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and U.U. Lalit, before which the petition was mentioned, said the petition would be listed in due course before the Bench dealing with other petitions on the dispute. The petition asked the apex court to expedite the adjudication and dispose of the appeals on a decision by the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on September 30, 2010 that Hindus have the right to the makeshift temple under the central dome of the Babri Masjid.",
