After searching for them for hours, he found one of his friends with a head injury in hospital and was told that Mr. Shahbander had been killed.\n\nTwo weeks later, he dreamt that a bomb would go off near a square in central Baghdad and, after waking up, immediately called his friends and his father to tell them.\n\nAn explosion rocked the exact spot later that day.\n\n\u201cMy friends called me to ask me how I knew, it was a very strange thing,\u201d he said, adding it was then that he started looking for ways to express his angst through art.\n\nBaghdad has been rocked by hundreds of car bombs over the years, sometimes several in a day during periods when violence peaked.\n\nThose blasts and other attacks have killed tens of thousands of civilians and left many residents with deep trauma that remains when violence ebbs, as is the case now in the city.\n\nSimple but powerful\n\nAdil thought of a simple performance, during which one of his friends would go about normal daily activities in Baghdad wearing a bomb suit.\n\n\u201cI thought, why isn\u2019t there some kind of outfit that can protect us? Other approaches produced no results so I looked at individual solutions,\u201d Mr. Adil said.\n\nThe decrepit charm of the once glorious Rasheed Street\u2019s ornate arcades and derelict theatres provides an odd backdrop for the dark figure casually walking in full mock ordnance disposal gear.\n\nAs they saw the figure trudging along, arms asway and head ensconced in a massive ballistic collar, some passers-by seemed alarmed or amused. Others barely turned their heads to look.\n\n\u201cI suppose they have their reasons for doing this kind of art, but personally I don\u2019t see what it\u2019s going to change about what our country is going through,\u201d said Abu Ibrahim, a local shop owner.\n\nThe person in the bomb suit walked into buildings to chat with people, ordered tea at a cafe and inquired about prices at a tailor\u2019s shop.\n\n\u201cI could feel people looking at me. Some were laughing, some were perplexed and others looked like they wanted to try it on,\u201d said the young man in the suit.\n\nMr. Adil will repeat the performance in various locations of the capital and wrap up his experiment with a photo exhibit. \u201cI wanted to show the public what we have come to... and plant this question in their heads: what if we all looked like this?\u201d \u2014 AFP",
