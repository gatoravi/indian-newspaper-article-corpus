A few professors also attended the meet.\n\n\u2018Anti-national\u2019\n\nThe next day, the Bharatiya Janata Party Yuva Morcha staged a protest in Shivamogga alleging that some professors of the university were \u201ctrying to inculcate anti-national feelings\u201d among students in the name of Rohith Vemula.\n\nThe BJP activists alleged that Kuvempu University was becoming an \u201cabode of anti-national elements.\u201d Instead of discharging their academic responsibilities, the professors were trying to mislead the students, district BJP Youth Morcha president Bhavani Rao More alleged, and demanded the arrest of the professors for \u201cconspiring against the nation.\u201d\n\nNow the RVNHS has launched a signature campaign to condemn the charges of sedition levelled against the teachers and students.\n\n\u201cThe students and professors respect the right enjoyed by the BJP to stage a protest. However, levelling baseless allegations and labelling us traitors and anti-nationals is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nRajendra Chenni, Chairman, Department of Post-Graduate Studies in English, who was part of the programme, said the event began by observing a minute\u2019s silence for the soldiers who died in Siachen recently. \u201cThe death of Vemula was mourned and the entire programme was held in a dignified manner. None of the students and professors, who addressed the programme, took the name of any political party or organisation. It is unfortunate that charges of sedition are levelled against the participants,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Baseless\u2019\n\nJ. Somashekhar, Registrar of Kuvempu University, said the charges levelled against the students and professors were \u201ctotally baseless.\u201d\n\nThe protest was staged by the students in a peaceful manner. \u201cStudent activism is a trait of a healthy democracy and the university doesn\u2019t like to impose any restrictions,\u201d he said.\n\nStudent activism is a trait of a healthy democracy, says university Registrar J. Somashekhar",
