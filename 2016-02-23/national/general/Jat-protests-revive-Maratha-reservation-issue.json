    "text": "With Jats on the reservation rampage, the long-pending Maratha reservation issue has got a shot in the arm with leaders launching fiery rallies all over the State raising the demand again.\n\nThe new entrant to the already crowded bandwagon of leaders cutting across party lines is Congress MLA Nitesh Rane, son of former Chief Minister and senior party leader Narayan Rane.\n\nMr. Rane has been camping all over the State, from Kolhapur to Latur and from Faltan to Tuljapur, joining hands with the Sambhaji Brigade, an aggressive Maratha organisation, preparing for the \u2018future agitation\u2019 which he claims will escalate in the next two months. While the Congress has maintained a distance from his actions, party sources said it was the Rane family\u2019s attempt to become politically relevant, as it had faced a series of defeats in the last elections.\n\n\u2018No violence\u2019\n\n\u201cMy agenda is clear and that is to attain reservation for the Maratha community at any cost. We do not want to indulge in violence as was witnessed in Haryana, but as I am addressing rallies after rallies, I can see the young men and women from the community are angered. They want it to be done at any cost,\u201d said Mr. Rane.\n\nHis next set of rallies demanding reservation will start from March 6 in Beed. It will be followed by rallies in Hingoli, Jalgaon, Aurangabad etc.\n\n\u201cWe expect very little from the BJP-Sena government. But it is our duty to keep the issue alive. We do not want violence. But I must say that people are angry,\u201d he said.",
