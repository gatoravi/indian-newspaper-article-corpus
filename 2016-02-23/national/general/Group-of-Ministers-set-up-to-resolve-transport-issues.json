    "text": "The Union government has formed an empowered group of State Transport Ministers to resolve transport issues and address issues of road safety in the States, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have formed an empowered group to discuss transport issues at the State level. Rajasthan Transport Minister Yunus Khan will head it,\u201d he said, addressing Ministers from different States here. The group would suggest ways of minimising road accidents, improving the public transport system and boosting the transport sector.\n\nAround 1.5 lakh people are killed in road accidents every year, and the government wants to reduce the number of fatalities by half by 2019.\n\nMr. Gadkari asked the State transport undertakings to convert 17 lakh buses into Bharat VI-compliant or bio-fuel friendly vehicles by 2020 to check pollution.\n\n\u201cYou have to convert your buses to Euro VI norms. There are 17 lakh buses operated by the State Transport Corporations. These have to be upgraded through refurbishing or other means so that they become Euro VI- or bio-fuel compliant,\u201d he said.\n\nVoicing concern over the State transport corporations incurring losses to the tune of Rs. 10,000 crore, Mr. Gadkari suggested slashing fares by half to make profits. Switching to bio-fuels or higher-grade fuels might also help .\n\nSpeaking at another event, Mr. Gadkari said he wanted the government\u2019s focus to be on farmers and labourers than on the corporate sector.\n\nIt will suggest ways to minimise road accidents and improve the public transport system",
