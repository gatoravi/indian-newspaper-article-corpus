We are told she will be in hospital for two or three weeks.\u201d AAP leaders said they want the Chhattisgarh police to arrest the perpetrators.\n\nDelhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal visited Ms. Sori at the hospital and said the incident underlined the need for banning retail sale of acid and harsher punishment for people who commit such crimes. \u201cDespite Supreme Court order, there is no compliance. How did anyone get hold of such a substance,\u201d wondered Ms. Maliwal.",
