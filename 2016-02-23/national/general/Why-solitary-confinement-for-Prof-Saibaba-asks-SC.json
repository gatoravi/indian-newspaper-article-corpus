    "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the logic behind the incarceration of suspended Delhi University professor and paraplegic, G.N. Saibaba, in solitary confinement in Nagpur jail.\n\nProf. Saibaba, who is 90 per cent disabled and wheel-chair bound, is in prison on the charge of having Maoist links. A petition seeking bail for Prof. Saibaba said he was lodged in the notorious Anda Isolation Cell in the Nagpur Central Jail and was in a \u201cprecarious state of health and is now only able to crawl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you need his solitary confinement? He is totally crippled. You cannot have him in solitary confinement. Put him in another place, but not in a jail,\u201d a Bench of Justices J.S. Khehar and C. Nagappan quizzed the Maharashtra government's reasoning.\n\nState counsel said the trial had begun in Gadchiroli and grant of bail to Prof. Saibaba might result in his going \u201cunderground.\u201d\n\nTo this, Prof. Saibaba\u2019s counsel and senior advocate R.S. Cheema said his client was granted bail by the High Court for six months due to his failing health.",
