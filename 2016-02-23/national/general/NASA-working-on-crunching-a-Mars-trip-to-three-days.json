    "text": "NASA researchers are working on a technology that could harness the power of light and may be the key to cutting down travel time to Mars from months to as little as three days.\n\nPhilip Lubin, from the University of California, Santa Barbara, is developing the \u2018photonic propulsion\u2019 system where lasers can propel spacecraft with giant sails to the Red Planet.\n\nThe system relies on the momentum of photons \u2014 particles of light \u2014 to move forward. However, instead of photons from the Sun\u2019s rays, Prof. Lubin\u2019s design would be given a push by giant Earth-based lasers.\n\nIn a video for NASA 360, Prof. Lubin explained that the technology is very much readily available, and that the system could easily be scaled up. With our current technology, it is estimated it will take humans around five months to reach Mars, ScienceAlert reported.\n\n\u201cThere are recent advances that take this from science fiction to science reality,\u201d said Prof. Lubin.\n\nWhen a spacecraft is launched, the thrust comes from burning a chemical, such as rocket fuel. This fuel weighs down the spacecraft.\n\nIt is an inefficient system when compared to using light or other electromagnetic radiation to accelerate objects.\n\n\u201cElectromagnetic acceleration is only limited by the speed of light while chemical systems are limited to the energy of chemical processes,\u201d Prof. Lubin said.\n\nThe system is not designed to send humans across interstellar distances. Instead, Prof. Lubin proposes wafer-thin spacecraft that can get close to the speed of light. \u2014 PTI",
