Preliminary reports suggest the building was \u201cidentified as vulnerable\u201d in the backdrop of Qasim\u2019s plans to take over hotels and building to carry out \u2018spectacular\u2019 attacks. In fact, Qasim was behind a Mumbai-type abortive bid to take over a hotel, Silver Star, frequented by non-locals on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway on October 10, 2012.",
