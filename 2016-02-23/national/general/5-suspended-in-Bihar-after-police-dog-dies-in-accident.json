    "text": "Five policemen, including a sub-inspector, were suspended on Monday after an inquiry report on the death of a police dog blamed them for negligence. The dog named Gulabo died on February 8 in a road accident in Rohtas district of the State.\n\nShe was inducted into the dog squad of the Bihar police force only last month.\n\nGulabo, holding the rank of a sub-inspector herself, was run over by a speeding lorry as she tried to cross a road in Rohtas, a naxal-affected district of South Bihar. She died on the spot. The IG had ordered an inquiry by a police official B.D. Ram, who said in his report that the policemen had gone out leaving the dog unchained in her kennel.\n\nThe suspended policemen, however, said the dog unchained herself and came out of the kennel. Gulabo, a trained sniffer dog, was one of the 45 bought recently by the Bihar police from the Indian Army College of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh for Rs 63.53 lakh.\n\nGulabo, holding the rank of a Sub-Inspector, was run over by a speeding lorry",
