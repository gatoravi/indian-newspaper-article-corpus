Khalid, one of the five students accused of sedition, returned to the campus on Sunday.\u2014 Photo: PTI\n\nThe Supreme Court said on Monday that there was \u201cnothing explosive\u201d in the reports filed separately in sealed covers by the Delhi Police, the Registrar General of Delhi High Court and its own team of lawyers who visited the Patiala House courts to take stock of the mob violence of February 17. All they contained were \u201callegations and counter-allegations.\u201d\n\nThe police and the Delhi High Court seemed to agree in their reports that the JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar was not assaulted inside the courtroom as mentioned by the lawyers\u2019 team. According to the lawyers\u2019 team, Kumar was \u201cthumped\u201d by a \u201cgentleman in dark glasses\u201d inside the courtroom in the presence of senior police officers and the Registrar General of the High Court.\n\nSenior advocate Rajeev Dhawan, who was in the six-member lawyers\u2019 team sent by the Supreme Court, told a Bench of Justices J. Chelameswar and A.M. Sapre that the police did not intervene despite the Registrar General asking them to.\n\nPolice disagree\n\nMr. Dhawan, who admitted that the lawyers\u2019 team was not witness to this incident, said it happened despite strict orders from the Supreme Court to restrict entry and exit into the court complex.\n\nHowever, Delhi Police counsel and senior advocate Ajit Sinha did not agree completely with the report of the lawyers\u2019 team and refused to sign it. Instead, he separately filed a one-page report in the Supreme Court.\n\nAll the reports were filed in sealed covers and the Bench ordered that they could be distributed in the next three days from the apex court registry.\n\nDuring the hearing, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar asked the court for an assurance that the reports, if released to the media, would not \u201cinfluence\u201d the Delhi High Court\u2019s hearing of Kanhaiya Kumar\u2019s bail application on February 23.\n\nPlea disallowed\n\nThe Bench refused to entertain a petition filed by the Karkardooma Bar Association alleging that \u201ccultural celebration\u201d organised by the JNU students was in actuality an occasion to condemn the Supreme Court judgment to execute Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru as a \u201cjudicial killing.\u201d",
