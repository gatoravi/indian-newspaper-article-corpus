    "text": "In New York City, there\u2019s no escaping the pressure to be taller and thinner not even for the skyscrapers.\n\nChanges in building technology and materials in recent years have made it possible to build slender towers that are among the tallest in the world. And some of these cloud-puncturing beanstalks are poised to transform the city\u2019s iconic skyline.\n\nSo far, the thinnest of all is the recently completed apartment tower at 432 Park Avenue. The stark white pillar, just south of Central Park, is 1,396 feet tall, but each side is only about 93 feet wide.\n\nThat\u2019s higher than the Empire State Building, but only as wide as the length of a basketball court.\n\nPlans are in place for another tower just a few blocks away that could be the skinniest skyscraper in the world. The tower would be about 1,400 feet tall and under 60 feet wide.\n\nThose tiny footprints are a sharp departure from super-tall skyscrapers of the past. The base of the Empire State Building, for example, occupies an entire city block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of advancements that allows us to build,\u201d said Ahmad Rahimian, USA Director of Building Structures at WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering firm that works on such projects. \u2014 AP",
