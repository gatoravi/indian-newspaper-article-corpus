Mr. Gopalakrishnan said certain quarters, including the government and government agencies such as the Forest Department, were trying to impede the smooth functioning of the boards.\n\nThe meeting resolved to resist such moves. No one should aspire to curb the functioning of the boards, he said.\n\nThe meeting decided to evolve a system for coordinating the functioning of all devaswom boards in the State. A meeting would be held here on February 27 to discuss the significance of custom and rituals in temples. Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, member of the royal family of the erstwhile State of Travancore, would address the meeting. The next meeting of the boards\u2019 representatives for coordinating the functions of the boards would be held at Guruvayur. The meeting asked Mr. Gopalakrishnan to take forward the initiative.\n\nMr. Gopalakrishnan said special prayer sessions had been planned in all temples under the board on March 7 in connection with the Sivarathri celebrations. It had also been proposed to hold a meeting soon of all organisations involved in Ayyappa Seva.\n\nM.P.
