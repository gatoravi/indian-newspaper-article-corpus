You\u2019re not going to get laid off there,\u201d Mr. Tatsuta said. \u201cBut you\u2019re also working for a goal.\u201d\n\nFive years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck, causing three reactors at Fukushima to melt down, that goal is the focus of a colossal effort at once precarious and routine. A veneer of stability at the plant masks a gruelling, day-to-day battle to contain hazardous radiation, which involves a small army of workers, complex technical challenges and vexing safety trade-offs.\n\nFukushima has become a place where employees arrive on company shuttle buses and shop at their own on-site convenience store, but where they struggle to control radiation-contaminated water and must release it into the sea. Many of the most difficult and dangerous clean-up tasks still lie ahead, and crucial decisions remain unsettled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no precedent or manual,\u201d said Tatsujiro Suzuki, a former vice-chairman of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission, who is now a Professor at Nagasaki University.\n\nThe effort at Fukushima has reached a few milestones. About 1,500 spent fuel rods were successfully removed from a damaged storage tank in late 2014, a delicate and risky operation.\n\nMuch of the contaminated rubble left by the tsunami and hydrogen explosions has been cleared, and overall radiation levels are down. Workers will soon be able to enter some areas of the plant without full-body protective gear.\n\nLong years ahead\n\nBut a full clean-up of the site \u2014 including the extraction of melted uranium fuel from the damaged reactor cores \u2014 is expected to take at least 40 years, according to the government\u2019s timetable, and a century by other estimates. In the meantime, officials acknowledge, Fukushima remains vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Is there a Plan B to deal with another big quake or tsunami?\u201d Mr. Suzuki said.\n\nThe duration of the clean-up also creates the risk of labour shortages, he said, especially in jobs requiring special skills. Japan\u2019s population is shrinking and, with the future of nuclear power uncertain, many young people are unwilling to stake careers on the industry.\n\nFor now, Fukushima is bustling with about 7,000 workers, much more than before the disaster and twice as many as two years ago. The town of Iwaki to the south has become a kind of workers\u2019 village. At dawn, vans and buses line up to ferry workers to the plant via staging areas where they don protective white Tyvek suits, radiation monitors and gas masks.\n\n\u201cYou think of it as totally normal work,\u201d said Tatsuta, who asked to be identified only by his pen name to avoid being blacklisted by the plant\u2019s owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
