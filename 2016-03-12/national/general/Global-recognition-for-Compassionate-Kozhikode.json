Conceived by District Collector N. Prasanth a year ago, \u2018Compassionate Kozhikode\u2019 aims at bringing government agencies and citizens to volunteer to make Kozhikode an inspirational destination for them to live in, and invite others to visit.\n\nTo mark its 50th anniversary, ITB \u2014 the world\u2019s largest travel trade show which has been attracting worldwide attention with 180 participants from five continents since it was first launched in 1966 \u2014 has createdITB50.com, an online portal showcasing leading examples of excellence in tourism from around the world.\n\nCalled \u201850 Destinations, 50 Encounters, 50 Stories\u2019, the project celebrates the most inspiring and innovative examples from tourism around the world.\n\n\u201cTourism has been highlighted and promoted as a powerful tool for development, but \u2018Compassionate Kozhikode\u2019 flips the idea on its head. It starts from the idea that a destination is first and foremost a place where people live. It focuses its efforts on making Kozhikode a better place for its citizens. From this, it naturally follows that it will be a better place for travellers to visit,\u201d said Rika Jean-Francoise, Corporate Social Responsibility Commissioner of ITB Berlin at the ITB50 launch event.\n\nIt is India\u2019s only project to be selected by Berlin\u2019s Internationale Tourismus-B\u00f6rse",
