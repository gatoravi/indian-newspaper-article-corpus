What we are expecting is that Prime Minister Modi will arrive in Israel either this spring or summer and then either the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] or the President [Reuven Rivlin] will come to India in the second part of 2016,\u201d Yael Hashavit, Israel\u2019s Consul-General in Bangalore, said.\n\nIn an interaction with The Hindu \u2019s editors here, Ms. Hashavit, a career diplomat, who has just been posted to India, said India is a \u201cvery important\u201d partner for Israel. \u201cWhen we say that, we mean it. Our Prime Minister has said it several times how important it\u2019s for Israel to work with India, to do business with India and how much India supported Israel. It\u2019s a very open relationship.\u201d\n\nIn October, President Pranab Mukherjee visited Israel, Jordan and Palestine. \u201cThe [Israeli] embassy in Delhi is trying to set the date for Modi to go there and Netanyahu to come here,\u201d said Ms. Hashavit.\n\nNo Indian Prime Minister has visited Israel. The only Israeli Prime Minister who came to India was Ariel Sharon, in 2003.\n\nMs. Hashavit said stronger bilateral cooperation was possible in several areas such as agriculture, water technology and counter-terrorism. \u201cMr. Modi says all the time start up India. Netanyahu says the same thing. He says start up nation.\u201d\n\nThe diplomat said bilateral non-military trade between the two countries now stood at around $4 billion. \u201cThis is a nice number, but can be increased further. There are many fields India and Israel can further strengthen ties. Culturally, India feels comfortable in working with Israel and Israel feels very comfortable with India.\u201d",
