The Tribunal granted AoL three weeks\u2019 time to pay the remaining Rs. 4.75 crore of the compensation.\n\n\u201cThe amount of Rs. 5 crore is being levied as environmental compensation for the restoration amount for biodiversity park and not as penalty,\u2019\u2019 NGT said.\n\nHearing on April 4\n\nIt has also said that if AoL \u201cfails to pay up, then the Tribunal would attach the grant which the Culture Ministry is to release to AoL.\u2019\u2019 The next hearing on the matter would be on April 4.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of the proceedings on Friday, the Tribunal expressed its strong displeasure on the statements in the media by AoL head Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who had allegedly said that \u201che would go to prison but not pay the fine.\u201d Sri Sri had also said that he was not \u201csatisfied\u201d with the verdict of the NGT and would appeal against it.\n\n\u201cIf anybody hurts the image of the Tribunal, we will take it to a logical conclusion as per rule of law. Don\u2019t make the Tribunal a subject of controversy,\u201d the NGT said.\n\nThe AOL informed NGT that it had obtained the certificate of safety from the Delhi Fire Department, while the counsel arguing against the festival sought a ban on the event saying that construction at the venue has been allowed without any risk assessment to the environment.\n\nThe Tribunal's order came on the pleas by NGOs and environmentalists who had sought cancellation of the festival, saying it would seriously endanger the fragile ecosystem on the riverbed.\n\nMore than 35 lakh people are expected to participate in the festival.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \u201cWe need the art of living to follow our dreams, to fight challenges and live for others. This is the Kumbh mela of art and culture; the world is not only connected through economic issues, it can be connected through humanity\u2026 I still recall during my visit to Mongolia, there was an Art of Living centre in that country, and they had organised a reception for me, where there were few Indians, but Mongolians were waving the Indian tricolour,\u201d he said. That was, he added, the importance of soft power in international relations.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s stout defence of the spiritual guru followed similar statements by members of his Cabinet earlier. Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu had dismissed criticism of the WCF, saying, \u201cIt has become a fashion to criticise anything concerned with Hinduism.\u201d\n\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh, facing loud protests in the Rajya Sabha from the opposition over the event, said: \u201cThere is no controversy. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is known for resolving controversial issues.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, often on the opposite side of the political spectrum from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is slated to attend the WCF valedictory on Sunday.",
