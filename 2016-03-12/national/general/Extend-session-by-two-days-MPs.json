    "text": "The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Rajya Sabha, that decides the legislative agenda for the following week of the House met again on Friday, after a stalemate over whether or not the Aadhaar Bill could be considered a money bill.\n\nOn Friday, the issue, however, changed. While the government had its way on upholding the Speaker\u2019s ruling certifying the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill, members of the Opposition said the government may need to extend the session by two days if it wanted to complete the legislative agenda it had presented.\n\n\u201cThis time round, the House has been running smoothly, we have been clearing a Bill a day, but our priority is the General and Railway Budget, for which 18 hours have been allotted. There are only three sittings left [the session is till March 16] and Tuesday has been earmarked for the farewell of retiring Rajya Sabha MPs. Therefore some Opposition parties said the House could be extended by two days to clear the Aadhaar, the Enemy Property Bill, the Child Labour (amendment) Bill and an amendment to the SC/ST Bill,\u201d said a senior MP present at the meeting.",
