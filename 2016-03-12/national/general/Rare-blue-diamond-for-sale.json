The diamond, which is slightly larger than an almond in size, came from South Africa\u2019s Cullinan Mine and was one of 12 displayed at London\u2019s Millennium Dome to mark the year 2000.\n\n\u201cThere are no more than a dozen or so blue diamonds of fancy vivid colour and over 10 carats in the world, so they are very, very rare,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Deputy Chairman for Asia Quek Chin Yeow said.\n\nThe sale will come five months after the 12.03-carat \u201cBlue Moon of Josephine\u201d was bought for a record $48 million in Geneva by an Asian property tycoon \u2014 a further sign the jewellery auction market remains strong despite slowing Chinese growth. The world\u2019s second-largest economy expanded 6.9 per cent in 2015, the worst performance in a quarter of a century and a far cry from years of double-digit increases.\n\n\u201cOf course people are concerned about the China slowdown\u201d Mr. Quek said, but added that sales of rare items seem to be largely unaffected by growth numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s the rarity and the collectability of these wonderful objects. When they come to the market, they will have strong interest from all over the world,\u201d Mr. Quek said. \u2014 AFP",
