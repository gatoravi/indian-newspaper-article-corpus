Today, [Friday] my other family members, including my father, went to meet him at his office in Jagdalpur. But he used abusive words against me and my family. I am being told that my entire family would be destroyed. It\u2019s time for the final battle. I don\u2019t know what will be the consequences, but I have to give up everything in this fight for justice and survival,\u201d she told The Hindu .\n\nSoni Sori, who has emerged as the face of tribal protest in Bastar, addressed a press conference in Raipur in the morning before leaving for Bastar. \u201cI said I suspect the hand of a senior police officer, but now I am more than sure that he was behind it. Why would he otherwise trouble my family? He has been constantly targeting me and my family because we are raising our voice against police atrocities,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she had recovered enough to fight for justice. \u201cI cannot think about my health now. How can a senior police officer abuse me and my father? My father has suffered a lot. He was attacked by Maoists a few years ago. He is 75 and ailing, but the police officer made him cry. If the police don\u2019t release them, my family will stage a protest in front of the police station.\u201d",
