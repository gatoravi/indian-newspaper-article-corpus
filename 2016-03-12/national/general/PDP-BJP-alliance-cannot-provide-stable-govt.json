One who speaks against the Army is not the right man.\u201d\n\nHe praised beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya and said he was \u201ca gentleman, not a crook.\u201d\n\nPraises Mallya\n\n\u201cHe started a very good airline... unfortunately that airline was his greatest failure. Whatever trouble he has today is because of Kingfisher...I\u2019d call him a gentleman , he\u2019s a human being, he\u2019s led a huge company, he went bad like so many people go , but you don\u2019t call them crooks,\u201d he said.",
