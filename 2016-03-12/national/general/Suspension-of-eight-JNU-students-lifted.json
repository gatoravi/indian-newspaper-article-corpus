    "text": "Students refuse to accept the committee report: Kanhaiya\n\nThe high-level Enquiry Committee that was formed to look into the February 9 incident where an event on Afzal Guru was organised on the campus of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), submitted its report to the Vice-Chancellor on Friday and with this, the suspension of eight students stands cancelled.\n\nOut of the eight debarred students, six, who are on the campus will now be able to participate in academic activities from Saturday. However, further action on students will be taken on the basis of the findings of the report. The punishment/action will be decided by the Proctor\u2019s office. This will take a few more days.\n\nThe committee was constituted by the university on February 11 to look into the incident. Following the formation of the committee, eight students \u2014 Kanhaiya Kumar, Rama Naga, Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Anant Prakash, Aishwarya Adhikari and Shweta Raj \u2014 were debarred from academic activities on February 12.\n\nThe committee initially comprised three members \u2014 Prof. Rakesh Bhatnagar, Prof. Himadri Bohidar and Prof. Suman K. Dhar. Two more members were later added to it after students and teachers refused to accept the composition of the committee, citing that the panel had no representative from the SC/ST community or a woman.\n\nAccording to university sources, further action to be taken will be decided on the seriousness of charges that have been found in the inquiry report. \u201cThe quantum of punishment will most likely be at three levels \u2014 some students will be let off with fine, some might have to leave their hostels and some others might be rusticated,\u201d a source in the university said.",
