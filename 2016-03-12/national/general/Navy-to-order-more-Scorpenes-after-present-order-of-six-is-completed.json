Now that is already vacant. We are trying to increase the number of submarines that they are making,\u201d Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said in response to a question in the Lok Sabha.\n\nMDL has six submarines on order which are being built with technology transfer from DCNS of France. After several years delay, Kalvari \u2014 the first of the submarines \u2014 was launched last month and is scheduled to be commissioned by year end after extensive trials. The remaining five, which are in various stages of construction, are expected to be delivered in the next nine months.\n\nWhile Mr. Parrikar had last year hinted about more Scorpenes, this is the first time it was announced in the Parliament. \u201cWe will not let MDL lose the expertise it has gained to licence-build six Scorpene submarines,\u201d he had said.\n\nSpeaking at a separate event, Vice Chief of the Navy Vice Admiral P. Murugesan said the tender for the next line of six submarines to be built in India under Project-75I would be issued once the new Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) is released.\n\n\u201cOnce the revision procedure completes, it will be time to decide which shipyard will manufacture the submarines (P-75I),\u201d Vice Admiral Murugesan said.
