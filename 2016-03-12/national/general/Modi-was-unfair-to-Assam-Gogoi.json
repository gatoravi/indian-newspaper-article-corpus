In fact, I feel pity for him and other leaders of the party from the State. They cannot even open their mouth before Mr. Modi,\u201d Mr. Gogoi said.\n\nHe said the Congress would continue to fight against the BJP\u2019s \u201cdivisive policies and politics of polarisation,\u201d \u201cAt any cost we will not allow Assam\u2019s cultural invasion by the RSS and destroy the prevailing harmony between the different communities,\u201d he said.\n\nBlames Mahanta regime\n\nfor \u2018secret killings\u2019\n\nRaking up the allegations of secret killings during former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta\u2019s tenure, Mr. Gogoi said the alliance between the Asom Gana Parishad and the BJP was \u201copportunistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecret killings during Mr. Mahanta\u2019s rule was a blot on Assam\u2019s history and both the AGP in the State and the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre during that period were equally responsible for the killing of innocent people,\u201d Mr. Gogoi said.\n\n\u201cMahanta is responsible for the secret killings and it could not have been possible without the support of the Central government where the NDA was in power then,\u201d the Chief Minister said.\n\nThe period of Mr. Mahanta\u2019s second term in office and the NDA government at the Centre was the worst phase in Assam\u2019s history \u201cwhen the State bled both in terms of law and order and financially,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gogoi said his government had failed to identify the culprits, but stopped all such killings. \u2014 PTI",
