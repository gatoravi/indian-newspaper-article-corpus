If somebody chooses to call this country India, let him call it India. We will not interfere\u201d, Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur observed.\n\nStating this, the Bench, also comprising Justice U.U. Lalit, dismissed a public interest petition seeking a declaration from the apex court that the republic be called \u201cBharata\u201d instead of India.\n\n\u201cGo file a PIL which is constructive... something which will help us do some good for the poor of this nation... don\u2019t come to us with these emotional issues\u201d, Chief Justice Thakur told social activist Niranjan Bhatwal from Maharashtra.\n\nSays it has no business to dictate or decide what a citizen should\n\ncall his country",
