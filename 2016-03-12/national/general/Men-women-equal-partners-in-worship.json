    "text": "The report presented by RSS general secretary Suresh (Bhaiyyaji) Joshi at the ongoing conclave of the RSS on Friday refers to the controversy over the attempted entry of women into the inner sanctum of a temple in Maharashtra.\n\nSaying that men and women were equal partners in worship since Vedic times, it calls for a change in the mindset where some unfair practices exist, though through consensus and not through politicisation and agitation.\n\nThe report takes note of the growing \u2018communal frenzy\u2019, but cites only Malda, expressing concern over destruction of business establishments of Hindus in attacks.",
