Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar took exception to the statement and termed it \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nStating that SYL was the lifeline of Haryana farmers, Mr. Khattar said he was confident that the State would get every drop of its legitimate share of river waters.\n\nMr. Badal said in the Assembly that not a single drop of water would be allowed to flow out of Punjab. \u201cIn fact, an extremely critical and dangerous water crisis stares its population in the face. I would rather shed every drop of my blood than allow any drop of Punjab\u2019s river waters to flow out,\u201d said Mr. Badal.\n\nThe Haryana government had recently filed a petition in the Supreme Court for an early hearing on the presidential reference in the SYL case which had been pending for the last 12 years.\n\nThe SYL canal, the foundation for which was laid way back in 1982, was to link the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers in Punjab and Haryana, but the project never saw the light of the day as in the 1990s \u2014 amid the rise in terrorism \u2014 water sharing became a sensitive issue.\n\nTerrorists even gunned down officials and workers involved in the construction of the SYL canal in a bid to halt the project.\n\nPunjab should protect the interests of the younger brother, says Khattar",
