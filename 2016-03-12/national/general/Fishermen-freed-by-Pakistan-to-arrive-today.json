They are from various parts of Saurashtra region endowed with long coastline in the State.\n\nHowever, more than 500 fishermen are still languishing in neighbouring country's jails. They have been abducted or held by the Pakistan's Marine Security Agency from International Maritime Boundary Line while on fishing mission. The PMSA patrols the coastline in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cBesides fishermen, as many as 891 boats of Gujarat fishermen are also in the custody of Pakistan authorities because the PMSA also takes away boats,\u201d said Manish Lodhari, secretary of all India fishermen forum, a local advocacy groups working for interests of fishermen in Gujarat.\n\nHe said fishermen in Gujarat suffer hugely because of abduction of boats or fishing trawlers, which are hardly returned.",
