    "text": "What if someone uses emblem of India as a whole, not just a part of it: HC\n\nThe Bombay High Court on Friday sought responses from actor Aamir Khan and Star TV to a public interest litigation plea by an activist that objects to the use of the phrase Satyameva Jayate , the name of their popular TV programme, as it is a part of the emblem of India.\n\nResponding to the petition, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its affidavit said the use of the phrase \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 was not in violation of the State Emblem of India (Prohibition and Improper Use) Act and State Emblem of India (Regulation of Use) Rules.\n\n\u201cThe Act and Rules prohibit improper use of the State Emblem of India as a whole. There is no provision which prohibits the use of its part like Satyameva Jayate , the lion, the bull, the horse and so on. Hence the use of the words \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 in a TV programme does not violate any provision of the Act and Rules,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nThe Division Bench, comprising Justices A.S. Oka and G.S. Kulkarni, however, wanted to know what the Union government\u2019s view would be if someone else uses the Emblem of India as a whole and not just a part of it.\n\nThe Bench directed Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh to appear before it with regard to the petition on April 20. It also directed Star TV and Aamir Khan to file their affidavits by the same date.\n\nIn his petition, activist Manoranjan Roy said Satyameva Jayate is a part of the Emblem of India, and their use for the name of a TV programme violates laws governing its use.",
