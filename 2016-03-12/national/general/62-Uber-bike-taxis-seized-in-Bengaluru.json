    "text": "Bike-taxi operators who ignored the Karnataka Transport Department\u2019s stern warnings got a rude shock on Friday. In a massive undercover operation with check-posts and squads posted in several neighbourhoods, officials seized 62 bike-taxis operated by Uber.\n\nIt was a carefully planned sting operation: Officials roped in 30 volunteers, all private citizens, to book bike-taxis. Once the booking was made and the rider reached the pick-up location, officials seized the two-wheeler and the app booking device. This has come as a blow to Uber, which had announced bike-taxi services in Bengaluru around 10 days after it had introduced it for the first time in Bangkok.\n\n\u201cIf more such bike-taxis are operating in the city, they will be seized and the app devices will be confiscated,\u201d a statement from the Transport Commissioner said.\n\nBut despite the warnings, The Hindu found that the service was still available in some parts of the city on Friday evening.\n\nBike-taxis are being termed illegal because they are private vehicles with white board registration plates being used for commercial purposes.",
