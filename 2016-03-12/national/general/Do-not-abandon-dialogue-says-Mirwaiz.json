    "text": "Amid speculation on Pakistan changing its stand on Kashmir, All Parties Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Friday warned against putting the issue on the back burner.\n\n\u201cNo dialogue between the two countries is going to yield results if there is no headway on the Kashmir issue. Neither India nor Pakistan could afford to put it on the back burner. It will create more distrust and acrimony between the two countries,\u201d Mr. Farooq said in a speech at Jamia Masjid here on Friday.\n\nThe Mirwaiz urged the international community \u201cto persuade both countries to agree to a dialogue on the Kashmir issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe political uncertainty in the subcontinent is because of the Kashmir issue, and it is affecting world peace. It could push the two nuclear powers to a confrontation,\u201d the Mirwaiz said.",
