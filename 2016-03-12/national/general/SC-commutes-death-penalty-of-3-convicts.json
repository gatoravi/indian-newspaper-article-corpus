    "text": "Sixteen years after they torched a bus and burnt to death three college girls while protesting the arrest of the then AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa, the Supreme Court on Friday commuted the death penalty of all three convicts to life imprisonment, saying the incident happened in a flash during mob frenzy and is not pre-meditated.\n\nRolling back its own judgment confirming the death penalty awarded to the three men, the Supreme Court accepted their defence of \u201cdiminished responsibility\u201d and reasoned that the convicts had not even know their victims and their crime did not deserve the death penalty.\n\nA tri-judge Bench, led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi, agreed with defence counsel and senior advocate L. Nageshwar Rao that mobs go berserk and possess a demented sight of what is around them.\n\nThe State of Tamil Nadu, the prosecuting agency in the case, submitted that the Bench should decide the review petition on its merits.",
