She said that over a period of seven years, the situation in India had become \u201cworrisome.\u201d\n\nMs. Lantos-Swett told The Hindu in an interview: \u201cIt is not our mandate to tell India what it should do. But it is our legislative mandate to recommend to the U.S. government what it should do for protecting religious freedoms in various countries.\u201d",
