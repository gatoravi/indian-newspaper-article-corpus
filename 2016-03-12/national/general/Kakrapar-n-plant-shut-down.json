    "text": "The first reactor was commissioned in September 1992 and it started commercial production in May 1993. The second unit was commissioned in January 1995 and began commercial production in September 1995. The second unit has been shut since July 2015 for maintenance. Friday\u2019s incident means that Unit-1 too will be out of action until it gets clearance from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.\n\nShut in 1966 too\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Unit-1 has had problems with its cooling systems. It was shut for 66 days in 1998 owing to a leak in its stator water systems. Since then, however, according to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd, which runs the country\u2019s nuclear power plants, it has been among the country\u2019s best performing plants. Since 2011 it has consistently generated power to at least 95 per cent of its capacity.\n\nA major quake in 2001 near Bhuj did not interrupt the functioning of the plant.\n\n\u2018None exposed to leakage\u2019\n\n\u201cA team of experts from the BARC and another from the Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory are on the way to the plant,\u201d said Surat Collector Rajendra Kumar. \u201cEverything within the plant is under control, nobody has been exposed to the leakage and experts are supervising the plant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to panic , but the magnitude of the coolant system failure is significant.\u201d",
