Previous versions of small lenses were 50 nanometres thick. The lens was created by a team of researchers led by Yuerui \u2018Larry\u2019 Lu from Australian National University (ANU).\n\nScientists said the lens could have revolutionary applications in medicine, science and technology and it could be used to create bendable computer screens.\n\nWhile the new lens has already been used by technology companies with prototype TV and computer screens that can be rolled up or folded, mass production at cheaper costs is yet to be worked out.\n\n\u201cThis type of material is the perfect candidate for future flexible displays,\u201d Mr. Lu said.\n\nAnother application of the Australian-made lens could be arrays of micro-lenses that mimic the compound eyes of insects. Mr. Lu said a crystal of molybdenum disulphide was the special ingredient.\n\nResearchers shaved off layers of the crystal atom by atom to create an object with the domed shape of a lens and the delicate operation used an ion beam, something commonly used in electronics manufacturing. Mr. Lu said manipulating the flow of light at an atomic scale could lead to miniaturisation in the making of cameras. \u2014 PTI\n\nIt is used to make prototype TV and computer screens that can be folded or rolled up",
