    "text": "The Pune police on Thursday issued notices to several students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) for holding Institute Director Prashant Pathrabe hostage in his cabin in August last year.\n\nThe police have identified 18 other students, in addition to the 17 named in the original FIR. Fresh notices were also issued to 12 students who have obtained anticipatory bail. They are to appear in a sessions court in Pune on Monday, when a charge sheet in the case will be filed.\n\nThe FTII Students\u2019 Association (FSA), in a statement, said: \u201cIt is extremely disheartening and shameful to see the administration of a premier government-run institute arm-twisting its students on orders from their superiors, who happen to be the elected representatives of the citizens.\u201d\n\nIt added that Mr. Pathrabe had accused as many as 35 students of preventing him from carrying out his duty of consulting with students and faculty before coming to a decision on assessing the batch of 2008, which is at the centre of a controversy.\n\nPolice issue notices to students for holding director Pathrabe hostage in his cabin last year",
