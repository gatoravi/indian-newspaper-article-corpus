    "text": "The Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Aadhaar Bill, providing statutory backing to the unique identification number for transferring government subsidies and benefits, as a money Bill after the government overruled the Opposition\u2019s objections.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley said thousands of crores of rupees would be saved by plugging leakages and diversions as he rejected the Opposition demand for referring the Bill to a standing committee and their concerns of privacy as well as Aadhaar potentially being used for \u201cmass surveillance\u201d and \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nOverruling the Congress\u2019 objections that the legislation had been turned into a money Bill to avoid voting in the Rajya Sabha where the government did not have a majority, he said Aadhaar was a money Bill in true definition.\n\nThe Bill \u201cwill empower the States to distribute resources to deserving people and save the resources that undeserving people get,\u201d the Minister said while replying to a short debate on the Aadhaar (Target Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016.\n\nEarlier, participating in the debate, Tathagat Satpathy (BJD) said there were fears that the government might use the provisions of the Bill for \u201cmass surveillance\u201d and \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d \u2014 PTI",
