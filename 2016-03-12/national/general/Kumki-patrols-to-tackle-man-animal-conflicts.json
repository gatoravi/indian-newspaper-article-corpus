Kunju is a tusker and Pramugha a makhana elephant brought from Karnataka recently.\n\n\u201cWe started the elephant patrolling in the Thottamoola and Valamvayal areas in the Muthanga range of forests four days ago and it was a huge success,\u201d warden P. Dhaneshkumar said.\n\nThe Kumkis are trained to scare away wild pachyderms into the forest, either by using their trunk or tusks.\n\n\u201cWe have constituted two teams for the purpose and they would be deployed in areas where wild animals pose a serious threat to the life and property of people,\u201d Mr. Dhaneshkumar said.\n\nEach group comprises seven to eight members, including a forester, two forest beat officers, two or three anti-poaching tribal watchers and mahouts.\n\nThe Wayanad sanctuary is using\n\na squad of trained elephants to assist in the operation",
