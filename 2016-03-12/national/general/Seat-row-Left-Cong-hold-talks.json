    "text": "In an attempt to iron out differences that have cropped over nominating candidates, senior leaders of the Left Front and the Congress held a meeting late on Friday evening at the office of Ganashakti, the organ of Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n\nThose present at the meeting included Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and former State Congress president Pradip Bhattacharya and senior Congress leaders Somendra Nath Mitra and Abdul Mannan. Mr. Bhattacharya was one of the key negotiators and reacted strongly on Thursday after the Left announced its second list. The Left Front put up candidates in over 12 seats on Thursday where Congress had decided to contest earlier.\n\nFollowing the Left's announcement of candidates in Congress' bastion, Mr. Bhattacharya told The Hindu that the decision was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and indicated that the alliance might collapse. However, things started changing from Friday as the senior leaders of the Left Front indicated that a fresh round of negotiation was possible.\n\nCPI(M)'s Central Committee member Shyamal Chakraborty said that if it becomes evident that Trinamool Congress will gain from the friendly fights between the Congress and the Left, then the candidates may \u201cwithdraw nomination.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Friday leaders of both the parties expressed hope that the bottlenecks in certain seats would be addressed. State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: \u201ctension that has cropped up will be resolved\u201d through discussions.",
