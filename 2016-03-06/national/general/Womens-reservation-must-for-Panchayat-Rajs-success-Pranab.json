Moorthy\n\nPresident Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday appealed to all political parties to pass the Constitution 108th Amendment Bill, or Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, to reserve one-third of the seats in State legislatures and Parliament for women.\n\nAddressing a national conference on \u201cWomen legislators: building a resurgent India\u201d, organised by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan here to coincide with International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, he said this reservation would be the natural fulfilment of the ideals behind the Panchayati Raj Act.\n\n\u201cDuring my days in Parliament \u2014 and my colleague from then, Mrs. Sushma Swaraj, is present here \u2014 there had been big attempts at getting the legislation cleared. It was cleared in the Rajya Sabha, but not in the Lok Sabha. There has to be an attitudinal change and I am hopeful that the Bill will come up for consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mukherjee said Vice-President Hamid Ansari\u2019s suggestion that political parties make a start by giving at least 33 per cent of the electoral ticket to women candidates was a good one, but \u201cunless it is followed by all parties it won\u2019t be successful\u201d. He added, however, that the Vice-President\u2019s suggestion that political parties take particular care in making sure they nominated women members to parliamentary committees was an important one.\n\nHe praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the conference, but did not speak. \u201cAs soon as he was elected Prime Minister, he gave the slogan of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao , and the fact that he is here, when he does not have to speak, for this function, shows his commitment to women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d the President said.\n\nMs. Mahajan said the conference was important in underlining the fact that economic growth was not the only measure of holistic development \u2014 there should be commensurate social development.\n\n\u201cThat cannot happen without the contribution of women legislators and administrators,\u201d she said. The conference will continue on Sunday.",
