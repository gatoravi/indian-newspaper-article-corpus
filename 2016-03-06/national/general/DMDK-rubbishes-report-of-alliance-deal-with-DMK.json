Stalin dismissed such reports and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar went back to New Delhi empty-handed after his attempts to meet party president Vijayakant failed.\n\nAn official statement issued by party propaganda secretary V. C. Chandhrakumar said imaginary stories about alliances involving the DMDK were being spread wantonly by some.\n\n\u201cIn this manner, it is being said the party has struck a deal with an outfit for 59 seats and was in secret negotiations with another one and that several crores of rupees have been exchanged.\n\nStories are being spread that party leader Vijayakant was keeping silent to increase his bargain,\u201d the statement pointed out.\n\nMr. Chandhrakumar said till this moment Mr. Vijayakant had not held alliance discussions with any party. \u201cAs far as the DMDK is concerned, only the decision made by Mr. Vijayakant is true and official,\u201d he added.\n\nThe whip of the party in the Assembly said Mr. Vijayakant had been guiding the party since 2005 and had strengthened it manifold.\n\nParty spokesperson Chandhrakumar says Vijayakant\n\nhas not held talks with anyone",
