Ram, Chairman, Kasturi and Sons Ltd., on Saturday.\n\nHe was speaking at the first day of the two-day Mumbai Collective event, \u201cCelebrating Freedom and Pluralism in Defence of Secularism\u201d at the Y.B. Chavan Centre. The event started with an inaugural address by Professor R. Ramkumar of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.\n\nThe Mumbai Collective represents a group of academics, activists, writers and journalists with a view \u2018to bringing like-minded progressive people from different walks of life\u2019 together.\n\nThe inaugural panel, comprising Mr. Ram and Professor Gopal Guru of the Centre of Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, spoke about restricted freedom of speech and nationalism respectively. Mr. Ram noted that the slew of incidents in recent months were not merely \u201caccidental\u201d but clearly had a pattern in adherence to an ideology. But he refused to believe that this was the age of fascism.\n\nTalking on nationalism and its state in India, Professor Guru said: \u201cNationalism isn\u2019t sufficiently plural. The dominant definition is emotional, outward looking, and based on borders such as the Line of Control.\u201d\n\nA panel discussion, \u2018Mumbai: 24 years after the 1992 riots\u2019 with Naresh Feranandes, Editor, Scroll.in , and Jyoti Punwani, independent journalist, talked about the increase in \u2018ghettoisation\u2019 in the city post-1992 riots.\n\n\u201cA historian\u2019s dharma is to be vigilant to mythmaking,\u201d said historian K.M. Shrimali as he spoke about \u2018How the Sangh Parivar Rewrites History.\u2019 Mr. Shrimali recounted several anecdotes of how the Sangh Parivar had sought to establish its own version of history in educational institutions.\n\nHistory and facts played a significant role in another panel which sought to argue against the Hindutva appropriation of icons such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Shivaji and Bhagat Singh. Chaman Lal, Professor of Indian languages at JNU, and an expert on Bhagat Singh, marvelled at how the freedom fighter has been appropriated as an icon by the Sangh Parivar. Bhagat Singh was, in fact, a prominent Marxist atheist. While CPI(M) member Ashok Dhawale sought to debunk the saffronised version of Shivaji and talked about his progressive tolerance of Muslims, former MP Prakash Ambedkar highlighted the ideological differences between the Sangh Parivar and Dr. Ambedkar\u2019s philosophy.\n\nMedia and the crisis\n\nThe last panel discussion for the day was \u2018Media and Communal Politics\u2019 with journalists Nikhil Wagle, P. Sainath, Sashi Kumar, and Geeta Seshu.\n\nWhile Ms Seshu spoke about the failure of the media to regulate itself, Mr. Wagle opposed the manipulation of the media for communal gains. \u201cThese are the worst days in my 35 years of journalism because so much poison exists now,\u201d Mr. Wagle said. \u201cIf you want to break democracy, secularism, and fraternity, you have to break the media first,\u201d said Mr. Wagle. Sashi Kumar, the founder of Asianet and chairman of the Asian College of Journalism, said the job of free and truthful journalism is to \u201ccomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\u201d.\n\nMr. Sainath said the more the Indian population had become heterogeneous, the more the media was becoming homogenous with the corporatisation of the media. \u201cWe have reduced journalism to a revenue stream,\u201d Mr. Sainath said, as he called the Indian media politically free but imprisoned by profit. He noted how the greatest exposures in journalism in the last decade had come not from mainstream journalists but people such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning.\n\n(The author is a freelance writer)\n\nThe Mumbai Collective seeks to bring together\n\nlike-minded progressive people",
