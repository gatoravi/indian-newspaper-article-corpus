Rather, it will be the first step towards making the Rajya Sabha redundant in the days to come,\u201d Mr Azad said. \u201cI am sure, like me, you would not like to fiddle with the constitutional structure that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThe Opposition parties protested when the Bill was introduced on Thursday as a money Bill.\n\nM.R. Madhavan of the PRS Legislative Research says serious questions can be raised on whether the Bill falls in the category of a money Bill. \u201cWhat does the Constitution say? It says money Bills should have certain features: one, tax is levied through the Bill or some expenditure is validated through the Consolidated Fund of India. It also says anything incidental to these two provisions can put a Bill in the category of a money bill,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe way the Aadhaar Bill has been positioned is through clause 7 of the Bill that essentially says the Bill will enable the government to mandate the use of Aadhaar to distribute subsidy. In clause 57, however, it says one can also use this identification number for any other function \u2026 In this way, it does not meet the criteria of a money bill,\u201d Mr Madhavan said.\n\nWhat is giving the Opposition the jitters is that as part of the Finance Bill, the government has mentioned the incorporation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monetary policy committee. \u201cHow can that be made a part of the Finance Bill? It is just to avoid scrutiny by the Rajya Sabha,\u201d a source said.",
