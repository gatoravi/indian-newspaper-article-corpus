The PDP and the BJP, have failed to make any headway to stake claim for the government formation after the demise of CM Mufti Muhammad Sayeed on January 7.\n\nSeveral PDP leaders told The Hindu that \u201cthey await the Centre\u2019s move on issues discussed by Mr. Drabu with the BJP leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see any concrete measures on the ground,\u201d PDP legislator and spokesman Nayeem Akhtar said.",
