He said history was replete with instances of this kind. \u201cThis is what happened to Basavanna in the 12th century, and Gandhiji and Ambedkar in the 20th century. Champion of backward classes D. Devaraj Urs suffered because of his concern for the backward classes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI did not become Chief Minister overnight. I know how difficult it is for a backward class leader to become the Chief Minister and I also know the fact that it is equally difficult to be in power,\u201d Mr. Siddaramaiah said, indirectly attacking those allegedly trying to destabilise his government.\n\nHe said he did not have a single black mark in his political career.\n\nNoting that society would not benefit by attacking the private life of any person, he said, \u201cIf a leader worked against the interest of society, that should be brought to the public notice with the support of facts, figures and documents.\u201d\n\nHe accused Opposition of trying to tarnish his image; refutes BJP charge of govt. being inactive",
