    "text": "Following the transfer of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh\u2019s petition in the disproportionate assets case to the Delhi High Court, the Central Bureau of Investigation has sought vacation of an interim order restraining the investigating agency from arresting or interrogating him.\n\nThe stay order was granted earlier by Himachal Pradesh High Court on Mr. Singh\u2019s plea seeking quashing of the first information report registered against him.\n\nThe CBI told the Bench that the probe in the case was held up because of the stay. On the other hand, Mr. Singh has claimed that the CBI had overstepped its jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the CBI moved the Supreme Court, the apex court transferred Mr. Singh\u2019s petition from Himachal Pradesh to Delhi on November 5 last year, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.\n\nThe FIR against Mr. Singh has been registered in Delhi under Sections 13(1)(e) and 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 109 of Indian Penal Code.",
