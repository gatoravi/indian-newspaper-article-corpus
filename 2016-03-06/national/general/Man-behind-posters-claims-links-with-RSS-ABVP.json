    "text": "Posters announcing a reward of Rs. 11 lakh for anyone shooting JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar dead were put up on the walls of some prominent establishments in New Delhi such as the Press Club of India and the National Media Centre and near the BJP and Congress offices.\n\nAdarsh Sharma, president of the little-known Purvanchal Sena, made no efforts to conceal the fact that he was the man behind the posters, which carried his name and phone number. He also posed with a poster in front of journalists. Speaking to The Hindu , Sharma claimed a long association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.\n\nA case under the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act has been filed against him at the Parliament Street police station. It attracts one year in jail or Rs. 50,000 in fine or both.",
