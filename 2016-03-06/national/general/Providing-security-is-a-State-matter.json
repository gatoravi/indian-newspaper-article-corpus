    "text": "BCCI secretary and BJP MP Anurag Thakur has countered Pakistan\u2019s demand for a guarantee from the government for security of its cricket team.\n\nHe said providing security to the visiting cricket teams was a State matter. \u201cThe International Cricket Council, BCCI and the respective State governments are responsible for the security of the match and the players,\u201d he said. Pakistan has been seeking strong assurances after veterans of the armed forces in Himachal Pradesh threatened to interrupt the India-Pakistan match in Dharamshala. The Pakistan Cricket Board, its spokesperson Amjad Bhatti said, took note of the comments by Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh that the match should not be held as the Pathankot terror attack had created a negative sentiment about cricket with Pakistan among the fans and the war veterans of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\u201cVirbhadra Singh\u2019s comments surprised us as he belongs to the Congress. The PCB has been humiliated once in the recent past after it agreed to hold the bilateral series following a secret meeting between BCCI and PCB representatives in Dubai. The PCB cannot take chance over the safety and security of Pakistan players,\u201d political commentator Fawwad Chaudhary told The Hindu from Lahore.",
