Anti-national slogans are being cloaked as freedom of speech. Slogans such as Bharat tere tukde honge inshallah inshallah ... Bharat ki barbadi tak ... Afzal hum sharminda hai ... are being raised. And Rahul Gandhi goes there [JNU] and says they [students] should be allowed to speak and be heard, that they have freedom of speech. Do you consider it freedom of speech,\u201d Mr. Shah asked.\n\nTargeting Mr. Gandhi, who had extended support to the JNU students and visited the campus, Mr. Shah said, \u201cPerhaps, Rahul Gandhi ji does not know that the youth is willing to sacrifice their life for a single inch of the country.\u201d",
