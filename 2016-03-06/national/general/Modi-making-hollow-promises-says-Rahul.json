Did I say anything personal? Modi ji , in his hour-long speech, instead of giving a reply to these questions, quoted former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and launched a personal attack on me,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said at the election meeting.\n\n\u201cHe does not give answers, but only makes promises which are hollow,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the JNU row, he said the government slapped sedition charges on JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and put him in jail. \u201cBut I listened to his 20-minute speech and there is not a single word against the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople were lured by Modi\u2019s false and hollow promises and are asking for a refund now,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI",
