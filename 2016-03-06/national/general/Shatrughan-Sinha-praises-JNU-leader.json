Mr. Sinha dubbed Mr. Kumar as a \u201cson of Bihar.\u201d\n\nHe said the student leader proved that he had potential. Earlier, Mr. Sinha had expressed happiness when Mr. Kumar was granted bail by the Delhi High Court. Unlike most BJP leaders, Mr. Sinha said there was nothing wrong if Kanhaiya demanded azadi (freedom) from poverty, casteism and hunger, besides his stand on freedom of expression under the rights provided by the Constitution. \u2014 IANS",
