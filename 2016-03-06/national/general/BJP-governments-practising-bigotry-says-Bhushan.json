Looking at how the BJP is deliberately targeting dissenters, the situation is turning out to be worse than Emergency. Over a month and a half after Meena beat up activists during a j awabdehi (accountability) yatra (in Rajasthan), he remains free. Then there are Ministers like Katheria, but no action is being taken against such people,\u201d Mr. Bhushan said.",
