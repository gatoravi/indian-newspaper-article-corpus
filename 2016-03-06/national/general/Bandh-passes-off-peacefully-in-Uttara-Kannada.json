While Muslims responded to the Tanzeem\u2019s call in most of the towns, its impact was felt more in Bhatkal, a communally-sensitive town with a Muslim majority. The town wore a deserted as people even refrained from venturing out of their homes. However, life was normal in the non-Muslim dominated areas, where commercial and other establishments functioned as usual.\n\nBhatkal Deputy Superintendent of Police Anoop Shetty told The Hindu that no untoward incident was reported anywhere in the town. However, life in Muslim-dominated areas was paralysed as all business establishments remained closed. Even the government offices functioned and examinations in schools and colleges went off smoothly. Mr. Shetty said that the additional security arrangement in place would continue for a few more days.",
