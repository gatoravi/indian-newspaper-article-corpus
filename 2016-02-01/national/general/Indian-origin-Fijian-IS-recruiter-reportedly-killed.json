    "text": "An Indian-origin Fijian, who is Australia\u2019s most wanted Islamic State terror recruiter, has reportedly been killed in Syria, according to media reports on Sunday.\n\nThe report of Neil Prakash\u2019s death, a Melbourne-born radical, was posted on secure communications app Telegram, quoting an IS member.\n\nThe IS claims Prakash, also known as Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, has been \u201cshahada\u201d \u2014 the terror group\u2019s description when a fighter is killed. No details have yet emerged of how or where he reportedly died, Herald Sun reported.\n\nThe terrorist, who allegedly had contact with some of those accused of plotting an Anzac Day terror attack in Victoria, flew to Syria in 2013, the report said.\n\nAnzac Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand that commemorates those who served and died in wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations.\n\nUntil recently Prakash had used social media to groom potential terror recruits, but was forced to change his communication methods because of concerns he would be tracked by countries fighting the IS. The Federal government and the police sources were on Saturday night unable to confirm Prakash\u2019s death, which would hurt the terror group\u2019s international recruitment efforts, the report said. \u2014 PTI",
