We are just responding to the political propaganda,\u201d Mr. Hussain told The Hindu . \u201cFor us, as the Prime Minister said, Rohith Vemula was a son of Mother India.\u201d\n\nPolitical parties are generally not keen to take a line contrary to the dominant public discourse on an issue seen as related to Dalit sensitivities, and the hardening of the BJP\u2019s line is surprising observers. Some Dalit leaders within the BJP had also been uneasy with the party\u2019s bid to brazen it out after Mr. Vemula\u2019s death.\n\nThe party defended Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya\u2019s letter to Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani and the HRD Ministry\u2019s missives to the Hyderabad University as routine official letters on complaints.\n\nBJP insiders explain that the party sees the controversy as part of a sustained attempt to malign the government by painting it as either anti-minority or anti-Dalit. \u201cThere is a conspiracy to malign the government on issues that have nothing to do with the Centre,\u201d BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma told The Hindu . \u201cFrom the fake campaign around Church attacks, to the returning of awards, to the death of this student, there is a conspiracy to allege a BJP design in everything wrong. While we are saddened by the student\u2019s death, we strongly disapprove of attempts to politicise it.\u201d",
