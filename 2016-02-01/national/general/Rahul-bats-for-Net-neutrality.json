    "text": "Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged that the Modi-government was delaying framing of policy on the controversial issue of Net neutrality under the \u201cpretext of repeated discussions,\u201d while also slamming it for \u201clooking the other way\u201d when operators introduced price differential through zero-rating plans. Mr. Gandhi said in a statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018Digital India\u2019 scheme could not become a \u201ceuphemism for an Internet controlled by large remote corporations.\u201d\n\nAsserting that the Congress always stood for \u2018Freedom of the Internet\u2019 and \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019, he said the service providers and the government should treat all data equally. \u201cInternet users should be free to connect to any website or service that they want, enabling a level playing field on the \u2018world wide web.\u2019 We recognise the danger of privileging a private platform over a public Internet introducing a new digital divide,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cTelecom Regulatory Authority of India [TRAI] has issued consultation papers on the issue twice over, covering similar questions for consumers to answer on Net Neutrality, free basics and data price differentiation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gandhi said that despite industry body Nasscom, over 500 start-up entrepreneurs and the young in India demanding Net neutrality, the government had been delaying a clear-cut policy on this.\n\n\u201cDigital India should mean Internet connectivity as a public utility, open-ended and generative. With Digital India, people would get more access to the Internet \u2014 the whole internet \u2014 and not primarily a filter on the web,\u201d he said. Mr. Gandhi\u2019s statement is an attempt to recast the Opposition vs. government face-off in terms of the multinational \u201chaves\u201d versus the Open Source \u201chave-nots.\u201d\n\nThe Congress\n\nvice-president says the party always stood for freedom of the Internet",
