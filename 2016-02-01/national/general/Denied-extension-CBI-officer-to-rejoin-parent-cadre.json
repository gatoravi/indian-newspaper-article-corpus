    "text": "CBI Joint Director Su. Arunachalam, who is heading the agency\u2019s anti-corruption, economic offences and special crimes branches in the Southern States, has written to the CBI Director seeking to relieve him of his responsibilities as the State refused to extend his deputation.\n\nThis is the second time that the 1983-batch IPS officer has sought to be relieved from the Central agency on similar grounds.\n\nWhile an IPS officer on deputation is allowed to stay on for seven years in the CBI, the parent cadre\u2019s (the State government) approval is sought for extension on the completion of the fifth year. In the case of Mr. Arunachalam, who is in the rank of an Inspector-General of Police, police sources said the Ministry of Home Affairs had written to the Tamil Nadu government in February 2015 seeking approval to extend his deputation for two years. Awaiting response, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet and the Central Vigilance Commission approved his tenure till June 30, 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, the State government replied to the MHA refusing to spare the services of the officer for deputation. A copy of the communication was also marked to the Joint Director.\n\nDespite the officer writing to the CBI headquarters that he should be relieved since the State government had not given consent to his extension, the Government of India insisted that he continued till an alternative arrangement was made.\n\nHe is handling high profile cases including Bellary mining scam",
