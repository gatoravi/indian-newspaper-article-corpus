    "text": "The Prime Minister seeks to push khadi to revive the Mahatma\u2019s legacy\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asked people to observe a two minutes\u2019 silence on every January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n\u201cIf the entire nation observes silence every January 30 at 11 a.m., you can imagine the energy that a single moment will generate. It should be made a practice,\u201d Mr. Modi said in his first Mann Ki Baat address this year.\n\nEven as he made no specific mention of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, seen as a right-wing fanatic, Mr. Modi sought to push khadi to revive Gandhian legacy.\n\nJob generation\n\n\u201cKhadi has the power to provide employment to crores of people. It has now become a symbol and a centre of interest of the nation\u2019s youth,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\n\n\u201cSardar Patel said India\u2019s independence is in khadi , India\u2019s civilisation represents khadi , farmers\u2019 welfare is in khadi ,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDue to the efforts of many government organisations in the field of khadi , around 18 lakh people can be granted employment,\u201d he said, calling upon people to have at least one piece of garment made of khadi in their wardrobe.\n\nGirls\u2019 education\n\nMr. Modi lauded Haryana and Gujarat for their initiative to make educated girls hoist the Tricolour, saying this would give a boost to the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao initiative.\n\nIncidentally, while Haryana has been a laggard in sex ratio, Gujarat\u2019s sex ratio has declined in the last census.\n\nMr. Modi said he sensed immense energy among youth to set up start-ups, saying start-ups were not just about the IT sector but could involve any sphere of economic activity.",
