The film echoes experiences across the institutions that offer prestige along with degrees.\u201d\n\nThe clandestine manner in which Placebo was made can be a subject of film-making in itself. The making commenced when the 25-year-old sibling of Abhay Kumar smashed his right hand in a glass window during a fight on the AIIMS campus. Following that, Abhay Kumar lived secretly on the medical college campus for two years to do the film. He smuggled himself and his hand-held camera into the hostel. His film is based on extensive interviews with four students, including his brother. The documentary has faced no problem so far and has got an overwhelming response at various film festivals. Because of the increase in pressure from parents, those who join prestigious institutions start suffering from anxiety. They start feeling inferior as they cannot compete in the \u201crat race,\u201d Ms. Phadke said.",
