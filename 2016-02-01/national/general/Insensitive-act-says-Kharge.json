Mallikarjun Kharge has termed the imposition of President\u2019s rule in Arunachal Pradesh insensitive and anti-constitutional.\n\nTalking to presspersons here on Sunday, Mr. Kharge said it was a serious threat to democracy. He accused Governor J.P. Rajkhowa of engineering a Constitutional crisis in the State using trumped-up charges against a democratically elected government. Charging the Governor with acting at the instance of the Central government, Mr. Kharge said he should be recalled.\n\nHe questioned the holding of the Assembly session in a makeshift hall to remove the Speaker and moving a no-confidence motion against Chief Minister Nabam Tuki. The BJP had no faith in the Constitution and its values.",
