    "text": "The inquiry committee, set up by Uttarakhand government to examine the infertility medicine produced by Ramdev\u2019s pharmacy, has submitted its report which is \u201cnot in favour\u201d of the Yoga Guru. The State government had formed the three-member committee last year to probe \u2018Putrajeevak Beej\u2019, an Ayurvedic product which allegedly promises a male child.\n\nThe report has been sent to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat and will be submitted to the Union government after he gives the go ahead, State\u2019s Principal Secretary, Health, Om Prakash, said.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry report is not in favour of Ramdev. It has been sent to the Chief Minister,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.\n\nThe product courted controversy when Rajya Sabha MPs, led by JD (U)\u2019s K.C. Tyagi, demanded a ban on it and sought stringent action against the manufacturer.\n\nThe Centre had then directed the State to launch an inquiry into it. However, Ramdev had rejected the allegations, saying the medicine helps in curing infertility in women and termed as \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d reports that it promises a male child.\n\nThe committee, which was earlier headed by AYUSH Drug Controller P.D. Chamoli, however, gave a clean chit to Ramdev, saying that the nomenclature of the drug was in accordance with the ancient Ayurvedic books and literature. \u2014 PTI",
