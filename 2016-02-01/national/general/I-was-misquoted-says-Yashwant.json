    "text": "Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha denied on Sunday that he had compared the Narendra Modi government with the Emergency regime of Indira Gandhi.\n\n\u201cWhen some people referred to some cases of intolerance, I reminded them of the imposition of the emergency by Indira Gandhi and I said that people of this country taught her a lesson in 1977, because it is not in our spirit to be intolerant. It is not in our spirit to stifle dialogue, and therefore both democracy and dialogue are alive. That is what I said,\u201d Mr. Sinha said on Sunday, referring to his remarks a day earlier in Goa. \u201cThe people will consign him to the dust, you just have to wait for the next elections,\u201d Mr. Sinha reportedly said without naming Mr. Modi.",
