What\u2019s wrong in it [Mr. Prasad\u2019s action]? Lalu ji is the leader of our Mahagathbandhan [the Grand Alliance], which is in power, and why shouldn\u2019t he call up officials if someone approaches him with their problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t your local representatives call up local officials when you go to them with your problems,\u201d Mr. Kumar asked, in defence of Mr. Prasad, who was present on the dais. Mr. Yadav\u2019s sons \u2014 Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav and Health Minister Tej Pratap \u2014 were among those present.\n\nThe alliance partners slammed the Opposition BJP for \u201cplaying politics\u201d over the construction of the river bridge, saying \u201cthey believe in publicity but we believe in work\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis river bridge will be completed by 2020 and it will herald the development of the riverine area. Let the BJP thump their chest but we\u2019ll do what we have promised you all,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.\n\nEarlier, in connection with the appearance of the RJD chief\u2019s name in a newspaper advertisement for the proposed mega bridge, State BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had asked the government, \u201cIn what capacity does Lalu Prasad\u2019s name figure in government advertisements?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe [Mr. Prasad] was convicted in a corruption case, and also he is neither an MP nor an MLA. He does not even hold a constitutional post,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\nOf late, Opposition leaders in Bihar have been describing Mr. Prasad as the \u201csuper CM of Bihar who has actually been running the government from behind the curtain\u201d.\n\nHowever, his sons as well as leaders of both the ruling parties \u2014 JD(U) and RJD \u2014 have been defending Mr. Prasad\u2019s as \u201cthe leader of the coalition government\u201d.\n\nSignificantly, Mr. Kumar laid the foundation stone for the proposed river bridge last year.\n\nThe estimated construction cost is Rs. 5,000 crore, out of which Rs. 3,000 crore will come from the Asian Development Bank and the remainder financed by the State government.",
