Sudershan\n\nMinisters and Aam Aadmi Party MLAs along with party men armed with brooms cleaned the streets on Sunday even as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) sanitation workers\u2019 strike entered day five. A sanitation drive was launched in all the AAP constituencies and garbage was removed.\n\nThe sanitation workers on their part continued with their strike and the vociferous protestors warned the AAP government that if their demands, which include clearing their dues and regularisation, were not looked into, the garbage situation in the city was likely to \u2018deteriorate\u2019 in the coming days.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also carried out the cleaning drive in his constituency, Patparganj, said \u201cwe have already disbursed all the funds to municipal corporations for paying the salaries of their staff. We cannot let people live amid garbage. Hence, we have undertaken the cleanliness drive.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,000 Delhi Jal Board workers have teamed up with the PWD workers for the cleanliness drive and 123 machines including auto tippers, maintenance vans and JCB, were deployed on Sunday.\n\nThe protesting safai karamcharis clashed with the PWD teams, who had been pressed into cleaning the roads. The PWD officials said at some places, like Laxmi Nagar, Uttam Nagar, attempts were made to stall the cleaning work. \u201cBut after reporting these incidents to the police, cleaning work started,\u201d said a government spokesperson.\n\nThe Delhi government last week announced auditing of the corporations\u2019 accounts but the BJP-led civic agencies turned down the proposal. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the Delhi government to audit the accounts. They have clearly said that only the Home Ministry can audit their accounts. But they aren\u2019t asking for grant from the Centre,\u201d said Mr. Sisodia.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that AAP MLAs took up the cleaning work after sanitation workers went on strike. Last year in March, June and October, the safai karamcharis dumped garbage on the roads as a mark of protest. Then also the AAP MLAs cleaned the streets.",
