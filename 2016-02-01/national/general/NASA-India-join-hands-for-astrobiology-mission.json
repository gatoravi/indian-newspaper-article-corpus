India now has an orbiter that's still circling Mars and taking pictures \u2014 with five instruments on board \u2014 in hopes of finding methane, carbon dioxide and the effect of solar winds on its surface. \u201cLadakh has been studied before but this time we\u2019re going to be looking at some very specific experiments,\u201d said Mr. Pandey \u2014 an engineer from India and who\u2019s previously worked at the NASA. \u201cWe will be testing a rover that will collect samples and analyse some of the high altitude springs etc.\u201d\n\nAccording to the programme\u2019s website, Ladakh offers a \u201chigh UV (ultra-violet) exposed, dry ecosystem with Mars analogue topological features that tell us heaps about the origin and evolution of our planet\u2019s topological features\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore its Mars Mission, the ISRO has Chandrayaan 2 planned to the moon, in 2017, that too hopes to set a lander on the surface of the moon.\n\nThe Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, which has expertise in studying ancient climate and life, will be coordinating the travel of scientists and researchers from several countries who will be part of the 10-day expedition.\n\nAlong with research experiments, the group would also meet school students and organise sessions on how astrobiology missions work, the evolution of life on earth as well as on how space missions work, Mr. Pandey added.",
