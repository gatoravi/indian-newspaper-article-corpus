Go here to watch it. We hope you like it.\u201d\n\nLouis C.K. wrote, directed and stars in the show, whose cast also includes Alan Alda, Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Rebecca Hall, Jessica Lange, Kurt Metzger and Steven Wright, among others.\n\nThe theme song is by Paul Simon.\n\nThe episode, a 67-minute drama flecked with dark humour, is set primarily in a bar run by Horace, played by Louis C.K., and Pete, played by Buscemi. Alda plays the dyspeptic, pre-politically correct Uncle Pete, who tends bar.\n\nDiverse subjects\n\nThe plot \u2014 which involves what will become of the bar a year after the death of its patriarch, Horace\u2019s father \u2014 touches on evergreen themes of inter-generational and family conflict, though the dialogue includes discussions of topical events. \u2014 New York Times News Service",
