    "text": "Wanglin Lowangdong, a rebel Congress MLA from Arunachal Pradesh, said that on the advice of Congress general secretary V. Narayanasamy, the dissident leaders wrote to president Sonia Gandhi, citing the reasons for their protest and seeking an appointment with her. \u201cThe letter was delivered to Ms. Gandhi in the first week of November. We are still waiting to hear back from her.\u201d\n\nThe rebel leaders said they would like to continue working for the Congress even if the senior leadership kept snubbing them. \u201cWe are not against our party, we are against the dictatorship of [former Chief Minister Nabam] Tuki,\u201d Mr. Lowangdong said.\n\nMr. Narayanansamy confirmed to The Hindu that the rebel leaders sought appointments with Ms. Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Yet he maintained that there was no need for them to meet the rebel leaders. \u201cI have been meeting them [the rebels] every now and then,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if Soniaji or Rahulji want to meet them, they will call them.\u201d\n\nLast Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard the petition filed by Mr. Tuki challenging the imposition of President\u2019s rule. The court sought the response of the Centre and Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa.",
