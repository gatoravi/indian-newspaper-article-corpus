    "text": "A U.K. website set up to catalogue the last days of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on Sunday claimed that his gold-plated tooth is likely to be found in his last remains held at Renkoji Temple in Tokyo. Bose\u2019s trusted aide de camp Colonel Habibur Rehman, who was involved in the same air crash that is believed to have killed Bose in Taiwan on August 18, 1945, had told his son he had dropped the tooth in the urn containing Netaji\u2019s ashes when he went to collect the remains after the cremation.\n\nIt had apparently been extracted before the body entered the furnace and given to him by one of the officials associated with the last rites, www.bosefil-es.info claimed on Sunday.\n\nThe Netaji Papers declassified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 23 confirm that the creator of the website, Ashis Ray, brought the matter to the attention of the former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Leader of the Opposition Atal Bihari Vajpayee and West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, among other Indian political leaders in 1995. \u2014 PTI",
