    "text": "A Bangladeshi father dubbed \u2018Tree Man\u2019 for massive bark-like warts on his hands and feet will finally have surgery to remove the growths that first began appearing 10 years ago, a hospital said on Sunday.\n\nAbul Bajandar, from the southern district of Khulna, was undergoing preparations for the surgery to cut out the growths weighing at least five kg that have smothered his hands and feet.\n\n\u201cInitially, I thought that they\u2019re harmless,\u201d the 26-year-old said at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH).\n\n\u201cBut slowly I lost all my ability to work. There are now dozens of two to three inch roots in both my hands. And there are some small ones in my legs,\u201d said Mr. Bajandar who was forced to quit working as a bicycle puller.\n\nA team of doctors has been formed to perform the operation at DMCH, Bangladesh\u2019s largest state-run hospital, which has decided to waive costs of the treatment.\n\nTests are underway to ensure Mr. Bajandar\u2019s root-like warts can be removed surgically without damaging major nerves or causing any other health problems.\n\nThe massive warts, which first started appearing when he was a teenager but began spreading rapidly four years ago, have been diagnosed as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic skin disease that makes the person susceptible to skin growths. \u2014 AFP\n\nThe warts, which have smothered Abul Bajandar\u2019s hands and feet, weigh at least 5kg",
