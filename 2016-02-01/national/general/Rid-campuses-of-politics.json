Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday held the Congress responsible for \u201cpolitics on campuses\u201d in general, citing its vice-president Rahul Gandhi\u2019s participation at a fast by students at the University of Hyderabad on Saturday against the suicide of research scholar Rohith Vemula.\n\nAddressing a meeting of the Uttara Bharatiya Manch, a body representing those from north India living in the city, he said Rohith Vemula was not the first to commit suicide on the campus of a higher education institution. \u201cThere are 10 others who died over the years on the campuses across the country, but you did not visit [them],\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Gandhi\u2019s two visits to the university in a fortnight.\n\n\u201cWhat is required is preventive, corrective and appropriate action for the atmosphere on the campuses to improve. The Congress has no face and is indulging in cheap politics. Let us keep the university campuses out of politics and all political parties should strive together in the endeavour to get rid of caste, creed and communal politics and anti-social elements there,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the long \u201cmisrule\u201d and the \u201cdivisive\u201d agenda of the Congress that had spoiled social harmony, he said.",
