    "text": "7-year-old becomes youngest donor in Mumbai, recipient is also 7\n\n: Around 2.30 a.m. on Sunday, an ambulance with its siren blaring, sped down a road cleared of traffic, with a freshly harvested heart from Hinduja Hospital in Mahim to Fortis in Mulund \u2014 an exercise the city\u2019s organ donation machinery and the city traffic police have, by now, perfected. Only, this time, the heart was that of a seven-year-old, the youngest organ donor recorded in Mumbai. The recipient was also seven, a Goregaon girl suffering from end-stage organ failure. She is the youngest patient to undergo a heart transplant in Mumbai.\n\nThe child donated more than a heart \u2014 his kidneys and liver too were harvested. And the recipients of the kidneys, both in Jaslok Hospital, were also young, aged 11 and 15, with the 11-year-old again being the youngest to undergo a kidney transplant. The liver went to a 31-year-old in Jupiter hospital.\n\nSeven-year-old donor, Deyaan Udani, was on a vacation in Mumbai from Sydney with his family. He complained of a headache and was admitted to Nanavati Hospital on January 22, the day the family was to fly back to Australia. He was shifted to Hinduja Hospital on January 26 and diagnosed with severe cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (blood clot in the brain vessel). \u201cHe underwent a surgery here, but did not recover. He was a healthy child and what caused the condition could not be ascertained,\u201d said Sucheta Desai, transplant coordinator, Hinduja Hospital.\n\nThe child was declared brain dead on January 30, following which the family put the lives of others over its grief and decided to donate his organs.",
