    "text": "With Transgender Model Agency all set to open here soon, the community is looking forward to a new lease of life.\n\nThe agency, which is the brainchild of Rudrani Chettri, a Delhi-based transgender activist and head of Mitr Trust, would be launched with photographer Rishi Raj in charge of the photo operations. Chettri says the idea behind opening up a model agency comes from the feeling of \u2018frustration\u2019 which she and other transgenders had to face.\n\n\u201cThe idea came out of a feeling of frustration as I saw many young beautiful transgenders who are made to feel ugly from a young age. I was one of them,\u201d says Chettri.\n\nEminent fashion stylist and photographer, Rishi Raj aims to get a prominent coverage to the soon-to-be-launched agency in a leading fashion magazine. \u2014 PTI",
