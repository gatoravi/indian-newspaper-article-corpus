    "text": "The need for an alliance between the Left and Congress to oust the Trinamool Congress (TMC) from Bengal was the primary focus of the report tabled in the two- day long State Committee meeting of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) that started on Friday.\n\nState secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra presented the report which discussed the party\u2019s strategy for the upcoming Assembly polls and the significance of having an alliance with the Congress. In presence of the party\u2019s general secretary Sitaram Yechury, majority of the State committee members said the only way to revive the party\u2019s political fortune was to join forces with the Congress, a senior CPI-M leader told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cThe primary focus of the report is the need to join forces with all those, including the Congress, who oppose the Trinamool,\u201d the leader said. He added that the report mentions that the unification of the \u201csecular democratic\u201d forces in Bengal has become all the more relevant in the context of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) rise in the State.\n\n\u201cPrimarily the report has a two-point agenda. First is to remove Mamata Banerjee\u2019s Trinamool Congress from Bengal and then to stop the BJP from gaining foothold in the State,\u201d the CPI(M) leader said.\n\nThe top leadership of the Bengal CPI(M), including former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mr. Mishra, were publicly speaking in favour of a Left-Congress tie-up. They made the same argument in public rallies on Thursday. On the same day, all the 11 Left Front constituents agreed that if an official proposal for alliance comes from the Congress the Front should discuss the mater with the party.",
