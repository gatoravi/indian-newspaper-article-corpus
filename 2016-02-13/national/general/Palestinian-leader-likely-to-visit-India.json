External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj met Dr. Mustafa during her visit to Ramallah on November 17 last.\n\nOfficials said Dr. Mustafa\u2019s visit showed early signs of a race for succession to the post of President of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nMr. Abbas, 81, who took office in 2005, is already in his third four-year term. In the last few years, various names have been doing the rounds. Dr. Mustafa, who was the Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Economy Minister, resigned from the posts in 2015.\n\nDr. Mustafa, a finance professional with experience of working in the World Bank, is said to enjoy the support of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the western countries, and his technocratic image sets him up against the likes of the jailed freedom fighter Marwan Barghouti and the Hamas leadership of the Gaza Strip.",
