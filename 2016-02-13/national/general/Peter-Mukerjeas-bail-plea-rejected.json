    "text": "The bail plea of former media baron Peter Mukerjea, arrested in the Sheena Bora murder case, was on Friday rejected by a special CBI , ourt which observed that the charge sheet was yet to be filed and investigation in the matter was still on.\n\nSince investigation into the case was still on, it\u2019s not the right stage to grant bail to Peter, judge H.S. Mahajan said.\n\nThe bail plea will be considered once the charge sheet is submitted, he added.\n\nPeter, whose wife Indrani Mukerjea is the prime accused in the case, was arrested on November 19 for his alleged role in the murder conspiracy.\n\nThe 59-year-old was questioned by CBI for two weeks after which he was remanded in judicial custody and sent to the Arthur Road Jail here.\n\nOther co-accused Sanjeev Khanna and Shyamvar Rai, Indrani\u2019s former driver, too, are in the same jail.\n\nIndrani is lodged at the Byculla women\u2019s jail.\n\nSheena (24), Indrani\u2019s daughter from an earlier relationship, was allegedly strangled in a car in April 2012 and her body burnt and dumped in a forest in adjoining Raigad district. The murder came to light in August last year\n\nThe CBI suspects that financial transactions led to the murder of Sheena. \u2014 PTI",
