The Gateway of India gets six security cameras, they added.\n\nA senior police officer said the cameras will cover interiors as well as the perimeter and external areas of the venues. Dedicated control rooms have been set up at the venues, where the camera feed will be monitored round-the-clock by civic and police officials. These control rooms will also be in constant touch with the police control room.\n\nRegional Quick Response Teams (QRT), formed after the 26/11 terror attacks, will be at the forefront of security arrangements, as these commandoes are trained in modern weaponry and battle tactics, undergo refresher courses and practice sessions on a regular basis, officials said.\n\n\u201cA separate division of around 2,500 police personnel has been formed to focus solely on VIP security. Each VIP will have his own security detail, and we have also arranged for around 100 vehicles so that each VIP gets his own convoy to ensure safe and secure movement in and out of the venues,\u201d another officer said.\n\nWhile the police are mainly relying on their 55,000 personnel, officials said Force One, another fighting force created post-26/11, might be brought in if the need arises for additional manpower. The police are also in touch with state and central intelligence agencies to keep abreast of intelligence alerts, while anti-terror cells of all police stations are providing daily updates from the ground, sources said.",
