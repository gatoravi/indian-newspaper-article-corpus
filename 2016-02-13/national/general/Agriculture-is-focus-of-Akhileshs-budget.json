It, however, did not mention any major schemes for Muslims, a major vote share of the Samajwadi Party.\n\nMr. Yadav, who also holds the Finance portfolio, presented a budget of Rs 3.46 lakh crore, the biggest ever in the State, an increase of 14.6 per cent from last year. New schemes worth Rs 13,842 crore were also launched, with focus on education, infrastructure and agriculture.\n\nIn the final lap of his tenure, Mr. Yadav dedicated the year 2016-17 to the \u201cKisan and Yuva\u201d (farmer and youth) .\n\nThe budget has special provisions for the agriculture sector. Mr. Yadav earmarked Rs 2,057 crore for the drought relief measures in the 50 drought-hit districts of the State, while allocating Rs 1,336 crore as payment for sugar cane arrears.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Assembly Swami Prasad Maurya said the budget neglected Dalits, farmers, minorities and the youth. \u201cThere is no relief for common people,\u201d Mr. Maurya said.\n\nNew schemes worth Rs 13,842 crore launched; Opposition terms\n\nit \u2018anti-people\u2019",
