There is no doubt about the intentions of the Bihar Chief Minister as he is a gentleman and has a clean image,\u201d said the BJP Rajya Sabha MP R.K. Sinha.\n\nMr. Sinha , though, advised Mr. Kumar to focus more on law and order situation in the State.\n\nMr. Sinha has been in the BJP for a long time and is also a successful businessman.\n\nEarlier, Shatrughan Sinha, the Patna Sahib MP, had praised Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad much to the discomfiture of the BJP. A few days back, Mr. Sinha had met both leaders in Patna and invited them to his book launch function.\n\nAnother Bihar BJP MP from Darbhanga Kirti Jha Azad too had earlier lauded Nitish Kumar\u2019s governance. Mr. Azad had exposed the alleged scam in the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA) and questioned the role of BJP leader Arun Jaitley.\n\nNo one can doubt his intentions as he is a gentleman and has a clean image, says R.K. Sinha",
