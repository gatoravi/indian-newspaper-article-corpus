The students staged a protest outside the office of Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar.\n\nStudents started gathering outside the office from afternoon and continued to protest till late in the evening.\n\n\u201cThe police is mindlessly patrolling the campus and the students are being witch-hunted and demonised. What is the proof that Kanhaiya was there among those raising anti-India slogans? Has he been spotted in any picture or video? Why are all JNU students being given \u2018anti-national\u2019 certificates? We condemn the arrest,\u201d said JNUSU vice president Shehla Rashid Shora.\n\nJNU Teachers\u2019 Association issued a statement terming the \u201cexcessive police action\u201d as an attack on the varsity. \u201cThe JNU teaching community is extremely concerned at the threat to democratic ethos, which has played a critical role in assuring that university serves its social function and secure its position as one of the premier institution of higher education,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the excessive police action was currently uncalled for and it has only aggravated the situation. We also express deep anguish over the university administration's decision to allow them to enter the campus.\u201d",
