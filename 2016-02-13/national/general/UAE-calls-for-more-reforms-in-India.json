According to sources, the structural changes the UAE government has been pressing for include single-window clearance and simplification of \u201ccumbersome and complex processes\u201d.\n\nThe SWFs wanted the Indian government to be a \u201cstrategic partner for safety\u201d of their investments, besides an assurance of a conducive business environment.\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry said among the eight agreements/MoUs exchanged during the official visit of the Crown Prince is an MoU on establishing a \u201cframework\u201d for facilitating the participation of UAE institutional investors in infrastructure investments in India.",
