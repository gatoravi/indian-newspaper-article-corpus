    "text": "After naming Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence and terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in his deposition before a Mumbai court through video conferencing, American-Pakistani terrorist David Coleman Headley on Friday named Al-Qaeda. After successfully conducting the 26/11 attacks in 2008, Headley came back to India in March 2009 as directed by senior Al-Qaeda operative Ilyas Kashmiri.\n\nHe said, \u201cI met Kashmiri in February 2009 and he told me to visit India again to carry out terrorist activities\u201d and that he (Kashmiri) had paid for his entire trip. Kashmiri asked him to go to India again and mentioned a few places to conduct reconnaissance, especially Pushkar, Goa, and the Chabad House in Pune.\n\nHeadley said he did not disclose his working with Al-Qaeda to the LeT because the terror outfit would not allow him to go back to India as it felt insecure after the attacks because of the Indian media, and it apprehended that he would be caught. Headley said Kashmiri, who was in the 313 Brigade of Al-Qaeda, had told him to first visit the National Defence College in Delhi as it was the primary location. He said that LeT was also planning to attack the college.",
