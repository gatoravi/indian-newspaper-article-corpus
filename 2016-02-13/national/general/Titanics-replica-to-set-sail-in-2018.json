We own the Titanic II name and trademark and people are lining up to be part of it,\u201d Mr. McDonald was quoted as saying by Independent . The updated version, physically identical to its predecessor except for small changes made to satisfy modern safety requirements, will offer first, second and third class tickets.\n\nIt will have nine floors to accommodate 2,400 passengers and 900 crew members, besides a swimming pool, Turkish baths and gyms.\n\nThe original Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic \u2014 killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew. \u2014 PTI",
