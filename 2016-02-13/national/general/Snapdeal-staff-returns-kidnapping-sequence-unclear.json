But before he could set out on that fateful day, Mr. Sarna was alarmed following a call by one of Dipti\u2019s friend, who heard her screaming during a phone conversation \u2014 the last phone call made to her phone that day.\n\n\u201cOn the way, the vehicle broke down on Mohan Nagar flyover, forcing the passengers to board another auto which arrived in the next few minutes. That vehicle had three men, including the driver, sitting on the front, while Dipti and two of her co-passengers from the first auto, a man and a woman, also boarded it,\u201d said Mr. Sarna.\n\nA little ahead, the only other woman passenger in the auto was forced to get off at knifepoint by the four men in the vehicle. The men then drove the auto to a secluded area in Raj Nagar extension.According to the police, it was near Morti that they switched their mode of transport and boarded an i10. The four men then drove for several hours while Dipti remained blindfolded, she later told her parents. A few hours later, they got down from the vehicle.\n\n\u201cShe said it was a long walk. Despite not having any sense of direction or time, she estimates that they walked for nearly 10 km before stopping at an unfamiliar location,\u201d said Mr. Sarna.\n\nHe added that it was there that the blindfold was removed and in the victim\u2019s sight were sugarcane plants in a field. This was early on Thursday morning. It was in the field that she spent several hours with the four men, who told her that they had plans to take her to someone \u201cknown to her\u201d, though they themselves weren\u2019t.\n\nSenior Superintendent of Police (Ghaziabad) Dharmendra Singh added that the men also gave her wafers to eat in the field. Under what the police believe was pressure mounted by them and the massive social media campaign, the alleged abductors decided to set her free.\n\n\u201cThey blindfolded her again and walked with her to a nearby railway station. She was given Rs.100 and told to board the next train going to Delhi,\u201d he added.\n\nDipti told the police that she learnt from the co-passengers that it was coming from Haryana\u2019s Panipat and was headed towards New Delhi railway station.",
