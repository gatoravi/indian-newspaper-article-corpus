Ghose and N.V. Ramana took on the State of Kerala and the Travancore Devaswom Board, asking whether the Vedas, Upanishads and scriptures discriminate between men and women.\n\n\u201cIs spirituality solely within the domain of men? Are you saying that women are incapable of attaining spirituality within the domain of religion,\u201d Justice Misra asked.\n\n\u201cCan you deprive a mother?\u201d Justice Misra asked at one point during the hearing on the tradition that bars the entry of women of a certain age into the temple.\n\nSenior advocate Indira Jaising, intervening on behalf of an association of law students in a batch of petitions challenging the ban, said there are \u201cwomen brahmacharis too in this world.\u201d\n\n\u201cCelibacy is not the exclusive privilege of men. The Constitution says \u2018throw open\u2019 the doors of public religious spaces to the entire human race. Are women not part of the human race?\u201d Ms. Jaising asked in court.\n\nJustice Misra said religion is distinct from cult culture. \u201cCult culture has a core group. Entry is restricted to others considered as outsiders. Religion is holistic \u2014 Sanatan Dharma \u2014 and includes one and all without discrimination of sex, caste and gender,\u201d Justice Misra observed.\n\nAppearing for the State government, senior advocate V. Giri submitted that \u201cover centuries, this prohibition has been ingrained in the minds of the devotees.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Bench asked Mr. Giri why his client had now turned a \u201csomersault\u201d from its earlier position in favour of allowing women entry into the temple.\n\n\u201cThe God is a celibate. The men who go there to worship are called \u2018swamy\u2019,\u201d senior advocate K.K. Venugopal added.\n\n\u2018Why this discrimination?\u2019\n\n\u201cSo is this tradition of prohibition bound to stay on despite the fundamental right of equality envisaged in the Constitution? If discrimination is not there in the Vedas, the Upanishads, tell us when this kind of distinction started in history?\u201d Justice Misra asked.\n\n\u201cA temple is a public religious phenomenon and its functions should come within the constitutional parameters,\u201d Justice Misra observed.\n\nThe court granted Mr. Venugopal six weeks to file an affidavit which he said would contain information on the traditions of the temple dating a thousand years, in support of the prohibition.\n\nIt said the case would require in-depth research on legal, constitutional and even spiritual questions and appointed senior advocate Raju Ramachandran as an amicus curiae .",
