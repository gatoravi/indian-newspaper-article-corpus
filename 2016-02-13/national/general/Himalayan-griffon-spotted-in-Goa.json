It is indeed the Himalayan griffon,\u201d said Mr. Dharwadkar, who was the first to spot the avian.\n\nAccording to the GBCN, the Himalayan griffon was previously believed to belong to the upper Himalayas and was presumed to stray till the Gangetic plains at the most. In 2013, however, \u201can exhausted juvenile\u201d was rescued in Thrissur district of Kerala. In the same year, multiple sightings of the species were also reported from Bangalore in Karnataka and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. Earlier this year, the same species was reportedly spotted in Kaiga in Karnataka, the network of avid birdwatchers said.\n\n\u201cHimalayan griffons do not breed in the first three years, and hence juvenile birds of the species do not remain in breeding grounds to avoid competition,\u201d said Pronoy Baidya, a reviewer for eBird .",
