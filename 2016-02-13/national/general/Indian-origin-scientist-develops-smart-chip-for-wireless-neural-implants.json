    "text": "An Indian-origin scientist has developed a smart chip that can be paired with neural implants for efficient wireless transmission of brain signals \u2014 thus alleviating the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease or giving paraplegic people the ability to move prosthetic limbs. Assistant professor Arindam Basu from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said the research team has tested the chip on data recorded from animal models which showed that it could decode the brain\u2019s signal to the hand and fingers with 95 per cent accuracy.\n\n\u201cWhat we have developed is a very versatile smart chip that can process data, analyse patterns and spot the difference,\u201d Prof. Basu said.\n\nCurrently, neural implants when embedded in the brain need to be connected by wires to an external device outside the body.\n\nFor a prosthetic patient, the neural implant is connected to a computer that decodes the brain signals so the artificial limb can move.\n\nThese external wires are not only cumbersome but the permanent openings which allow the wires into the brain increase the risk of infections. The new chip can allow the transmission of brain data wirelessly and with high accuracy.\n\n\u201cThe chip is about a hundred times more efficient than current processing chips on the market. It will lead to more compact medical wearable devices, such as portable ECG monitoring devices and neural implants,\u201d Prof. Basu explained. \u2014 IANS",
