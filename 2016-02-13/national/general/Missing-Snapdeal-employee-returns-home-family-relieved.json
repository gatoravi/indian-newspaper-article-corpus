He said Deepti Sarna has not been \u201cphysically harmed\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will probe as to how she had gone to Panipat. We are very sure that she has not been physically harmed and she is fine,\u201d the SP told reporters here.\n\nOn Wednesday, around 8.30 p.m., Deepti went missing after she was travelling in an auto she had hired from outside Vaishali Metro Station. According to the police, Deepti was on her way from Vaishali metro station to the old bus stand of Ghaziabad where her father, Narendra Sarna, a resident of Kavi Nagar, was waiting to pick her up.\n\nDeepti\u2019s father said that she called him up in the morning and told him that she was in train in Panipat and coming to Vaishali.\n\n\u201cShe told me that she will come to Vaishali, but I asked her not to come to Vaishali and said I will come to New Delhi Railway Station to pick her. I don\u2019t know how she came [managed to escape]. She was calling me up from the phone of her co-passenger in the train,\u201d he told reporters here.\n\nAfter she went missing, her father had told the police that when the auto crossed the Hindon river bridge on Wednesday\u2019s evening, Deepti called him and gave him the location.\n\nShe was also heard shouting at the auto driver for taking a wrong route, he had said, adding thereafter her phone was switched off.\n\nPolice had soon swung into action and launched a manhunt to search the girl. \u2014 PTI",
