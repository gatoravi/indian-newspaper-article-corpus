    "text": "In a first indicator that India is reconsidering its reluctance to joint military policing with other countries, a senior U.S. naval officer says Indian and U.S. officials have discussed joint naval patrols, though concrete steps are yet to be finalised.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , he refused to elaborate if the discussions covered joint patrol of the South China Sea.\n\nThe disclosure comes a year after the two countries signed a joint vision statement which called for \u201csafeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over-flight\u201d throughout the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe U.S. officer\u2019s statement comes in the light of a Reuters report two days ago claiming that the two sides have held talks on conducting joint naval patrols, including in the disputed South China Sea. The report was denied by the U.S. State Department later.\n\nIndia and the U.S. continue to explore ways to deepen their bilateral defence cooperation, the officer said, including in the area of maritime security within the \u201cFramework for the U.S.-India Defence Relationship\u201d, signed by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and U.S. Defence Secretary Ashton Carter during the former\u2019s visit to the U.S. last June.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work with our Indian counterparts on how and where to expand engagement in this area. On the matter of joint patrols, I can confirm that some informal discussions have occurred, but no decisions have been made,\u201d the officer told The Hindu in an e-mail response.\n\nHowever, he refused to provide more specifics at this time due to the \u201csensitivities\u201d involved with the subject.\n\nResponding to questions on the Reuters report, the U.S. State Department said denied plans for joint patrols at present, but did not rule out holding discussions. \u201cThe United States and India do have a shared vision of peace, stability and prosperity in Asia,\u201d State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington on Thursday. \u201cAt this time, there are no plans for any joint naval patrols.\u201d\n\n\u2018Only under UN mandate\u2019\n\nDefence Ministry officials declined to comment. Naval officers responded on similar lines, saying it was not for their service to take a decision. An External Affairs Ministry official said there was \u201cno such proposal\u201d, without getting into details.\n\nIndia has consistently maintained that it would not join any military coalition except under the mandate of the United Nations.",
