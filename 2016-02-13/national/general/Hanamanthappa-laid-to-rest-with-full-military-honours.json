Music bands further charged the atmosphere by playing patriotic songs.\n\nAfter a stop at Hubballi\u2019s Nehru Stadium, where around 40,000 people paid their respects, the mortal remains of the soldier were brought in an embellished military truck to Betadur, with scores of vehicles carrying Hanamanthappa\u2019s portrait and tricolour following it. After pre-funeral rituals at the soldier\u2019s house in the village, the body was kept at the government school to allow people to pay their last respects.\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah, who had received the body at Hubballi Airport on Thursday night, paid his last respects at the Nehru Stadium on Friday and visited the soldier\u2019s family in Betadur before proceeding to attend his other engagements.\n\nHis Cabinet colleagues H.K. Patil and Vinay Kulkarni, Union Minister Ananth Kumar, former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, and senior officers of the Madras Regiment and the Maratha Light Infantry were among those who attended the funeral.\n\nSiddaramaiah, his Cabinet collegues and senior Army officers paid their last respects",
