Otherwise, serious fines would be imposed on them.\n\nThe 45 plants, Mr.Prakash said, had a capacity of generating 10 lakh tonnes of organic fertilizers, but they were producing only 1.5 tonnes due to the market monopoly of urea producing companies.\n\nThe government is also weighing whether to offer a deal where subsidy would be granted if one bag of municipal compost is bought with every two bags of chemically rich urea.",
