His argument followed that of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, also appearing for the Gandhis, that the essential ingredient in the offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust was that only the aggrieved person had the locus standi to move court. \u201cWe have no great ideas of interfering. We are not happy with what the judge said. There will be a trial, and the remarks of the judge had prejudiced it,\u201d Justice J.S. Khehar said.",
