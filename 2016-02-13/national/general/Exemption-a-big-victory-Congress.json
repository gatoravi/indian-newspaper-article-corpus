    "text": "The Congress on Friday presented the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the National Herald case as a significant victory that \u201cvindicates the position of the party and its leadership.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , former Law Minister and the member of the party\u2019s legal team, Ashwani Kumar, said that he has \u201cfull faith\u201d in the integrity of the judicial process. \u201cI am fully confident that in a fair trial the innocence of the Congress leadership will be fully established.\u201d\n\nA Supreme Court Bench led by Justice J.S. Khehar \u201cexpunged\u201d the striking observations previously made by the Delhi High Court that accused Congress leadership, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, of \u201ccriminal intent\u201d prior to the trial. The Bench also exempted the Gandhis from appearing in future court proceedings.\n\nHowever, the BJP termed the Supreme Court order as \u201ca slap on the face\u201d of the Congress leadership since it did not reverse the criminal proceedings against them before the lower court.\n\nOn the exemptions from appearing in future proceedings, the party said it was \u201cconditional\u201d as the Gandhis can be summoned whenever the court wishes to.\n\nIt\u2019s a big blow, says BJP\n\n\u201cIt is a big blow [to the Congress] and a slap on the face of those who had gone to the court with a plea that the case be quashed. The apex court has maintained that they will face trial as accused in the case,\u201d said the party national secretary, Shrikant Sharma.",
