Kalifulla and S.A. Bobde directed all States and Union Territories, especially Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, to strictly enforce the Centre\u2019s to check \u201cundesired and unhealthy\u201d practice of forcing young girls to serve as Devadasis. Urgency was shown by the Bench when Supreme Court advocate V.K. Biju, representing the Kerala-based NGO, S.L. Foundation, drew the court\u2019s attention to the lacklustre approach of the State authorities and the police forces of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu to the problem. He contended that neither were the police enforcing the law nor were the State governments properly utilising funds allocated for the rehabilitation of girls who were pushed into the Devadasi system. Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand claimed that State-level legislation such as the Karnataka Devadasis Prohibition of Dedication Act, 1982, and Maharashtra Devadasis Abolition Act, 2006, had completely abolished such practices. The practice of Devadasis system violates Sections 370 and 370 A of the IPC as amended through the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013.",
