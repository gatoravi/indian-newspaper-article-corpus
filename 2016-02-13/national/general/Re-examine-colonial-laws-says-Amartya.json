    "text": "Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has said that the colonial laws that still govern us must not remain unchallenged.\n\nDelivering the annual Rajendra Mathur Memorial Lecture on \u201cThe centrality of the right to dissent\u201d organised by the Editors Guild of India here on Friday, Professor Sen wondered at the continued hold of the colonial laws.\n\nHe called for a re-examination of those such as Section 377, which criminalises homosexuality, and Section 295 A of the Indian Penal Code, which he said imposed \u201cunfreedom\u201d on people. \u201c\u2018Unfreedom\u2019 is no longer imposed on us by our colonial masters. Have these \u2018unfreedoms\u2019 really ended? Laws legislated by imperial rulers still govern many parts of our life,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Section 295 A, a person could be sentenced for hurting religious sentiments, \u201chowever personal and however bizarrely delicate that outraged sentiment might be\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not have anything against having beef or storing it in the refrigerator,\u201d Professor Sen said.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not that Indians have turned intolerant. It is to the contrary. We have been much too tolerant even of intolerance. When some people are attacked by organised detractors, they need our support. It is not adequate for us to be offended by their attack,\u201d he said.",
