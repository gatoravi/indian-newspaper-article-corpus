    "text": "G. Sivarajan Commission inquiring into the solar scam has sought the opinion of the parties in seeking extension of time as the panel\u2019s term will come to an end on April 27.\n\nAll the parties to the commission agreed to the proposal and suggested the commission to initiate steps to seek extension. The commission sought the views when it met here on Friday. Roshan D. Alexander, the senior government pleader, informed the commission that the view of the State government in this regard will be communicated on Monday.\n\nMr. Sivarajan said it would require extra time to do full justice to the job. The term of the panel was extended four times. It was two-and-a-half years ago that the panel was constituted to probe the scam that shook the State politics.\n\nThe chairman said the panel was constituted to look into the allegations that were raised against those in power and the job has to be completed with transparency and in a truthful manner. He informed that 39 more witnesses need to be examined, which may take two months.\n\nMr. Sivarajan termed the public response of some senior lawyers as sad. The observation came while referring to the statements made by the senior lawyers who represented the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Power Minister Aryadan Muhammad.",
