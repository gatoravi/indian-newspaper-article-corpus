    "text": "Punjab Congress president Capt. Amarinder Singh on Friday dared Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal to come clean on the circulation of posters showing him and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the spearhead of the Khalistan movement.\n\n\u201cThe AAP should lodge an FIR and get the matter investigated. Why are they [AAP] afraid,\u201d said Capt. Amarinder, adding that the Congress would not allow the AAP to play the \u201cdouble game\u201d of stealthily playing the extremist card and then denying it later.\n\n\u201cIf Kejriwal\u2019s party was not behind these posters, then why hasn\u2019t the AAP\u2019s Punjab convener, Sucha Singh Chhotepur, filed a complaint,\u201d asked Capt. Amarinder.\n\n\u2018Dangerous agenda\u2019\n\nThe former Punjab Chief Minister rubbished accusations levelled by Mr. Kejriwal that he [Capt. Amarinder] was behind the circulation of the posters.\n\n\u201cFirst, the AAP circulated posters asking people to celebrate Bhindranwale\u2019s birthday in Punjab and when it boomeranged on it, Mr. Kejriwal tried to back out in his characteristic manner,\u201d he said.\n\nCapt. Amarinder said the AAP was pursuing an extremely dangerous agenda and the poster episode was part of its campaign strategy to mislead young minds.\n\n\u201cI have told you [Mr. Kejriwal] earlier also, if you want to come to Punjab come as a democratic party, but for god\u2019s sake don\u2019t use disruptive ways as Punjab cannot afford another dark era of violence and bloodshed,\u201d he said.\n\nPosters showing Kejriwal and Bhindranwale kick up a row",
