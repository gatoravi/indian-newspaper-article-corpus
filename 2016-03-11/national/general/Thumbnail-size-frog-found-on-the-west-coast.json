He then contacted a team of researchers from Gubbi Labs, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru, and National University of Singapore, who confirmed the discovery.\n\nThe frog is just 1.7 cm in length (smaller than a 50 paise coin). It is found primarily in small pools that fill up in the monsoon in and around Manipal and Mangaluru.\n\n\u201cIt can be easily missed as its call resembles that of a cricket, and it calls from small cavities within laterite rocks. The analysis of calls provided additional evidence,\u201d says Gururaja K.V. from Gubbi Labs, who also co-authored a paper describing the species.\n\nThe researcher\u2019s analysis shows that the frog is found only in a 150 sq km area of coastal Karnataka, making it eligible for a classification under the endangered category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
