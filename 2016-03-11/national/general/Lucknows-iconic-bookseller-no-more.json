His family owned a chain of bookstores. In 1951, he set up his store, \u2018Ram Advani Booksellers,\u2019 in the present location, nestled among the palatial buildings of Hazratganj, a market area.\n\nThe shop has been a haunt for booklovers, researchers, investigating authors and anyone interested in knowing about the past of the city or Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIts customers included some of India\u2019s tallest politicians, including the first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the former Chief Minister, G.B. Pant. But it was the man whom customers and friends remember for his wide-ranging knowledge and ability to keep a conversation going. The old-timers of the city recall him as a resourceful person always willing to help those who came to him.\n\nSenior journalist Pradeep Kapoor said Advani was a \u201cwalking encyclopaedia,\u201d whose \u201cfirst-hand information\u201d of historical events was a treat for journalists and researchers.\n\n\u201cEven at 95, when I met him on his birthday, he talked about taking retirement only at 99. Lucknow University wanted to felicitate him with a lifetime achievement award. \u2018Why me? I am an ordinary bookseller,\u2019 he replied. Such was his humility,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said.\n\nEven in his last days, when he was down with illness, Advani was \u201cextremely positive and enthusiastic,\u201d said historian and author Saleem Kidwai, who was close to him.\n\n\u201cHe mentored three generations of scholars. Scholars would come to him looking for guidance not only on subjects concerning Lucknow but also Uttar Pradesh and India. He was an endless repository on any subject,\u201d Mr. Kidwai said. \u201cLucknow has lost its biggest mentor,\u201d he said.\n\nChief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said the bookseller would be remembered for creating a love for reading among many.\n\nAuthors and scholars also took to social media to express their grief.\n\nAuthor William Darylmple tweeted: \u201cSad news this morning-the death of the great Ram Advani of Hazratgunj. He goes to join M Bafna & old Mr Bahri in the heavenly bookstore.\u201d\n\nNepali writer Kanak Mani Dixit called Advani\u2019s bookshop a \u201cSouthasian institution.\u201d\n\nWriter Akshay Mukul, who authored a recent book on the Gita Press, recalled Advani\u2019s help in sourcing materials for his publication. \u201cEnd of an era,\u201d Mukul tweeted.\n\nRam Advani\u2019s shop was a haunt for those interested\n\nin knowing about\n\nthe city\u2019s past",
