He then told party workers that if they came across autos with new permits, they should torch them after disembarking the passengers.\n\nThe Congress and the NCP slammed Mr. Thackeray for attempting to incite violence, and slammed Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on his government\u2019s silence on the issue.\n\n\u201cHe should be arrested for this utter nonsense,\u201d Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said: \u201cIt is shocking that somebody makes a hate speech and he is allowed to go scot-free. The government should take prompt action.\u201d\n\nSamajwadi Party Mumbai chief Abu Asim Azmi, who was beaten up by MNS legislators on the opening day of the new Assembly in 2009 for refusing to take oath in Marathi, condemned Mr. Thackeray\u2019s speech, and warned that SP workers will \u201cretaliate\u201d if the MNS targets north Indian migrants again.\n\n\u201cMarathi voters had rejected Raj Thackeray in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections followed by Assembly polls. Even in Nashik, his party is breaking up. That\u2019s why, as in 2008-2009, he is trying drive a wedge between peace loving Marathi-speaking people and Hindi-speaking people, and threatening the law and order situation,\u201d said Mr. Azmi, who will meet Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis demanding action against the MNS leader.\n\nSenior Mumbai police officials said the department was closely scrutinising Mr. Thackeray\u2019s speech delivered at the 10th foundation day of his party at the Shanmukhananda Hall on Wednesday night. \u201cWe will not allow anyone to take the law and order in his or her own hands,\u201d Minister of State for Home Ram Shinde told reporters. Though Home Minister Fadnavis maintained silence, Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar condemned Mr. Thackeray\u2019s speech on Thursday.\n\nRaj Thackeray-led MNS had damaged the prospects of Shiv Sena-BJP in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls by making inroads into the Marathi vote bank, and won 13 seats in the Assembly elections that followed. However, the MNS received its worst drubbing during the 2014 polls, reducing its strength from 13 to just one MLA in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly",
