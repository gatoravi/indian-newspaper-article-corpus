    "text": "Selena caught in elevator scare\n\nSinger-actor Selena Gomez had quite a fright after getting stuck in an elevator in Paris. The Come and Get It star is in the French capital for the Paris Fashion Week, but the excitement came to a grinding halt when she and a group of passengers in a lift got trapped between floors at an undisclosed venue.\n\nGomez, 23, took to Twitter to post a 19-second video of her harrowing journey. \u201cThat time we got stuck in an elevator in Paris... \u201d she captioned the brief footage.\n\nIn the clip, she starts to say, \u201cIf we keep talking, the oxygen...,\u201d before a male next to the pop star yells to someone on the other side of the elevator entrance, instructing them to pry open the metal doors.\n\nThe man finally manages to open the doors, much to the relief of Gomez and her close friends, who cheered as they prepared to escape.\n\nThe lift drama came the same day the singer arrived in Paris, where she is expected to attend shows during the final two days of the Paris Fashion Week.\n\n\u2014 PTI",
