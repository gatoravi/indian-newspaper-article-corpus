    "text": "A recently discovered painting by 17th-century Dutch master Rembrandt will be the star attraction at one of the world's leading art fairs opening this week, Dutch media reported Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Unconscious Patient,\u201d also known as \u201cSmell,\u201d a small paperback-sized panel believed to have been painted by Rembrandt in his late teens, was uncovered last September when it was put up for sale by a small auction house in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cIt was peeling at the edges and covered with a layer of dirt,\u201d daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported. The painting was originally listed with a maximum guide price of just $800.\n\nAfter a frantic bidding war by art collectors who suspected the panel's true origins, it was snapped up by Paris-based art trader Talabardon & Gautier for around one million dollars.\n\nThe painting forms part of five panels depicting the human senses which Rembrandt painted when he was 18 and 19 years old and they are among his earliest works.\n\n\u201cSmell\u201d depicts a barber or surgeon who has just performed a blood-letting on an unconscious young man, with an old woman attempting to revive him by holding an ammonia-soaked cloth under his nose.\n\nThree other panels \u2014 \u201cSight,\u201d \u201cHearing\u201d and \u201cTouch\u201d were discovered in the 1930s. \u2014 AFP",
