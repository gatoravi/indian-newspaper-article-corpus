Now, less then 12,000 remain in the wild, all in Africa, except for a tiny population of less than 100 in Iran. The rapid decline of the cheetahs could have been sharper without Ms. Marker\u2019s high-profile tireless efforts.\n\nA formidable campaigner and acknowledged world expert, she founded the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in 1990. She saw her first when she was 20 and went to work at a wildlife park in the US state of Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the few places in the world that had cheetahs. They had come from Namibia and they fascinated me,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know everything about them, but the more questions I asked people would say \u2018Hmm, we don't know much about them, if you find out something, let us know.\u2019\u201dMs. Marker raised an orphaned female cheetah cub named Khayam in Oregon and, in 1977, took Khayam to Namibia, then known as South-West Africa. She planned to see if the young cheetah could be taught to hunt for prey as part of research into whether captive cheetahs could be re-introduced into the wild.\n\nBut soon after her arrival, she learnt about a more immediate emergency \u2014 farmers were poisoning, trapping and shooting huge numbers of cheetahs. Namibian farmers continue to kill cheetahs because they threaten valuable livestock, while poachers steal cubs to sell as pets to wealthy clients.The threat has driven Ms. Marker on a decades-long effort to halt poaching and persuade farmers that a balance can be struck between raising livestock and protecting wildlife.\n\n\u201cNow young farmers want training about how to live with cheetahs. Most of our wildlife is outside protected areas, so it is the farmers who are the stewards.\u201d \u2014 AFP",
