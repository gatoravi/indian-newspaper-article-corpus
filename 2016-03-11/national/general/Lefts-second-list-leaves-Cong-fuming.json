    "text": "The list includes seats where the Congress had announced candidates\n\n: With the Left Front\u2019s announcement on Thursday of a second list of 84 candidates for the 294-seat Bengal Assembly, the Front-Congress alliance suffered a major set back as the latter had announced candidates for 14 of these seats on Tuesday.\n\nThe Left Front announced its own candidates for 11 of these and has left three others for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal (United) (JD[U]).\n\nThe Left Front and the Congress had entered into a \u201cseat sharing understanding\u201d, publicly announcing that they would not pit candidates against each other to ensure that a consensus candidate obtains the anti-Trinamool vote. But the Left Front\u2019s announcement on Thursday, has severely annoyed the Congress\u2019 State leadership.\n\nOne of the senior leaders negotiating seats with the Left, Rajya Sabha MP Pradip Bhattacharya, said the Front\u2019s second list will have a \u201csevere negative impact on the Left-Congress alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cA calculated move to create political misunderstanding is being undertaken by the Left parties. This is extremely unfortunate. I am having severe doubts about the Left's goodwill in sustaining the alliance,\u201d Mr Bhattacharya said.\n\nState Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, however, was cautiously optimistic about the future of the alliance in the wake of Thursday\u2019s developments. Admitting that the overlapping seats may increase \u201cfriendly fights\u201d between Left and Congress, he said there was no lack of \u201crespect to the public mood\u201d on the part of the Congress.",
