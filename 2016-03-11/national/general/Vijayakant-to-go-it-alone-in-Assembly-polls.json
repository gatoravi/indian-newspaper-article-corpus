    "text": "Decade after entering the political landscape dominated by the Dravidian parties and projecting himself as an alternative force, actor-turned-politician Vijayakant took the greatest gamble of his political career on Thursday evening.\n\nBy announcing that his party, the DMDK, would contest the ensuing Assembly polls alone, Mr. Vijayakant has staked his claim to be the next chief minister. The numbers are definitely not on his side. Still, he has risked everything that he has got and as a strategy, through his wife Premalatha, he has asked \u201clike-minded outfits\u201d to approach his party.\n\nIf one went by the 2011 Assembly poll results, the Dravidian majors together command a vote share of over 60 per cent. A new front, the People\u2019s Welfare Front comprising the MDMK, the CPI, the CPI (M) and the VCK, has also come up on the horizon with coalition mantra.",
