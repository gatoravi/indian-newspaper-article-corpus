    "text": "Cutting across political lines, Bihar MLAs on Thursday condemned Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray for his \u201chate-speech\u201d against non-Marathis and demanded action against him.\n\nMr. Thackeray said on Wednesday that three-wheelers with new permits would be set on fire because, he alleged, nearly 70 per cent of the auto-rickshaws recently cleared to run on Mumbai's roads belonged to non-Maharashtrians.\n\nAs the Assembly session began, some legislators raised slogans against Mr. Thackeray both inside and outside. They were joined by other MLAs later who demanded action against the MNS leader.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Narendra Modi should take immediate action against him,\u201d said Deputy Chief Minister and younger son of Lalu Prasad, Tejaswi Yadav. Speaking to journalists later, he added that \u201cthis was not the first time that Raj Thackeray has said something against the Biharis\u2026but I wonder why the BJP has not taken any action against him yet.\u201d\n\nCongress MLA Ajit Sharma also said the government should take legal action against Mr. Thackeray for creating hatred against Hindi-speaking people in Mumbai while the BJP leader Vinod Narayan Jha said Mr. Thackeray\u2019s comments were \u201cnot in favour of a united country\u201d.\n\nHindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) leaders said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take notice of the hate speech. JD(U) leader and spokesperson Ajay Alok said: \u201cNow we\u2019ll see how the Prime Minister takes action against those fanning regionalism in the country.\u201d\n\nMLAs across the political spectrum condemn\n\nMNS leader\u2019s\n\nhate speech",
