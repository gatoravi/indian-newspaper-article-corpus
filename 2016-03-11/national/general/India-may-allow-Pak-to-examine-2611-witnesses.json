On Wednesday, it also wanted the boats used by the attackers to be produced in court.\n\n\u201cThe list of the witnesses to be examined by the Judicial Commission had been agreed upon by the two governments, as were the terms of reference of the Judicial Commission. If and when we receive a formal request from Pakistan conveying details of these 24 witnesses, we will consider it,\u201d Vikas Swarup, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said on Thursday.\n\nOfficials, however, told The Hindu that India\u2019s willingness to allow cross examination of witnesses by the Pakistani court should not be interpreted as a move to send all of them across to Islamabad for a hearing. There were various other ways to cross-examine witnesses. \u201cPakistani authorities can try video-conferencing. So finally, there may not be any need for the witnesses to travel to Pakistan,\u201d an official told The Hindu .",
