    "text": "The Bombay High Court on Thursday refused to accept that an educated, adult woman could term a consensual relationship as rape after the man allegedly promised to marry her but then failed to deliver on that promise.\n\nThe court was hearing the anticipatory bail plea of a man who had entered into a relationship with a 24-year-old woman last March. On October 7 , she filed a case of rape at the Goregaon police station.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be rape,\u201d said Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting the man anticipatory bail. \u201cYou [the complainant] can say no. You are educated and a major; you have the right to say no\u2026 I grant bail in such matters because it is not rape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheated\u201d\n\nThe complainant\u2019s lawyer, Aniket Nikam, claimed that if she refused sex the man would assault her and that although he had promised to marry the complainant, he had actually cheated her. He contended that the woman had conceived and that following pressure from the man went for an abortion. \u201cThereafter she found he wasn\u2019t ready to marry her,\u201d said the order, recording the lawyer\u2019s submissions.\n\n\u201cShe helped him financially in the hope he would marry her. He cheated her by giving a false promise.\u201d\n\nManoj Mohite, appearing for the accused, said it was a relationship of mutual consent and not of rape.\n\nThe court said, \u201cConsidering the age [of the complainant], I am inclined to grant bail.\u201d The man was ordered to post a surety of Rs 25,000 and not attempt to get in touch with the woman.\n\nHC grants man anticipatory bail",
