Once she was satisfied, she requested the groom to undergo an HIV test.\n\nThe match got finalised once the boy was tested negative for HIV, a mandatory test for those who want to marry girls under the custody of Ms. Sujatha.\n\nBeing a mother of two sons \u2013 Sridhar, who is pursuing his graduation at IIT Mumbai, and Sashidhar, who is pursuing an MBBS at Karimnagar \u2013 she has performed marriage for four of her \u2018daughters\u2019 in the last 13 months.\n\nMarriage of one more girl was scheduled in the next few weeks.\n\nShe has the full support of her husband, Srinivas Murthy. Each marriage would cost about Rs. 40,000 for Ms. Sujatha, who meets the expenditure with the support of donors.\n\nLocal legislator G. Mahipal Reddy also contributed the required amount for one of the marriages.\n\nMs. Sujatha has been running SPEARDS for the past seven years, and to date, there have been 26 girls who reached her seeking a helping hand.\n\nChanged perspective\n\nSurprisingly, there is a clear changed perspective in the society, as well-settled youngsters are coming forward to marry girls from this orphanage.\n\n\u201cA youth from a higher caste came forward and married a girl who stayed in our home for more than five years.\n\n\u201cThe father of that youth called and thanked me for gifting a good daughter- in-law, though he was averse to this marriage,\u201d Ms. Sujatha told The Hindu .\n\nShe was also registering marriages as per norms.",
