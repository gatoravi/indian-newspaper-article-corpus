The computer uses two sets of \u201cdeep neutral networks\u201d that allow it to crunch data in a more human-like fashion \u2014 dumping millions of potential moves that human players would instinctively know were pointless. It also employs algorithms that allow it to learn and improve from matchplay experience.\n\nHailed as the \u201cmatch of the century\u201d by local media, the showdown at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul is being closely watched by AI experts as well as tens of millions of Go fans mostly in East Asia.\n\nThe matches are being as broadcast live on major TV and cable channels in South Korea, Japan and China, with many Go fans rooting for Lee.\n\n\u201cHe is fighting alone against dozens of the world\u2019s top scientists and computers with massive processing power... I can\u2019t imagine how much pressure Lee is under,\u201d one online commentator wrote during Thursday\u2019s game.\n\nLee appeared to struggle early on after AlphaGo made several moves that were \u201cshockingly unconventional,\u201d said Kim Seong-Ryong, a Go commentator and professional player. \u2014 AFP",
