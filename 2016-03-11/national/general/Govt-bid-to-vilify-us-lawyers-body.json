    "text": "Lawyers Collective (LC) has accused the government of making a \u201cdeliberate and sustained effort to target and vilify\u201d the 35-year-old public trust and its chief functionaries, including former Additional Solicitor General Indira Jaising, by accusing them of violations under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) (FCRA) Act, 2010.\n\nIn a statement circulated via e-mail on Thursday, it refuted allegations of misuse of funds that were being circulated through sections of the media. LC said its accounts were available in the public domain, accessible to all. Foreign contributions received were used only for the assigned purposes as per FCRA provisions.\n\n\u201cIt is no coincidence that in recent times, the founding trustees of LC \u2014 Ms. Indira Jaising and Mr. Anand Grover \u2014 in the course of their professional duties as lawyers, have defended cases of Priya Pillai (Green Peace India), Teesta Setalvad and Yakub Memon that have caused discomfort to many in the current establishment. Ms. Jaising also recently represented Sanjiv Bhatt, the IPS officer from Gujarat, demanding an independent investigation by SIT into false and frivolous FIRs lodged against him in the State of Gujarat,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) cancelled FCRA registration of over 15,000 NGOs in the past year.\n\n\u201cNone of their accounts/details were made public, with the exception of Green Peace India and Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace and now LC. This deliberate and selective disclosure, contrary to the law, speaks volumes about the real motive and intent behind the entire exercise,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cDeliberate and selective disclosure speaks volumes about its real motive\u201d",
