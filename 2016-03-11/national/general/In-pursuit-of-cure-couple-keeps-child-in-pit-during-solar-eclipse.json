The couple waited for the solar eclipse to end, even as the child cried.\n\n\u201cSomeone told us that it would cure him of his deformity,\u201d Basavaraj told The Hindu . Now that the two-hour ordeal has not healed the boy, does he still believe in the advice? He is not sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know. My well-wishers are telling me that we made a mistake. They say it is blind belief. They have asked me not to repeat it,\u201d he said.\n\nMallikarjun, Basavaraj\u2019s brother-in-law, said that they would not do such a thing in the future.\n\nSangeeta, however, believes the compost pit-treatment during the eclipse has helped the boy. \u201cWe took him to doctors in Umarga in Maharashtra and Basava Kalyan. His condition did not improve. But now, he seems to have improved,\u201d she said.\n\nA government doctor in Basava Kalyan confirmed that the child did not suffer from polio. He said that it was some congenital deformity and that corrective surgery could help the boy. Sangeetha said that she was willing to consult a surgeon if she got a chance to do so.\n\nAs the news spread on Thursday, Sri Channaveera Shivacharya Swami of Harkud Math and Sri Shivanand Swamy of Hulsoor Math went to the house of the couple in Basava Kalyan and urged them to shun harbouring blind belief regarding eclipses. A team of rationalists would visit Basava Kalyan to create awareness against blind belief associated with eclipses, Shashidhar Kosambe, member, Child Welfare Committee, said.",
