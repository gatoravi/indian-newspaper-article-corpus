Doctors announced several days later that the operation had been a success.\n\nOn Monday, the surgical team held a news conference during which the 26-year-old recipient briefly appeared smiling.\n\nThe hospital said it was reviewing why the transplant failed, adding that its clinical trial \u2014 which aims to carry out uterus transplants in 10 women \u2014 will continue.\n\nDoctors at Sweden\u2019s University of Gothenburg were the first to successfully perform a uterus transplant in 2013.\n\nThe recipient gave birth to the first child to be conceived in an implanted womb in September 2014.\n\nThe Swedish team has enabled four healthy births to date. The transplant is temporary, meant to enable women to deliver up to two children over a five-year period.\n\nThe transplanted uterus must then be removed to end exposure to drugs meant to prevent women\u2019s bodies from rejecting the transplanted organs.\n\n\u2014 AFP\n\nSwedish doctors were the first\n\nto successfully perform a uterus transplant in 2013",
