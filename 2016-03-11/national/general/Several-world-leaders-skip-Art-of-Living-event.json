While the Leaders forum is due to be held at a hotel, not at the contested site on the banks of the Yamuna river which has run into trouble with environmental and police clearances, the leaders were expected to attend the cultural festival as well.\n\nThe most public pull-out was that of 92-year-old Zimbabwean ruler Robert Mugabe, who cancelled his visit at the very last minute, even after his departure from Harare had been announced. According to a statement issued in Delhi by Mr. Mugabe\u2019s spokesperson George Charamba, the cancellation followed a \u201ccommunication from organisers of the festival acknowledging substantial inadequacies in protocol and security arrangements around the event.\u201d The statement went on to say that, \u201cA number of leaders slotted for participation, including those from the host country have also withdrawn their participation.\u201d The pointed reference to the \u201chost country\u201d alluded to President Pranab Mukherjee, who was due to give valedictory address at the festival, but conveyed his regrets as he has to attend another function.\n\nWhile AOL officials contacted by The Hindu did not return calls and messages on the Zimbabwean statement, a senior MEA official denied that there was any issue regarding official protocol. \u201cAs head of state on a private visit, Mr. Mugabe and other leaders would all be extended the basic courtesies of protocol,\u201d the official said.\n\nMEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said the \u201cMEA did not invite the President. The invitation was extended entirely by the Sri Sri Ravishankar Foundation.\u201d Perhaps the fact that there was no presidential participation was the reason for the cancellation, he added.\n\nDiplomatic officials said Sri Lankan President Sirisena had to pullout due to \u201chealth issues,\u201d Nepal President Bidhiya Devi had \u201ctechnical issues,\u201d and former President Karzai had to return urgently to Kabul due to a \u201csudden engagement.\u201d The Hindu was able to find out that Nepal\u2019s Foreign Minister Kamal Thapa, former Bhutan Prime Minister Jigme Thinley, Sri Lankan Parliamentary Speaker Jayasuriya, Pakistani leader Sherry Rehman and several members of the European Parliament and a \u201ccrown prince from the UAE\u201d would attend, but The Hindu could not confirm their participation from their missions.",
