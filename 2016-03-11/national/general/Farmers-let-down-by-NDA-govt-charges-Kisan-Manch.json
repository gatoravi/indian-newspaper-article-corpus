    "text": "Thousands of farmers from across the country under the Bhartiya Kisan Manch (BKM) \u2014 a platform of 13 farm organisations \u2014 staged a protest on Thursday, accusing the NDA government of adopting an anti-farmer policy.\n\n\u201cFarmers are committing suicides across the country but government is trying to comfort us with a promise of doubling our income in the next five years,\u201d said BKM president Satnam Singh Behru, adding that \u201cfarmers need an immediate relief... they can\u2019t wait for five years.\u201d\n\nHe said during the 2014 elections, the BJP made big promises for farmers\u2019 welfare but nothing concrete had been done yet. \u201cFarmers are fighting for survival and if the government doesn\u2019t address our issues soon we will be compelled to start a nation-wide agitation,\u201d he added.\n\nSeeks bailout package\n\n\u201cIn 2015, we have seen an unprecedented spurt in farmers\u2019 suicides, most of them due to farm debts. Government should immediately give a financial bailout package as relief measure to save farmers\u2019 lives,\u201d Mr. Behru said.\n\nAddressing the farmers, Bhartiya Kisan Union (A) president Rishipal Ambawata said the government had neither given an assurance on increasing the minimum support price (MSP) nor on reducing input costs.\n\nThe farmers are reeling under acute agrarian crisis mainly due to poor prices of agro produce. \u201cFarmers have been hoping that the government would announce a higher MSP as promised by the BJP in its poll manifesto, but farmers are still waiting,\u201d Mr. Ambawata said.\n\nHe said that if their demands were not met within a month, a nationwide agitation would be launched.\n\n\u2018Farmers are committing suicide but government is trying to comfort us with promises\u2019",
