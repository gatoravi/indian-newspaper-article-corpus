Who among the three, or all of them, make the final cut depends on them clearing the advanced stage training.\n\nThis was announced by the Chief of the Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Arup Raha on Tuesday while speaking on the occasion of the International Women\u2019s Day. \u201cI must thank the Defence Minister for having approved the IAF\u2019s proposal to induct women as fighter pilots and very soon on June 18 this year, Indian Air Force will get its first woman fighter pilot,\u201d ACM Raha said, addressing a seminar on the role of women in the Army\u2019s Medical Corps.\n\nThe three women trainees have volunteered to join the fighter stream. \u201cThey are under the second phase of their training. Once they complete their training they will be on par with their male colleagues and the passing out parade is scheduled on June 18,\u201d the ACM added.\n\nIn October the Defence Ministry, in a much welcomed decision, had announced that women would for the first time be allowed in combat roles beginning with the Air Force. Soon the Navy followed suit saying that women pilots would be inducted except where staying overnight on board was involved.",
