The rival BJP has fielded Sarbananda Sonowal, a former Congressman, who belongs to the ST community, as its chief ministerial candidate.\n\nSources in Congress said that the party high command had given up on the idea of canvassing support in the tribal belt of Assam since Mr. Sonowal exerts strong influence there.\n\nAjit Jogi, the chairman of the Congress ST cell told The Hindu that he had been receiving phone calls from Assam ever since the party finalised its screening committee. \u201cI will find out how it [non-inclusion of ST member] happened,\u201d said Mr. Jogi, adding that he would reach Delhi on March 12 to discuss the matter with the party high command.\n\nHowever, senior leader Janardan Dwivedi defended the committee saying that the \u201cformula\u201d for electing a \u201ccentral level\u201d screening body was different from that for a State election committee.",
