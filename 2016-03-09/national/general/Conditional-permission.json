    "text": "Advocate Rajeev Bansal, appearing for the DDA, which had previously maintained that AOL had not disclosed to them the exact scale of the event, maintained that permission for the event was granted \u201cwith conditions that no permanent construction will be permitted without permission from the competent authority.\u201d\n\nHe said the plea seeking stay of construction activity was filed much after activity to hold the event had started and it needed to be dismissed.\n\n\u201cAs for the debris at the site, we would like to state that a constant watch is being maintained to ensure that the Yamuna floodplains are safe. There is a contractor to remove the debris, if any is dumped,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bansal said. To this the Bench said there were photographs to show the presence of waste at the site.\n\nThe DDA, however, maintained that when the site was handed over the organisers, there was no debris.\n\nIn its submission, AOL maintained that they started work at the site after taking permission from all the authorities. This was refuted by the Delhi Police and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. AOL was also unable to give the court the exact number of people expected for the event.\n\nThe matter has been adjourned for Wednesday.",
