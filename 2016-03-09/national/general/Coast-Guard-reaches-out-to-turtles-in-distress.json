The personnel do this while on regular patrol and the regular surveillance is not affected,\u201d Inspector General Satya Prakash Sharma, Regional Commander (East), ICG, said.\n\nIn a recent incident, ICGS Vishwast, which was patrolling off the Andhra Pradesh coast, spotted a floating net with some movement. It was found four Olive Ridley sea turtles were entangled in the net.\n\nThe personnel on board the ship lowered a boat and cut the nylon net without inflicting harm to the turtles.\n\nICGS Abheek on patrol off the Palk Bay sighted turtles entangled in a fishing net, which they rescued and released into the sea.\n\nVarious agencies take efforts to protect turtles and their nests, sometimes save them from dense fishing activity in the sea.\n\n\u201cCoast Guard has been coordinating with other agencies like the Forest Department in Odisha coast to protect turtles. We are planning to coordinate with agencies here too,\u201d Mr. Sharma said.\n\nCoast Guard is also educating fishermen to use Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in their nets to avoid catching them while fishing.\n\nThe personnel rescue them\n\nfrom nets during regular\n\nsurveillance",
