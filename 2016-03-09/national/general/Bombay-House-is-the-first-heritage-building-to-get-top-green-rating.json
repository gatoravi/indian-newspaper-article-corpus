    "text": "Bombay House, the Tata group\u2019s headquarters, on Tuesday became the first heritage building in India to be awarded a platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC).\n\nThe building won under the EB (Existing Building) rating system for implementing measurable strategies and solutions in five categories: site & facility management, water efficiency, energy efficiency, health & comfort and innovation.\n\nThe 93-year-old building improved its energy savings by 35 per cent since 2010, after smart retrofits like waterless urinals and smart metering, installing solar photo-voltaics, a segregated waste management policy, and a green policy to promote conservation of resources. The Tata group has also implemented a continuous measurement and verification system that has led to savings in power, water, and other resources. Much of the work was implemented in-house, with The Associated Building Company Limited (ABCL), a Tata group company, responsible for the building, and Ecofirst Services, the sustainability arm of Tata Consulting Engineers Limited, which works in the area of building retro commissioning and facilitation.\n\nThe ICBC launched its Green Existing Buildings ratings system to encourage sustainability practices, and prioritise green concepts and techniques for water and energy efficiency, reduction in use of fossil fuels, and conservation of natural ressources.\n\nThe Tata group\u2019s HQ won a platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council for sustainable practices",
