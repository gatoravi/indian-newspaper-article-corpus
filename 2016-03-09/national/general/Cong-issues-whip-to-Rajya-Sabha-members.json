    "text": "The Congress has issued a three-line whip to its members in the Rajya Sabha to be present when Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers his reply to the Motion of Thanks to the President's address .\n\nAccording to top sources in the party, the whip was issued for two reasons. \u201cWe want to be in full force when Mr. Modi is speaking since he does take a dig at the Opposition for not being present and more importantly, if at the end of the reply we are not offered clarifications on his reply (a privilege available to Rajya Sabha members) then an amendment to the motion of thanks will be moved,\u201d said a senior MP. Last year, CPI(M) MPs Sitaram Yechury and P. Rajeeve had moved and got cleared an amendment to the Motion of Thanks on the black money issue.",
