    "text": "Actor-turned-MLA Nandamuri Balakrishna, whose comments about women at a recent audio function of the film Savitri raked up a controversy, clarified about the incident in the Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nHe recalled the initiatives his father, the legendary NTR, had taken for women\u2019s empowerment, protection of the girl child and his efforts towards taking forward the proposal of 33 per cent reservation.\n\n\u201cSeveral of my films have those embedded in the storyline and have reflected the enormous respect I have for women,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I must tell you that at the audio function, I had to speak as two individuals, as a man with two professions and responsibilities. I had to keep in mind that I am a member of the Legislative Assembly and spoke of women\u2019s empowerment. Then, I had also to keep the adoration and adulation of my fans and speak the way they would like me to speak,\u201d he said, adding a line about how he was misunderstood by the media.\n\nThe MLA went on to urge Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao to have an independent survey conducted outside the House, with women from a cross-section of society to establish he indeed had loads of respect for them.",
