    "text": "The U.S. on Monday expressed disappointment over India denying visas to members of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).\n\nA USCIRF team was planning to travel to India on March 4, but India did not process their visa applications. The Indian embassy in Washington said there was no change in India\u2019s policy with respect to such visits and saw no \u201clocus standi of a foreign entity like the USCIRF to pass its judgment and comment on the state of Indian citizens\u2019 constitutionally protected rights.\u201d\n\nIndia has been denying visas to USCIRF for seven years now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by this news,\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said, and added that religious freedom in India had been a \u201ctopic of conversation between the two countries.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a topic of conversation that we\u2019re afraid to have with our Indian counterparts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are supportive of the commission and the important role they play in reviewing facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom around the world. As President Obama himself noted during his visit last year, we support the Government of India\u2019s commitments \u2014 commitment to promoting religious freedom and diversity,\u201d he said. \u201cOur nations are stronger when every person has the right to practise the faith they choose, or to practise no faith at all\u2026,\u201d Mr. Obama had said.",
