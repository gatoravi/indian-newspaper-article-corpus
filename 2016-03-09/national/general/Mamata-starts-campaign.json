Along with the Trinamool Congress chairperson, who is contesting from Bhawanipore, Women and Child Development Minister Sashi Panja, Minister for Housing and Youth Affairs Arup Biswas and Vaishali Dalmiya, daughter of cricket administrator, the late Jagmohan Dalmiya, participated in the march.\n\nAfter walking for a brief stretch, Ms. Banerjee paid floral tributes to the statue of Swami Vivekananda at his ancestral house. Ms. Banerjee concluded the rally by raising the slogans that she had coined last week. \u2014 Shiv Sahay Singh",
