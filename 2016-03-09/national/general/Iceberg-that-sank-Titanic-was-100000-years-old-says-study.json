According to Mr. Bigg, it was around 1,700 feet long and 75m tonnes in weight. Mr. Bigg\u2019s research suggests 1912 was a bad year, with icebergs reported floating much further south than normal.\n\n\u201cThe presence of extensive ice was widely reported prior to and following the collision,\u201d Mr. Bigg wrote in his new book, Icebergs .\n\nHe said why the number reaching shipping lanes should vary so much from year to year is unclear, because so many factors \u2014 wind direction, sea currents and temperature changes \u2014 are involved.\n\nOne idea is that the Titanic iceberg broke from its glacier in 1908 when a mild winter accelerated melting and floated south during the much colder winter of 1911-12. \u2014 PTI",
