When Mercury was very young, much of the planet was likely so hot that there was a global \u201cocean\u201d of molten magma.\n\nScientists have suggested that as this magma ocean cooled, most minerals that solidified sank, except graphite, which would have been buoyant and floated to form the original crust of Mercury.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Geoscience . \u2014 PTI",
