Sridhar said the Himachal Pradesh government was on board for the cricket match. The statement assumes significance as Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had opposed the match and even told a visiting Pakistani team a day ago that the State government would not provide any security to the cricket team. Mr. Singh had said he was opposed to the match as a mark of respect for the two martyrs from the State killed in an operation at the Pathankot airbase in January.\n\n\u201cThe match is on. The State and Central governments are on board and all security arrangements have been made,\u201d Mr. Sridhar said after a meeting with M.K Singla, Special Secretary (Internal Security) in the Home Ministry.\n\nCM changes stand\n\nGiving the go-ahead for the match, the Himachal Chief Minister on Tuesday said he was \u201cnot against the game of cricket.\u201d Talking to media persons after presenting the State Budget, Mr. Singh, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the sentiments of a large number of ex-servicemen and martyrs\u2019 families who are against the India-Pakistan match after the cross-border anti-India activities conducted by the neighbouring country in which soldiers from the hill State have lost their lives.\u201d\n\n(With additional reporting by Kanwar Yogendra in Shimla)",
