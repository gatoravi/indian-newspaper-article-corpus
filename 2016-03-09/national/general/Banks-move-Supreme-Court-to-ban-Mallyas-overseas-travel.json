    "text": "The banks told the Supreme Court that the threat to their financial interests were so immediate and grave that the High Court should have passed the interim order without first hearing the embattled industrialist and others, including the debtor firm Kingfisher Airlines Limited.\n\n\u201cThe High Court of Karnataka, at Bengaluru, by its impugned order has failed to protect the interests of the petitioner banks who are yet to recover an amount in excess of Rs. 9,000 crore from the respondents,\u201d the banks said.\n\nThe banks want the Supreme Court to pass an interim order to freeze Mr. Mallya\u2019s passport or direct him not to leave the jurisdiction of this country without the court\u2019s permission.\n\nBefore moving the High Court, the banks had filed four pleas in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in Bengaluru, seeking freezing of Mr. Mallya\u2019s passport, an arrest warrant against him and issuance of a \u201cgarnishee order against Respondent Nos. 10 [Diageo Plc] and 11 (United Spirits Limited) from disbursing $75 million.\u201d They had also sought a directive that Mr. Mallya disclose his assets on oath.\n\nThe DRT had heard arguments on only one plea and did not consider the other pleas related to freezing of the passport and restraining Mr. Mallya from leaving country, the banks said in their appeal.\n\nThe banks had moved the DRT in the backdrop of Mr. Mallya\u2019s recent resignation from the chairmanship of United Spirits. Diageo Plc, the current owner of the liquor company, has agreed to pay Mr. Mallya $75 million (roughly Rs. 515 crore) as severance package.",
