    "text": "Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya on Tuesday said that the government\u2019s intention behind announcing a tax on withdrawal of Employees\u2019 Provident Fund savings was to offer better returns on investments in the National Pension Scheme, but the two retirement savings instruments could not be compared.\n\nIt is learnt that the Labour Ministry took a strong stand with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and said in a note that the proposal would hit the salaried class which was the core constituency of the government, and that the tax would only yield around Rs. 300 crore from 42 lakh workers.\n\n\u201cThe announcement was made with the intent of getting better returns in NPS. After the stakeholders and we got in touch with the Ministry of Finance, then a discussion took place (where) we said that both the NPS and EPF can\u2019t be compared because NPS is only for pension and EPF is a provident fund scheme\u201d, Mr. Dattatreya told The Hindu in an exclusive interview. Mr. Dattatreya said Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had made himself a \u201claughing stock\u201d by claiming that his pressure had led to the withdrawal of the proposal. The Minister said he had met Prime Minister on Tuesday and said the decision to withdraw the EPF tax proposal was in the interest of workers.\n\n(For full interview visit: bit.ly/1W6CM6G)",
