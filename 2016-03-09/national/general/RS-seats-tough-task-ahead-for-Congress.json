    "text": "As 17 Congress MPs are retiring from the Rajya Sabha in the next three months, the party high command is meticulously choosing their replacements keeping in view the upcoming Assembly elections.\n\nThe vacancies in the upper House have triggered competition among the Congress leaders. And the party high command is aware that the party may face a blowback if they induct wrong candidates from the poll-bound States. With Ashwini Kumar\u2019s membership from poll-bound Punjab coming to an end, the State president Captain Amarinder Singh submitted the list of nominations to Sonia Gandhi. Sources said that Ms. Gandhi has decided to select either a Dalit leader or a Jat Sikh.\n\nSimilarly, in Assam, where the elections are due in April, Anjan Dutta, the State Congress president, told The Hindu that he has nominated 12 leaders for the two vacant Rajya Sabha seats. \u201cWe have strongly recommended Apurba Bhattacharya,\u201d he said. The first sign of older leadership retaining their posts became visible when Anand Sharma gave up his membership from Rajasthan to contest from Himachal Pradesh.",
