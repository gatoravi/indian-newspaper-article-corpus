    "text": "The global market for tablet computers will see another decline in 2016, but one bright spot is in \"detachables\" which are gaining as PC replacements, researchers said Tuesday.\n\nA report by research firm IDC said tablet sales worldwide are likely to slip 5.9 percent this year to 195 million units, following a drop of 10 percent in 2015.\n\nBut even as the \"slate\" tablet market cools from its once red-hot pace, one key growth segment is detachables, which bodes well for Microsoft and makers of other Windows-based devices. IDC projected a 73 percent jump in detachable tablet sales this year. New entrants like Alcatel and Huawei are coming into this segment. \u2014 AFP",
