Ambedkar \u2014 who was also India\u2019s first Law Minister \u2014 had indeed burnt the document, associating it with inequality, it was in sync with the radical Dalit politics he espoused.\n\nBut this time the challenge comes from within Hindutva \u2014 which finds Hindu traditions to be meaningful \u2014 though the challengers are already marginal within and seem to be on the verge of staging an exit.\n\nPresent with Jatin Goraya, the JNU ABVP unit vice-president, who is a Dalit from Haryana, were Pradeep Narwal and other students who have moved away from ABVP since the arrest of JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar \u2014 out on bail now \u2014 under sedition law. Clearly, young Dalit leaders who had associated with Hindutva\u2019s Dalit outreach seem to have moved away ideologically as the ABVP has clashed with the Ambedkar Students\u2019 Association at Hyderabad University \u2014 where Rohith Vemula committed suicide \u2014 and with the Left union at the JNU.\n\n\u201cThese are contradictions between Hindutva and Dalits surfacing in the wake of recent controversies. Hindutva does not know how much to shift its line to accommodate Dalits, who are also Ambedkarites. And young Dalits also cannot adapt to it beyond a point. This contradiction is already playing out in this case,\u201d said Badri Narayan, who teaches social exclusion at the university.\n\nProf. Narayan says caste as an institution is a prime impediment to the growth of Hindutva and the contradictions between the two are beginning to surface.\n\nMr. Narwal told The Hindu that Mr. Goraya would quit the ABVP if the organisation did not condemn the Manu Smriti, widely seen as an \u201canti-Dalit\u201d and \u201canti-women\u201d text.\n\nThe Sangh Parivar, however, seems to be playing down this incident at the JNU for the moment.\n\nABVP Dalit leader burns \u2018Manu Smriti\u2019 which is seen as\n\nan \u2018anti-Dalit\u2019,\n\n\u2018anti-women\u2019 text",
