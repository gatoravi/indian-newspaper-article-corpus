    "text": "As mercury rises across Kerala and hovers around a 37 degree to 39 degree Celsius, loss of drug potency owing to possible poor cold chain maintenance is a major cause for concern.\n\nKerala Pharmacists Organisation secretary M.P. Premji says there is specific temperature level for various drugs. Otherwise, they can turn non-efficacious.\n\nInsulin for diabetics is to be stored in a refrigerator at 2 degree to 8 degree Celsius. (During use by diabetics, insulin types such as human mixtard can be kept in temperature up to 25 degree Celsius). The temperature for various oral drugs ranges from 20 degree to 30 degree Celsius, he says.\n\nMr. Premji alleged that the cold chain breaks when wholesalers provide the drugs to retailers. \u201cDrugs should be packed in polystyrene boxes and transported in air-conditioned vehicles to the retailer. But, this does not happen in many cases,\u201d he says.\n\nErnakulam District president of All Kerala Chemists and Drugs Association P.V. Tomy, however, asserts that there is no problem during transportation to retailers because drug firms check periodically whether the cold chain is maintained.\n\nMr. Premji says the risk is highest at the retail points. Many of these shops are small \u2014 of 150 sq ft to 200 sq ft \u2014 have poor ventilation and may be only one refrigerator. Power cuts in summer can make things worse, especially if there is no generator to power the refrigerator, he points out.\n\nAssistant Drugs Controller in Kozhikode P.N. Jayan says this can serve as an alert though no complaints have been made in recent times. \u201cWe can ask our field staff to check whether everything is in order.\u201d",
