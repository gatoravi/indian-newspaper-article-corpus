The list did not include any of 116 seats that Left Front had announced candidates for on Monday, indicating that a formal \u201cunderstanding\u201d between the Left Front and the Congress was in place.\n\nReleasing a list of 116 candidates, Left Front chairperson Biman Basu said on Monday that they had entered into an \u201celectoral understanding\u201d with the Congress, which is not \u201can alliance or a Front.\u201d\n\nWBPCC President Ahir Ranjan Chowdhury also clarified that while the Left and the Congress have entered into a \u201cseat sharing arrangement\u201d, they are not in a formal alliance with a common minimum agenda. Mr Chowdhury pulled no punches to clarify that he was not happy about an arrangement which was \u201chalf-hearted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we would have come together properly and conducted a joint campaigns the result would have been much better. But some of them [Front members] have problems with us, though we [Congress] do not believe in political untouchability,\u201d he said. Without naming the Left Front chairperson, Mr Chowdhury said there was \u201cno point playing hide-and-seek game when the talks between the two parties are [taking place] in full media glare.\u201d\n\nNo candidates yet\n\nOn why the Congress only announced the seats and not the candidates, Mr Chowdhury said the decision on selection of candidates would be taken by All India Congress Committee in Delhi.\n\nHowever, Mr. Chowdhury declared one candidate, albeit unofficially.",
