The Pakistan SIT is due to visit India in connection with an ongoing probe.\n\nLast week, the Air Force chief, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, had said that the force would have no objection if the Pakistan SIT wanted to visit the air base.\n\nA senior government official said that the final decision would be taken by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) and the National Security Advisor (NSA) would also have a say in it.\n\nA few days ago, the NIA was asked for its opinion on the Pakistan SIT\u2019s visit to the air base. \u201cThe area of operation, where the four terrorists were gunned down and the Airmen\u2019s Billet, which was blown up, are located at the periphery of the air base. The defence installations are much inside and it is highly unlikely that the security of the airbase would be compromised\u201d, said the official.\n\nThe NIA\u2019s decision assumes significance as India and Pakistan have renewed attempts to share real time information on terrorist groups. Last week, Pakistan NSA Naseer Khan Janjua informed his Indian counterpart that 10 Pakistan-based terrorists could have sneaked into India through the Gujarat coast. Following this information, a country-wide alert was issued and security agencies were pressed into action to further tackle the situation.\n\nThe Pakistan SIT is expected to visit India around March 20, an official said. Based on information provided by India, a case has been registered in Pakistan regarding the Pathankot attack and three persons have been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe area of operation is still being preserved. We might need to access it again as part of the ongoing investigations. We have identified all the four terrorists who entered the airbase and have already sent their photographs to Pakistan with the letter rogatory,\u201d said the official.\n\nSeveral people in the security establishment are apprehensive of the Pakistan team\u2019s visit.\n\nThe attack on the air base by six terrorists from Pakistan on January 2 went on for five days and claimed the lives of seven security personnel.",
