The Centre should pull all stops to ensure that the soldiers\u2019 voices are heard loud and clear during election results, the court said.\n\n\u201cParamount importance should be given to the voting rights of armed forces personnel serving in far-flung areas of the country\u201d, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, and directed the Centre to finalise a fool-proof mechanism to ensure that their postal ballots reached authorities in time so that these soldier do not feel left out in the country\u2019s democratic process.\n\nWhen Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand tried to assure the court that India\u2019s postal service was \u201cthe best in the world\u201d, Justice Gogoi replied, \u201cI will not comment on that. But we think something more proficient than postal (service) is required here. Post is a little outdated\u201d.\n\nCentre directed to ensure that their postal ballots reach the authorities\n\non time",
