Farmers are committing suicide in a prosperous State which was known to feed the country,\u201d said Mr.Kejriwal at the AAP rally that is being seen as the beginning of the party\u2019s election campaign in the State.\n\nHe said it was time to uproot the SAD-BJP government and end corruption. \u201cI am not scared of the Badals. Even if I have to lay down my life for the sake of Punjab, I will not step back,\u201d he said, accusing the government of sheltering those who were involved in drug trafficking and corruption.\n\nMr.Kejriwal also accused the SAD-BJP of ignoring the concerns of farmers. \u201cWhen we (AAP) come to power, we won\u2019t let the farmers end their lives,\u201d he said\n\nWith the AAP jumping into the election fray, the political contest in Punjab is all set to become a three-cornered one, involving the Congress and SAD-BJP alliance.\n\nBadal\u2019s appeal\n\nAt a rally organised by the SAD-BJP combine in Muktsar, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal urged the people to elect the SAD-BJP alliance government for the third consecutive term, based on the development work done during the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s due to the pro-people and development-oriented policies of the State government that Punjab is on the path of progress. And this could be sustained only if the SAD-BJP alliance is voted to power again,\u201d said Mr.Badal, alleging that the AAP was trying to grab power by misleading Punjabis.\n\n\u201cLeaders of the AAP are basically braggers who are trying to divert the attention of the people from basic issues,\u201d he said.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal said the Congress was nowhere in the picture in the upcoming elections and even the elevation of Captain Amarinder Singh to the post of Punjab Pradesh Congress chief would not make a difference.\n\nCongress rally\n\nAt the rally conducted by the Congress, Capt. Singh said it was only the Congress that could provide a stable, clean and efficient government.\n\nHe said: \u201cPunjab needs an efficient and experienced government which can retrieve the State from the social, economic and political mess the Akalis have consigned it to.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned the people against the alluring promises made by the AAP, saying the party had already failed in Delhi and not fulfilled even a single election promise so far.",
