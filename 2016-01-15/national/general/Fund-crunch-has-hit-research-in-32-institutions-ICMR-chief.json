But, we received only 50 per cent of the budget allocation we requested. Many of our projects are not on track and I am hopeful that the current budget session will address the issue,\u201d she said during a media interaction.\n\nDr. Swaminathan said that scientific organisations needed to be empowered to become globally competitive.\n\n\u201cResource crunch affects in many different ways. A research institute should always have cutting edge technology. If we are working with outdated equipment and facility, and if things are not available on time, we cannot be globally competitive,\u201d she said.\n\nManagerial delays were affecting scientific innovations and experiments, she alleged.\n\n\u201cIt takes six months to get a reagent while in the West, you get it in one day. By the time a scientist starts doing an experiment, it is already done and published somewhere else. We cannot compete with the world unless we change the way in which we use science. Financial and managerial flexibility for research organisations is the need of the hour,\u201d Dr.Swaminathan said.\n\nSpeaking about the lack of credible baseline data informing the vector-borne disease control policy, she said that the institute was working towards an elimination programme that would factor in the discrepancies in data.\n\n\u201cThe policy framework is based on the official data, which we admit suffers from under-reporting. But we have to depend on the data available with the programme implementers. However, we are cognizant of the gross under-reporting. The idea is to launch a better surveillance programme as we work towards the target of malaria elimination,\u201d said Neena Valecha, National Institute of Malaria Research.",
