    "text": "Ever wondered how you can recall a recent event in a fraction of the time it took you to live it? Scientists may have the answer.\n\nResearchers have discovered a mechanism that may explain how the brain remembers nearly all of what happened on a recent afternoon \u2014 or make a thorough plan for how to spend an upcoming afternoon \u2014 in a fraction of the time it takes to live out the experience.\n\nThe new mechanism compresses information needed for memory retrieval, imagination or planning and encodes it on a brain wave frequency that is separate from the one used for recording real-time experiences.\n\nBrain cells share different kinds of information with one another using a variety of different brain waves, analogous to the way radio stations broadcast on different frequencies.\n\nResearchers found that one of these frequencies allows us to play back memories \u2014 or envision future activities \u2014 in fast forward. \u2014 PTI",
