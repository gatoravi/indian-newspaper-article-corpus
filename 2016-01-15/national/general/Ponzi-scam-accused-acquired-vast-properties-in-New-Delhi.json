Investigations are under way to identify the properties acquired by the accused company and its office bearers in other parts of the country,\u201d the official said.\n\nHeld on duping charge\n\nAbout a week ago, the CBI had arrested Bhangoo and his associates: Sukhdev Singh, Gurmeet Singh and Subrata Bhattacharya, for their alleged involvement in duping 5.5 crore investors of Rs.45,000 crore on the promise of allotting agricultural land and phenomenal returns.\n\nThe Supreme Court had last April ordered sale of all the assets of the Pearls Group of companies for paying back the dues to the investors. Accordingly, a special committee was set up to oversee the sale of the immovable assets and liquidation of fixed deposits of the companies for the purpose. In August 2014, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had directed the group companies to return the money to the investors, ordering immediate shutting down of their collective investment schemes.",
