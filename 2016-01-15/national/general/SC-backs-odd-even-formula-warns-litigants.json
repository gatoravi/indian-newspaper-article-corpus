Thakur said the pilot project had to be promoted and even Supreme Court judges had done their bit by carpooling among themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are carpooling... the government is trying to curb pollution. People are dying due to pollution and you are challenging it for publicity.... This is a publicity stunt,\u201d Chief Justice Thakur told B. Badrinath, a lawyer, who had moved the court against the recent Delhi High Court decision not to intervene in the issue. The Bench even threatened to impose heavy costs against such moves.\n\nIt advised citizens that individual concerns and discomforts had to be laid aside for the common good. But the court said the government and the Delhi Metro should act to make commuting easier by increasing the number of public buses and adding more coaches to metro trains in order to help people who leave their cars at home.\n\nThe AAP government\u2019s odd-even project was implemented on January 1 for 15 days.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s observations, on the eve of the last day of the implementation of the policy, are significant as a debate is currently on as to whether the scheme should be repeated or not.\n\nThe High Court recently decided that judicial intervention was unwarranted on the December 28, 2015, notification.\n\nThe High Court had reasoned that the policy was implemented for a limited period and to ascertain if there would be reduction in air pollution by reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. The policy allows odd numbered cars to ply on odd dated days and even numbered ones on even dated days.",
