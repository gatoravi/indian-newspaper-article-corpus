The legislator representing the Gudalur constituency, Dravida Mani, also joined the protest.\n\nThe agitated protesters refused to allow the officials remove the victims\u2019 body. Efforts by the Additional Superintendents to pacify the crowd went in vain. This affected traffic for nearly two hours.\n\nAs the protest continued and the crowd swelled, police resorted to the use of force to disperse them leading to mild tension.\n\nLater, the police sent the body of Anish to Gudalur Government Hospital for post-mortem.\n\nThe protesters urged the officials to bring in a permanent solution to the issue and not ad-hoc interim solutions.
