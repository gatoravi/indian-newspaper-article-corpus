After getting bail, he was again arrested on the outskirts of Kaithal by Haryana Police.\n\nHe termed the action as something that was never expected. \u201cThe experience was traumatic and sad. It was quite sudden,\u201d he said.\n\nKiku asserted that his intention was not to hurt any religious group or anybody.\n\n\u201cWhen the intention is clear, it is sad the way things had to happen where I had to suddenly go to Haryana and get a bail from the court,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said summons was not issued to him. \u201cIf I had the summons in my hand, I would have given it to my lawyer. I was informed on Twitter that there is some case filed against me, which I also somehow didn\u2019t take very seriously because I thought maybe someone was trying to scare me on Twitter. So, I didn\u2019t really check. I wish I had,\u201d he said. \u2014 PTI",
