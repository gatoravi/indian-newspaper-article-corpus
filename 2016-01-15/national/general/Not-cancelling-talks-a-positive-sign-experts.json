    "text": "As the Foreign Secretary talks between India and Pakistan stand postponed, the foreign ministries in Delhi and Islamabad denied any meeting between the National Security Advisers had taken place in Dubai on Thursday, as had been widely speculated.\n\nThe decision to put off the talks effectively puts into limbo the newly restarted dialogue process that had been kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif meeting in Paris on November 30. Even so, experts on both sides said the fact that they had not been cancelled should be seen as a positive sign.\n\n\u201cPostponement of Foreign Secretary-level talks is not going to impact anything because the postponement is not indefinite and both sides have agreed to continue with the dialogue,\u201d said former Foreign Minister Natwar Singh.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu from Islamabad, former diplomat Ashraf Jehangir Qazi said, \u201cIt is noteworthy that both sides stayed in touch with each other after the Pathankot attack and sustained mutual trust which shows that the talks are on track and the terrorists did not succeed. Obviously, sometime is needed to recover from the after effects of the attack and the postponement will help.\u201d\n\nThe postponement decision had been expected on Wednesday night, when Mr. Modi convened a meeting with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar. However officials said they decided to wait for the return of National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. The Congress asked why the Prime Minister had been unable to take the decision himself. \u201cDoes this mean that PM Modi had given all responsibility to the National Security Adviser,\u201d asked Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh.",
