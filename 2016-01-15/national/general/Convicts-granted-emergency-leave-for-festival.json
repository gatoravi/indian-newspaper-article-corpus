    "text": "For a select group of 140 convicts lodged in the Tiruchi Central Prison, the Pongal festivities will truly be a memorable one.\n\nIt will be happy reunion with their family members, albeit for a limited number of days to celebrate the festival.\n\nA festive atmosphere permeated the sprawling jail complex on Thursday morning as delighted prisoners stepped out to celebrate Pongal with their kin at their homes. They were granted emergency leave by the prison authorities.\n\nThe emergency leave was granted to 140 convicts with a majority of them being lifers, Superintendent of Prison, Tiruchi, A. Murugesan told The Hindu . The emergency leave was granted to them upon obtaining report from the Probation Officers concerned after the convicts applied for it sometime ago. The convicts were serving life sentence for having committed murder. Most of the convicts granted emergency leave belong to different districts in the central zone.\n\nFour among them are senior citizens. A majority of the convicts who were granted leave had spent over 10 years in the jail. The convicts had been given six days to return to the Central Prison, Mr. Murugesan said.\n\nEach one of them was given a dhoti, sari, towel, a kg of rice and sugar, ghee, cardamom, cashewnut, dry grapes and a sugar cane.",
