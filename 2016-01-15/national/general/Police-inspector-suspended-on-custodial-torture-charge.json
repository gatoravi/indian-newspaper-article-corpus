    "text": ": Even as Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday asked a gathering of policemen to create an atmosphere where citizens could approach police stations with hope rather than fear, Director General of Police K.B. Singh suspended a woman officer in connection with the custodial torture of a minor boy in Hirakud a few months ago.\n\nMr. Singh ordered the suspension of Inspector-in-charge Savitri Bal, hours after Sambalpur Superintendent of Police Akhileshvar Singh attached her to the district headquarters police station.\n\nIt is alleged that the 15 year-old boy, who was taken into custody on the charge of stealing a mobile phone, was kept in the police station for three days and brutally tortured before being released after a bribe of Rs. 6000 was paid by his mother.",
