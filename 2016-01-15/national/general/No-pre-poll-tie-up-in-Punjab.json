    "text": "Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday cleared speculation that the party will not enter into any pre-poll alliance in Punjab. The Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) had reportedly proposed an alliance in the agrarian State after the success of a grand alliance in Bihar and there were reports that PPCC members had even tried to meet AAP\u2019s Punjab unit to discuss the possibility.\n\nThe AAP members, however, said they have never had anything to do with the Congress. \u201cWe are not allying with anyone. The AAP has nothing to do with the Congress and going by Thursday\u2019s rally response, one can measure the strength of the party in Punjab,\u201d said Ashish Talwar, political advisor to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe State will go to the polls in early 2017.\n\nHowever, the AAP did form the government in Delhi with the Congress\u2019 outside support for 49-days after the 2013 Assembly elections. Party sources said going into with an alliance had hit the party\u2019s image in the past. \u201cWhen AAP formed the government with the Congress in Delhi, it didn\u2019t go down well with people. Recently, when Arvind Kejriwal shared the stage with Lalu Prasad in Bihar, political rivals used it as an opportunity,\u201d said an AAP leader.\n\nBut with the report of infighting within the AAP\u2019s Punjab unit rife, the party had to dispatch leaders of the Delhi unit to oversee the campaigning in Punjab. After Delhi, the AAP has a strong voter base in Punjab as all the four MPs from the party are from the State. Though the party in August suspended two of its MPs over anti-party activities, but Mr. Talwar maintained that the party is going strong in Punjab.",
