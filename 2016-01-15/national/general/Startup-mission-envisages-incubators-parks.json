About 90 of these are in educational institutions, with virtually all the old IITs and IIMs covered,\u201d said Harkesh Mittal, adviser and head of the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board.\n\nSteady climb\n\n\u201cThe number of IIT/IIM graduates looking to start their own ventures has gone from two per cent a few years ago to nearly 10 per cent now, but we need to take this movement to our other educational institutions as well,\u201d Mr. Mittal told The Hindu .\n\nAs per the plan, the HRD Ministry and the Science and Technology Ministry would share the costs for setting up startup centres in these institutions, which would need around 5,000 square feet space and cost around Rs. 50 lakh a year.\n\nThe Start Up India mission to be unveiled on Saturday envisages technology business incubators and research parks. The Science and Technology Ministry would bear 100 per cent cost to set up business incubators in institutes like NITs. Each incubator would work with 20 budding ventures, and be spread over 10,000 sq.ft. The cost of each incubator is expected to be in the range of Rs. 5 crore to Rs. 10 crore. Separately, research parks like the one at IIT Madras would be set up in a handful of institutes at a cost of Rs. 70 crore to Rs. 100 crore each.",
