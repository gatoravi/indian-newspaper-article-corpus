Bhattacharya, who chairs the committee, said the Union Home Ministry had been intimated about the summons and the item was listed on the agenda of the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe agenda paper has been sent to the government. Now it is their business to inform us,\u201d Mr. Bhattacharya told The Hindu .\n\n\u201cThe Home Secretary has said that since the matter is under investigation by the NIA, it will not be possible to give a complete picture of the matter, but we still feel that the handling of the attack needs to be looked into.\u201d\n\nMr. Bhattacharya said the government had not informed the panel about disinclination, if any, to discuss the issue at this stage.\n\nThe panel has 31 members, of whom 13 are from the Bharatiya Janata Party and four from the Congress.",
