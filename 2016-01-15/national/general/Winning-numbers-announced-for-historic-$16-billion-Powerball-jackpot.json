They can take the winnings in annual payments spread over decades or a smaller amount in a lump sum. The California ticket was sold at a convenience store in Chino Hills, California, lottery spokesman Alex Traverso said.\n\nThe winning ticket in Tennessee was sold in Munford, north of Memphis, according to a news release from lottery officials in that State. Florida lottery officials said the winning ticket for that State was sold at a grocery store in Melbourne Beach.\n\nThe California store immediately became a popular gathering spot. Hundreds of people cheered for TV cameras as if it were New Year\u2019s Eve or a sporting event.\n\nSome took selfies with the store clerk on duty, who became an instant celebrity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud that the ticket was sold here,\u201d the clerk, M. Faroqui, told the local newspaper, the San Bernardino Sun . \u201cI\u2019m very happy. This is very exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 7-Eleven will get a $1 million bonus for selling the winning ticket, Mr. Traverso said. The estimated jackpot amounts had risen steadily since November 4, when it was reset at $40 million. Texas Lottery executive director Gary Grief said this Powerball offered \u201cabsolutely\u201d the world\u2019s biggest jackpot. Powerball tickets are sold in 44 States, as well as the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. \u2014 AP",
