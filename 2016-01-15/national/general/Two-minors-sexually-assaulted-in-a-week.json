The police said that the victim had gone to use the toilet when the accused allegedly entered the toilet and sexually assaulted her at around 8 pm, after which he fled the scene.\n\nThe incident came to light later in the night, when the victim complained of pain in her private parts.The police said that the second case occurred in the Ganpat Patil Nagar area in Borivali (east) on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe victim and the accused know each other well, as they are neighbours, and the victim often visits the accused in his house and spends time there. On Wednesday evening, the victim told her parents that the accused had assaulted her in his house and threatened her with dire consequences if she told anyone about what had happened,\u201d said an officer with the MHB Colony police station.\n\nThe victim\u2019s parents immediately took her to the police station, after which she underwent medical tests at the Bhagwati Hospital in Borivali and a case was registered against the accused. \u201cThe accused has been missing since the incident, and we have formed several teams to track him down,\u201d the officer said.",
