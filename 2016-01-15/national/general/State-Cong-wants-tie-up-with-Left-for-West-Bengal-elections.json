The combine\u2019s victory in West Bengal shall further weaken [the] BJP and it shall have a positive impact on the ongoing revival of the Congress in the country,\u201d the academic-politician said.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Mishra told The Hindu that the Left Front and the Congress \u201cwould not face\u201d any problem as far as sharing of seats are concerned.\n\n\u201cThey [Left Front] will get two-third and we will get one-third and there is no confusion about that,\u201d he said.\n\nRealising that time is running out for both the Left and the Congress to post a serious challenge to the Trinamool Congress, CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra had asked during a public rally if the Congress was \u201cwilling\u201d to have a tie-up.\n\n\u201cOur stand is clear. Remove Trinamool to save Bengal and BJP to save the country. I am asking the State Congress leadership: Are you willing [to join forces with us]?\u201d Mr. Mishra said on Sunday.\n\nHowever, he also underscored the traditional \u201cproblem\u201d of the Congress in his lengthy speech. \u201cI know their [Congress\u2019] problem. They have to wait for the high command\u2019s decision. Talks can be held with everyone but there is not much time left for discussions,\u201d Mr. Mishra warned.\n\nMeanwhile, State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has indicated that he was working overtime for a the alliance.",
