    "text": "Supreme Court is dealing with the loss of public property in the quota agitation led by Hardik Patel in Gujarat.\n\nReferring to the damage caused to public property in the quota agitation that shook Gujarat recently, the Supreme Court on Thursday said a novel mechanism had to be evolved for judiciary to deal with cases involving huge loss of public assets.\n\nA Bench of Justices J.S. Khehar and C. Nagappan sought the assistance of Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi in this aspect. This step came when the Bench was hearing a plea made by quota agitation leader Hardik Patel to quash sedition charges against him.\n\nThe Bench in a previous hearing had made it clear that it would not intervene against the filing of the charge sheet in the case. However, the Bench allowed Mr.Patel\u2019s request for English translation of the charge sheet in the case accusing him of instigating others to kill policemen.\n\nThe Bench asked the Gujarat police to do the needful. It ordered the case for hearing on February 3.\n\nThe court also asked the police to cooperate when Mr. Patel\u2019s side alleged that the police had supplied a password-protected CD of video footage to him without the password.\n\nPolice had lodged the case in October last against 22-year-old Hardik Patel and five of his close aides on the charges of sedition and waging war against the government.",
