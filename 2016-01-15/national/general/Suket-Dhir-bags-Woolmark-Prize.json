I\u2019ve done what I could in India, and this is the best thing that could happen to me, for me to move in a bigger way. I think I\u2019m ready for the world, and I also think the world is ready for me and for this kind of aesthetic. The look is easy and happy, and the world needs that right now,\u201d Mr. Dhir said in a statement.\n\nThe award was judged by a panel that included designer Haider Ackermann, The Business of Fashion founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed, Vogue international editor Suzy Menkes, and the Woolmark Company managing director Stuart McCullough.\n\n\u201cIn fashion, I\u2019m always looking for emotion, for the heartbeat, for the feeling that something excites me \u2014 it may come from an ancient skill but it seems fresh to me,\u201d Mr. Menkes said for Mr. Dhir\u2019s collection.\n\nUsing the traditional technique of hand-tied and dyed yarn ( Ikat ), the collection aims at tracing the mellowed and faded experiences of the past memories through the ombre pattern.
