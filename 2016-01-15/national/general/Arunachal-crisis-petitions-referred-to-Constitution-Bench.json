    "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday referred to a Constitution Bench a batch of petitions arising out of certain orders passed by the Gauhati High Court in the ongoing political battle in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nA Bench comprising Justices J.S. Khehar and C. Nagappan said the matters pertained to constitutional provisions on the rights of the Governor, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker and hence needed to be decided by a larger Bench.\n\nLawyers\u2019 plea\n\nImmediately after the concclusion of the hearing, a battery of lawyers, led by Fali Nariman, Kapil Sibal and Harish Salve, rushed to the court of Chief of Justice of India T.S. Thakur to press the need for the setting up of a five-judge Constitution Bench so that the petitions could be heard soon.\n\nThe lawyers said the issues raised in the petitions were politically sensitive and also of the utmost importance from the Constitutional point of view.\n\nThe court of Justice Khehar had on Wednesday ordered a freeze on the holding of proceedings of the politically embattled Arunachal Pradesh Assembly till Monday.\n\nSpeakers\u2019 removal\n\nThe petitions were triggered by alleged removal of Arunachal Pradesh Assembly Speaker Nabam Rebia followed by certain orders passed by the Gauhati High Court and decisions taken by the Governor and the Deputy Speaker.\n\nHe was removed as Speaker as 14 rebel Congress MLAs, who have been disqualified by the Speaker, joined hands with those of the Bharatiya Janata Party on December 16 in an Assembly session, presided over by the Deputy Speaker, held in a community hall in Itanagar.",
