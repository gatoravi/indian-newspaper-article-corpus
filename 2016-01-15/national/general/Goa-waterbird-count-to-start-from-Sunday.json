It will indicate trends in decrease or increase in the number of birds in our wetlands which in turn point to the health of the habitats,\u201d said Mr. Rangnekar.\n\nThe AGWC aims at documenting, collating data, undertake awareness programmes, and citizen science initiatives with respect to birds and their habitats.",
