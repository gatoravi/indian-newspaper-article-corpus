Subramanium\n\nAfter a gap of 26 years, dogs of the Indian Army trained for bomb disposal and counter-insurgency, will march on the Rajpath as part of the Republic Day parade on January 26.\n\nThere are about 1,200 Labradors and German Shepherds with the Army of which 36 have been selected for the march past along with their handlers.\n\nThe Army raised a dog training school on March 1, 1960, at Meerut for basic training while advanced training is done at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre and College which includes specialist functions like explosive detection, mine detection, tracking, and guarding, among others.\n\nThe corps with the motto, Pashu Seva Ashmakam Dharm (service to animals is our duty), has so far won one Shourya Chakra, six Sena Medals, 142 Chief of Army Staff Commendation Cards, six VCOAS Commendation Cards and 448 General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Commendation Cards.\n\nHowever, the Army recently faced criticism after it came to light that animals in the service were put to sleep after they were retired from service. After a Public Interest Litigation in the Delhi High Court, the Army has stopped the policy and stated that it would come out with a new policy within six months.",
