Popular music composer Uttam Singh was awarded the S.D. Burman International Award.\n\nThe PIFF, which began in 2002 and has witnessed growing popularity over the decade, saw less than 4,500 delegates register amid numerous accusations by cinephiles of \u201cpoor management.\u201d The figure is a steep fall compared to last year, when close to 10,000 delegates had registered. Since 2011, the PIFF has been steadily registering a delegate footfall of more than 9,000.\n\nHowever, PIFF director Jabbar Patel was quick to point out that the festival had lost none of its sheen and the number of delegates only reflected the online registration statistics. \u201cWe have provisions for on-the-spot registration as well. The turnout will be robust as in previous editions of the festival,\u201d he said, before the start of the inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe function took place in the presence of an international film jury, which includes noted Indian director Govind Nihalani, Serbian film critic Nenad Dukic, Danish director Nils Malmros, Indian actor Malaya Goswami, Argentinean director Pablo Cesar, Italian director Fabrizio Ferrari, American director Daniel Raim and Iranian director Reza Dormishian.\n\nThe main attraction of the day was the screening of the 2015 Mexican film The Thin Yellow Line , directed by Celso R. Garcia. The film, already a proven crowd-pleaser in its international screenings, is one of fourteen films short-listed by Mexico to be their submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nA steep fall in the number of delegates who have registered for the festival this year",
