It\u2019s astonishing to think that such large features could have avoided detection for so long,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Stewart Jamieson from Durham University in Britain in a paper published in the journal Geology .\n\nVery few measurements of the ice thickness have been carried out in this particular area of the Antarctic, which has led to scientists dubbing it one of Antarctica\u2019s two \u201cPoles of Ignorance.\u201d\u2014 IANS",
